### Day #192 Corporal works of Mercy ‚Äì Bury the dead

In today‚Äôs reading of Tobit, we see that Tobit is almost risking his life to bury the dead. It can seem kind of unnecessary to us because the person is dead. But it‚Äôs an act of showing respect for life, all life comes from God and the soul returns to God. The Catholic Church recognizes that this as an important part of one‚Äôs faith and hence is part of the 7-corporal works of mercy, which are
Feed the Hungry
Give Drink to the Thirsty
Clothe the Naked
Shelter the Homeless
Visit the Sick
Visit the Imprisoned
Bury the Dead
Tobit was one zealous person doing this mercy work, he would steal the bodies and give them a good burial. Even though he received many warnings he did not stop. In one incidence he was about to have a feast ‚Äì the food was spread out, and with the abundance of food he wanted to invite any of his people who may need a meal. His son found an Israelite strangled ‚Äì Tobit left his feast meal to go and do this act of Mercy.
During the time of Covid, many heroic people risked their lives like Tobit to give the dead a proper burial. Let us cultivate this habit of showing concern towards the family who lost a loved one, by going to the funeral, sending the family a card/flowers, or better still offering a Mass for the soul of the dearly departed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 192 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 1:2-20
Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed during the time of Abraham, which was more than a thousand years before Isaiah was born. But although Isaiah was preaching to Jerusalem he referred to them as Sodom and Gomorrah.

The towns of Sodom and Gomorrah were blessed with flourishing prosperity, but the people squandered all their blessings by doing evil. Israel was doing the same.

The Israelites were the most blessed people on earth. They were the people to whom the Law of God was given, they had the wisdom of Solomon, and they had the Davidic kingdom of God but they squandered all their blessings on false gods, led immoral lives and ignored the Almighty God by ignoring His desire completely. They performed robotic rituals and ensured that they did everything that the Mosaic Law commanded, but they ignored the oppression and suffering of the widows and orphans whom they were supposed to care for like their own.
Eventually the children followed the example of the elders.

But Israel's story is our story.

Like them we too sometimes attend Mass like robots, we pray like robots, we observe all the prescribed festivals, etc. and we may be checking everything on the list, but we live unholy lives, we rarely go for Confession, we spend our money on false gods (entertainment, luxury goods, etc.),  and we ignore God's desire by ignoring the less fortunate ones around us.

God wants us to love Him by leading holy lives and caring for the less fortunate ones around us. Thus our physical life will reflect our spiritual life and will be a blessing to all around us.

Isaiah 2:2‚Äì5
Isaiah was shown a vision of a peaceful world in the future where all people would be walking towards the new Jerusalem (the Church).  A world where criminals would discard their weapons and take up agricultural tools; a world where there would be no war, but only peace because, through the sacraments, the Holy Spirit would empower the people to forgive their offenders and live the law of love.
This was God‚Äôs plan for the new earth after the Resurrection of Jesus.

Let us therefore live in obedience to God and walk in His light so that God can use us to bring Heaven down on earth.
