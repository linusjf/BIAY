### Day #192 Corporal works of Mercy ‚Äì Bury the dead

In today‚Äôs reading of Tobit, we see that Tobit is almost risking his life to bury the dead. It can seem kind of unnecessary to us because the person is dead. But it‚Äôs an act of showing respect for life, all life comes from God and the soul returns to God. The Catholic Church recognizes that this as an important part of one‚Äôs faith and hence is part of the 7-corporal works of mercy, which are
Feed the Hungry
Give Drink to the Thirsty
Clothe the Naked
Shelter the Homeless
Visit the Sick
Visit the Imprisoned
Bury the Dead
Tobit was one zealous person doing this mercy work, he would steal the bodies and give them a good burial. Even though he received many warnings he did not stop. In one incidence he was about to have a feast ‚Äì the food was spread out, and with the abundance of food he wanted to invite any of his people who may need a meal. His son found an Israelite strangled ‚Äì Tobit left his feast meal to go and do this act of Mercy.
During the time of Covid, many heroic people risked their lives like Tobit to give the dead a proper burial. Let us cultivate this habit of showing concern towards the family who lost a loved one, by going to the funeral, sending the family a card/flowers, or better still offering a Mass for the soul of the dearly departed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
