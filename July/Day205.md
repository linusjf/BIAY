### Day #205 Fear not for God is in our midst

We know that the Israelites have been going through a rough spiritual journey and were exiled from the promised land. Imagine how fearful and shameful they must be, Zephaniah’s prophecy starts with woes but end with comfort and restoration. The restoration will happen through Jesus – Emmanuel God in our midst, he will strengthen the weak hands, he is the warrior that went into battle for us and came out victorious, love and forgiveness were his weapons.
He now rejoices over us in gladness and he renews us in his love, exults over us with loud singing

On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
Do not fear, O Zion;
do not let your hands grow weak.
The LORD, your God, is in your midst,
a warrior who gives victory;
he will rejoice over you with gladness,
he will renew you in his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing
as on a day of festival. Zep 3:16-18

When darkness encamps you and you feel like there is no one who cares for you, remember that God is in our midst, He is Jesus, who cares for us and rejoices over us. He is our warrior who is fighting for us and if God is on our side, who can be against us?

He leads us with gentle whispering like a good shepherd he leads us to green pastures.

Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” Is 30:21

He calls us by name and is pleased with us, Jesus loves us more than we can imagine.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 30:1-33 & 31:1-9
In times of trouble the Israelites put their trust in their ancient enemies, the Egyptians, instead of obeying and trusting in the Lord.
Pagan Egypt was a symbol of the evil world.

So often, in times of trouble, we too put our trust in the evil world who does not want to believe in or hear about the Lord, because we want our problems to be solved instantly and according to our plans and so we don't mind lying or we don't mind bribing our way through or using people to solve our problems illegally, because that is the normal way the world solves problems. We don't have the patience to wait for God to solve our problems because God's solutions always involve sufferings and delays.

The Lord wants us to obey Him and put our trust in Him (Isaiah 31:6) because only He can give us the perfect solution for our problems.  The sufferings and delays are meant to purify us or change us spiritually, while we wait.
