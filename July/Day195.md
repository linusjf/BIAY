### Day #195 Physical intimacy is a sign and pledge of spiritual communion

We read about Tobias and Sarah‚Äôs beautiful example of keeping the marriage bed holy.
Sarah was possessed by a daemon and her previous 7 husbands were killed on the night of the marriage. But Tobias was unlike them, he was not driven by lust but had a good realization of the spiritual connection that spouses have and that God should be welcomed into every marital act by prayer.
Then Tobias remembered the words of Raphael, and he took the fish‚Äôs liver and heart out of the bag where he had them and put them on the embers of the incense. 3 The odor of the fish so repelled the demon that he fled to the remotest parts of Egypt. But Raphael followed him, and at once bound him there hand and foot.Tobit 8:2-3
How important it is to remember instruction and to follow the guidance given to us. Now the parents of Sarah had no hope, they even dug up a grave to bury Tobias.
When the parents had gone out and shut the door of the room, Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, ‚ÄúSister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety.‚Äù 5 So she got up, and they began to pray and implore that they might be kept safe. Tobit 8:4,5
Praying as a couple is vital and very important, even praying before the marital act is a good practice that will keep lust at check. It is essential to keep the spouse‚Äôs well-being in mind, this will ensure one is not operating out of lust but out of love. Praying helps invite God into the union of husband and wife, as it is a spiritual union as well. When we invite God we have to be open to life ‚Äì which rules out any forms of contraception(The Catholic Church encourages Natural family planning).
I recall this case where a couple was not able to conceive for many years, this was because they had used birth control when they didn‚Äôt want a child. After a good confession, they finally were able to conceive and bear a healthy baby. God needs to be welcome in the marital act, it is not a purely biological act ‚Äì it is spiritual as well ‚Äì as soul is created.
The below notes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church are beautiful.

2360. Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament.

2361. "Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not simply something biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until death." 143

2362. The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family.

The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and fecundity.
The clear takeaway is that the Marital act is a holy act that should help sanctify the marriage. It should be in a prayerful and joyful environment. Spouses should care for one another, look out for each other‚Äôs good and be open to life.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
