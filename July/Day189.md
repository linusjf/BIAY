### Day #189 Wisdom is better than gold

If you were asked to choose between a large amount of money and God, what would you pick?
Would you be satisfied with all the wealth and comforts this world can offer? I don’t think that perfect health, wealth, beauty, stuff, or people can ever satisfy us, if it was so then all the rich people would be happy all the healthy people would be joyful, and all the beautiful people would feel whole.
We all are created to be loved by God and only in Him will we be complete.
Now the path to the whole life/holy life is what prepares us to be complete/whole/satisfied/fulfilled. It is the journey that shapes us like a diamond that needs to be chiseled and polished to shine its best, we are being formed in our spiritual lives every day, through every challenge/situation/difficulty/sickness/God’s word/God experience.
One reason for us not growing in our spiritual lives could be “we love sin too much”. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, we need to be able to hate our sin, rather than take pleasure in it – it’s easier said than done – because our flesh is drawn towards gratifying ourselves.
We need to seek wisdom more than we seek things of this world, we need to make an effort to learn from the Lord. Seek instruction rather than silver and knowledge rather than gold. We should dwell in prudence and find knowledge in discretion.
However, all this knowledge should be governed by wisdom and a willing spirit.
Knowledge is knowing stuff, but wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge and a willing spirit is what helps us to do the things we are called to. – Michael Eltham 🤣
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength. Pr 8:10-14
When we seek wisdom we will have counsel, insight, and strength to do the will of the Lord
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 189 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 23:1-25
Hilkiah found the Book of the Law (2 Kings 22:8), Shaphan read it to King Josiah (2 Kings 22:10) and a great spiritual revival took place in the whole country.  All idols (Baal, Asherah, Molech, etc.) and evil practices were destroyed and people were restored back to God by renewing the Covenant.

We too are called to do the same.
Let us stop idolizing our jobs, money, positions, possessions, talents, etc.
Then let us renew our Covenant with God by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) and the Eucharist (Communion) regularly.
Let us reform ourselves first, and then reform the little community around us by reading the Word of God and sharing it with our families, friends and neighborhood.

2 Kings 23:29
Inspite of all the spiritual revival which Josiah brought about, in the end he made a mistake by taking his own decision, instead of consulting God, before deciding to go into battle, thus causing his own destruction.

Whenever there’s an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is always strong resistance from the demonic.
When things start going well for us and we are walking with the Lord, Satan steps in with flatteries and extra appreciation thus making us a little over-confident.  We gradually develop pride and end up in Satan’s team.  Satan does it so smoothly that we don’t even realize when and how we ended up walking with him.

Let us therefore be guided by God’s Word in all we do and say and apply it to our lives every day.  Let us not make the error of misusing God’s Word to fit our agenda.
