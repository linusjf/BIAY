### Day #189 Wisdom is better than gold

If you were asked to choose between a large amount of money and God, what would you pick?
Would you be satisfied with all the wealth and comforts this world can offer? I don‚Äôt think that perfect health, wealth, beauty, stuff, or people can ever satisfy us, if it was so then all the rich people would be happy all the healthy people would be joyful, and all the beautiful people would feel whole.
We all are created to be loved by God and only in Him will we be complete.
Now the path to the whole life/holy life is what prepares us to be complete/whole/satisfied/fulfilled. It is the journey that shapes us like a diamond that needs to be chiseled and polished to shine its best, we are being formed in our spiritual lives every day, through every challenge/situation/difficulty/sickness/God‚Äôs word/God experience.
One reason for us not growing in our spiritual lives could be ‚Äúwe love sin too much‚Äù. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, we need to be able to hate our sin, rather than take pleasure in it ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier said than done ‚Äì because our flesh is drawn towards gratifying ourselves.
We need to seek wisdom more than we seek things of this world, we need to make an effort to learn from the Lord. Seek instruction rather than silver and knowledge rather than gold. We should dwell in prudence and find knowledge in discretion.
However, all this knowledge should be governed by wisdom and a willing spirit.
Knowledge is knowing stuff, but wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge and a willing spirit is what helps us to do the things we are called to. ‚Äì Michael Eltham ü§£
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength. Pr 8:10-14
When we seek wisdom we will have counsel, insight, and strength to do the will of the Lord
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
