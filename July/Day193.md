### Day #193 Archangel Raphael (God heals)- healing of sight to Tobit

One way to remember the Archangels is as below
‚ÄúThe Archangel of light, sight, and fight ‚Äì Archangel of light is Gabriel, sight is Raphael and fight is Michael ‚Äú
We see a mention of Archangel Raphael in the book of Tobit,
At that very moment, the prayers of both of them were heard in the glorious presence of God. So Raphael was sent to heal both of them: Tobit, by removing the white films from his eyes, so that he might see God‚Äôs light with his eyes; and Sarah, daughter of Raguel, by giving her in marriage to Tobias son of Tobit, and by setting her free from the wicked demon Asmodeus. Tobit 3:16,17
We usually do not pay much attention to the presence of angels or their actions. Almost everything in our lives involves angles, we have a guardian angel always with us, when we pray, our prayers are carried by angels and presented to God. When God wants to bring us healing or work Miracles or do anything ‚Äì Angels are dispatched with work orders. The angles are God‚Äôs army of workers, just doing the will of God. Raphael is one of the three Archangels ‚Äì who is attributed to healing and deliverance. We see Raphael is instrumental in the healing of Tobit‚Äôs sight and deliverance of Raquel. The angel's name Raphael means ‚ÄúGod heals‚Äù.
Although only the archangels Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name in the New Testament, the Gospel of John speaks of the pool at Bethesda, where many ill people rested, awaiting the moving of the water. "An angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under" John 5:1-4. Because of the healing powers often linked to Raphael, the angel spoken of is generally associated with St. Raphael, the Archangel.
Raphael is also attributed to ‚ÄúHappy meetings‚Äù because we read in Tobit that he made the meeting of Tobit and Sarah happen soon after Tobit received his sight back. Tobias was next in line - entitled to marry Sarah.
At the same time that Tobit returned from the courtyard into his house, Sarah daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.
We can always pray to St Raphael for our healing and for those seeking life partners.
O Raphael, lead us towards those we are waiting for, those who are waiting for us! Raphael, Angel of Happy Meetings, lead us by the hand towards those we are looking for! May all our movements, all their movements, be guided by your Light and transfigured by your Joy. Angel Guide of Tobias, lay the request we now address to you at the feet of Him on whose unveiled Face you are privileged to gaze. Lonely and tired, crushed by the separations and sorrows of earth, we feel the need of calling to you and of pleading for the protection of your wings, so that we may not be as strangers in the Province of Joy, all ignorant of the concerns of our country. Remember the weak, you who are strong--you whose home lies beyond the region of thunder, in a land that is always peaceful, always serene, and bright with the resplendent glory of God. Amen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
