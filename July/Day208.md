### Day #208 False gods, idols, and superstition

Baruch 6 goes on and on about the false gods and idols, it seems almost repetitive. The idols made by man ‚Äì made of wood, gold, and silver have no feelings and cannot do you any good or harm. It can be hard to worship an idol for that seems kind of stupid, but some people can be fearful that those objects may have some evil power over you.
Baruch reminds us not to be fearful of those false gods and religions.
Thus is it in no way apparent to us that they are gods; so do not fear them. For like a scarecrow in a cucumber patch, providing no protection, are their wooden, gilded, silvered gods. Baruch 6:69-70
Another thing that is false is superstitions like ‚Äúcrossing paths with a black cat brings bad luck ‚Äù, ‚Äúcracked mirror brings bad luck‚Äù, and ‚ÄúA rabbit's foot will bring you luck‚Äù. These are just a few examples, but you get the idea ‚Äì placing your faith in these practices is idolatry because you believe more in the black cat/mirror/dead rabbits‚Äô foot than in Jesus Christ.

We need to recognize that every power in this world is weaker than God, the creator of the world. We should not have any fear of these false gods or idols.
The one fear that people may have, is the demonic influence on these objects. Occult or demonic influence on these objects is possible and it can affect you if you let it. The devil and the fallen angels can use anything to affect you, but that is only if you open yourself to it due to an unconfessed sin or a habitual sin that gives the devil an entry point. Let us remember that God in us is greater than any evil spirit in the world.
You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.1 John 4:4
Let us not have any superstitions or fears of evil but rejoice that the Spirit of Christ in our hearts is greater than anything else we may face.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
