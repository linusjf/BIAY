### Day #213 Shutting God out of our lives

One pitfall to Christians would be to shut God out of certain areas of our lives. We tend to make an idol of the true God, that is we make God in our own image and likeness instead of being shaped by Him. We are clay and He is the potter, can the clay decide on its shape should be?
Sometimes we want to shut God out of certain areas of life and give into our own desires and designs.
A few examples:

1. We can decide that using contraceptives is a good practice and shut God out of our lives instead of being open to life.
2. We can decide that “Just being a good person will get us to heaven – and do not have any relationship with God”
3. We can determine that there is no need to go to church once a week, just praying at home and reading your bible is enough
4. We can decide that there is no need to go to confession, I will confess my sins straight to God.
5. We can decide that Jesus is not present in the Blessed Sacrament, it’s just a piece of bread
   The prophet Isaiah warns us about this, of being self-contained and satisfied, of being our own god.
   You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, “No one sees me”; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” 11 But evil shall come upon you, for which you cannot atone; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to expiate; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing. Is 47:10,11
   We just cannot continue in our wickedness or by believing our own truth. Relativism is taking over young minds, and everyone wants to believe their own truth. It’s not about what you think or I think, it’s about what God wants for us, How does he want to be worshiped? What is He calling us to?
   God created us and knows best, let us listen to Him.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
