### Day #212 I will go before you

When we are asked to do something new or when change arises, we tend to fear. We feel afraid when we have a big task at hand either at work or church or at home. We sometimes feel that we are all alone and no one is supporting us. If you have chronic conditions and feel that there is limited or no medical treatment.
If you are facing any situation that makes you fearful and you have hit a roadblock, pray the below verse over and over again. For God will go before you and level the mountains, break in pieces the doors of bronze, and break the bars of iron.
‚ÄúI will go before you and level the mountains, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut asunder the bars of iron, 3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoards in secret places, that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who call you by your name. 4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. Is 45:2-4
There will be a great breakthrough for those who pray this verse repeatedly. God will give great treasures to those who persevere and push forward in prayer. God has called us by name and surnamed us as well. Let us not fear but trust in God who goes before us.
The God who created us and knows us even before we were created, will sustain us and care for us even till our old age when we get gray.
who have been borne by me from your birth, carried from the womb; 4 even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. Is 46:3,4
As one ages they tend to feel abandoned and left out by society and family. Older people feel as though everything is ending and they don‚Äôt have anyone who cares for them. Remember that God is on your side, He cares for you ‚Äì He is the same yesterday, today, and forever ‚Äì whether you are young or old. Even if society and family leave you, God will never abandon you. Rest assured that God is on your side and he goes before you leveling all the mountains and breaking all the gates that come in your way.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 212 By Sheila

ISAIAH begins with Cyrus as God's lnstrument anointed and subdued before HIM. To break and open lron Gates, Bronze Bars. To know hidden, secret places of rich treasure no one can see.
I The Lord do all these things, even though Cyrus did not acknowledge God.
In the past, Prophets and Holy Men were anointed to do the Lord's Work. What a mighty contrast, His own people have neglected and do not carry Him. Rather they carry idols, loaded on over burdened beasts.
EZEKIEL: expresses in Prophetic Writings and refers to the Day of The Lord. A time of decisive judgement, a point of utter destruction, to those who dwell in the land. The daily routine of life as God's people would end.
PROVERBS: We eventually become that on which we allow our minds to dwell. Words can bring satisfaction when they are wise or disaster when unwise.
Let's bear words as deeds that bear fruits.
