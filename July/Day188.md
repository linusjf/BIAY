### Day #188 Avoid the near occasion of sin

In today‚Äôs proverb, we can find some good advice about living a chaste life. The example given is about a young man who seems to have gone the wrong way. The author of the proverb looks out of the window of his house and notices a senseless young man among the simple. This youth seems to be walking the streets and looking for this woman. This woman is not a harlot, but a married woman dressed like a harlot. The woman‚Äôs husband has gone on a long journey, and she seems to be on every street corner trying to seduce the youth.
Now no one knows if this story is true or not, but the takeaway for us should be the warning. The young man needs to be careful about the path he takes, for he may take a path that has trapped many and led them to hell. Let us read this warning for ourselves and be warned.
With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. Prov 7: 22-27
Now, this can be taken literally and is very relevant to our generation, where there are so many extramarital relationships. I assume that most of us reading this do not struggle with the sin of marital fidelity, we can apply this to any sin. The devil is a roaring lion roaming everywhere, trying to find someone to devour. We have to be careful not to entertain sin too much or the near occasion of sin, lest the devil will afflict us/devour us.
Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. 1 Pet 5:8
We also need to guard ourselves against our flesh, for if we do not be careful, we can easily fall into sin.
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.‚Äù Gen 4:7
This warning was given to Cain, we should also heed it and master our flesh and sin.
Let us be watchful in prayer and avoid the near occasion of sin. Sin can arise from the world, the flesh, or the devil, let us be aware and vigilant and heed the warning of the author of the proverb.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
