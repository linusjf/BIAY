### Day #209 Those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength

God’s people have been in distress – as they are exiled because of their unfaithfulness. God has not abandoned them but journeyed with them. God only wants them to change their hearts so that they can return to him. God speaks words of Comfort to Isaiah.
Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. Is 40:1,2
When the word comfort is used – one would usually think of a cool Air-conditioned room with a comfortable couch and a cool drink. But God’s comfort is to be found only in us repnting from the evil that we are doing. The comfort of the Lord can be found when we repent, rend our hearts and seek after him. The comfort of God can be found when we prepare the way for the Lord. When we make straight the paths, level the mountains and welcome God into our hearts.
A voice cries out: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” Is 40:3-5
John the Baptist was that voice that cried out in the wilderness, and the church now cries out every advent and lent – asking us to repent and to receive God’s comfort. We are also called to repent every time we fall, we are called to repent in the sacrament of confession. Every parish cries out through its scheduled confessions every week - a call to repent.
Because once we repent and seek the Lord, He will renew our strength. He will give power to the faint, and strength to the powerless. Even if the young and strong of the world fail, those who wait on the Lord will never faint but will renew their strength. We will mount up with wings like eagles.
The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.
Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. Is 40:28-31
May you feel comfort by repenting and renew your strength today.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 40:3
\*A voice cries out in the wilderness, “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”\*

Isaiah was prophesying about the arrival of a prophet (John the Baptist) who would prepare the people for the arrival of the Messiah into their hearts by calling them to repentance.  Meanwhile, Jesus Himself would prepare a pure vessel (Mary) for His arrival into the world because God would not enter an unclean heart or an unclean womb.

Isaiah 40:9-11
In the ancient pagan world, a king/emperor was worshipped as god, and the birth of a son, the heir to the throne, was announced as "good news" ("evangelion" in Greek) because the heir was believed to be the son of god (the king/ emperor), who would save their people from their physical enemies.

Isaiah used the same concept to announce the good news of the birth of the future king and God of Israel who would save them from their enemies and oppression.

The Jews were suffering in exile because their sins and non-repentance had separated them from God.  When they repented, God promised to come down Himself, as their good shepherd king, to save them.

The Judeans did receive a king in the future who delivered them from physical exile but Isaiah was also prophetically speaking of the ultimate divine king Jesus who would save them and us from spiritual exile.
