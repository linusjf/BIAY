### Israel Falls to Assyria

### Day #183 God permits suffering when we stray from Him, only so that it may cause us to return to the straight path.

Most parents must have corrected the kids this way ‚ÄúClean your room or else no Ice cream tonight‚Äù. This is called reward-based training, something that we even follow when we train a puppy. And when the kids make mistakes, they are grounded or their toys are taken away until they learn a lesson.
The Israelites needed some tough love from the Lord, because of their continuous sins, their rebellion, and stiff-neckedness.
Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, ‚ÄúTurn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.‚Äù They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence. 2 Kings 17:13,14, 18,19
The Lord after giving them numerous chances, and sending many prophets with warning messages finally just lifted His hedge from the Israelites and they were exposed to their enemies. The whole of Israelites is now away from the presence of the Lord.
This is the case sometimes with us as well, we are so pigheaded that we just want to have our way with everything. We just want to continue in our sin and gratify our cravings, give in to temptations, and just do not want to listen to God and do not want to follow His teachings. The Lord is patient, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, however, He is a good parent as well. He will not spare the rod and spoil the kid, God will allow some suffering which will possibly cause us to think of our father‚Äôs house, like the prodigal son and we would possibly return home. Let us return to the arms of the Father.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 17:5-9 & 24

\*Then the king of Assyria occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years.  The king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.  This came about because the Israelites sinned against the LORD, their God by adopting unlawful practices and worshipping idols like the pagan nations around them.\*

The king of Assyria scattered the Israelites all over the surrounding pagan nations, then brought 5 pagan nations to inhabit Samaria so that the pagans could have mixed marriages with the Israelites, with the intention that the Israelites would lose their bloodline, their culture, their religion, and their allegiance to their king, thus preventing the possibility of future rebellion.  These mixed descendants came to be known as the Samaritans.

After being scattered because of their sins, if the Israelites would have repented and turned back to God, then even if they had married the pagans they would have been able to bring all their pagan spouses and in-laws to God and the ten tribes would not have been lost.

Like the Israelites, we too are called to be holy.  We must live our lives like Christ did.  When we have mixed marriages, one of the ways we can evangelize our non-Christian spouses and in-laws is by living our Christian life faithfully so that we can bring them to Christ.  But when we start living our lives like the non-Christians to please our spouses and in-laws, then, like those 10 tribes of Israel, our Christian community too will start diminishing.

Micah 5:2-3

\*But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.\*

This was the text which led the magi to Jerusalem to look for the Messiah, but they didn't find Him in the palace. And when King Herod enquired about it his priests knew what was already prophesied through Micah.

God chose a small insignificant town for His Son to be born, and through the womb of an even more insignificant woman.

God uses less to do more. God uses something negligible to do something large.
We don't have to be famous or popular for God to use us for His divine mission. We don't even have to be experts or perfect in anything. He will use our mistakes to teach us. He only wants our "yes" for Him to start using us.

\*Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.\*

God would hand over His people to their enemies until the time the Messiah would come into the world and deliver them from slavery.

Thus, when Jesus came to earth, Israel was physically under the oppression of the Romans because of their sins but Jesus gave them hope for liberation from spiritual slavery (forgiveness of sins) for those who accepted Him.

Micah  6:7-8
\*Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?‚Äù\*

Micah was referring to the king of Moab who offered his first born son and defeat was turned to victory. Therefore the demon-inspired people around Israel were trapping themselves into all kinds of infernal powers and thus tempted the people of God to look elsewhere for their own source of power (2 Kings 3:27).

\*He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\*

God has already told us what He wants us to do to receive eternal life but, like those Israelites, we too choose to go our own way.  God is not asking us to perform any Herculean task; all that He wants from us is to be just, kind and humble and obey His commandments.

### DAY 183: By Sheila

KINGS: In the 12Year of King Ahaz, Hoshea reigns Samaria for 9Years. Shalmanesar attacked, settled the territory and carried away the Israelites to Assyrian Cities.
Israel's Sins: Hence began Intermarriages, the worship of idols, violation of God's Law and improper Worship of God.
MICAH: The City Jerusalem would suffer seige because of its sins. The Birth Place of the Shepherd King would be Bethlehem. By predicting a New King from Bethlehem, Micah was invoking the Covenant God made with David Centuries later, at the Birth of Jesus, where the Wise Men question, concerning where the Christ was to be born.
Judah's Kings were insecure as strength, to assure lasting peace for God's Chosen People. JESUS, The Great King Of Israel is Our Only Peace.
God would not stop with only Redeeming a remnant of Israel, theirs would be the Presence of God's people, would be to the Nation's like Life-Giving Water. The Prophet Micah revealed, they would also be like a 'lion' among the Gentiles as St. Paul describes the Church in 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.
God has a legal court case then for violation of the Covenant. He called the Hills and Mountains, who had witnessed Israel's transgressions to hear the case.
What had God done to deserve rejection of His Covenant? Had HE not Supernaturally redeemed them from slavery in Egypt?
God reminded them of events during their Wilderness Journey that revealed His Righteousness and Power.
God's people gave no explanation to His Question. God connected His people through Micah by demanding Justice, Mercy and Obedience, qualities lacking in Judah.
Messages of 8th Century Prophets: Amos called for Justice. Hosea kindness. Isaiah to obey and to walk humbly with God. Micah stated boldly that only God could right such wrong. He encouraged through suffering in Judgment was certain, it was also temporary. Micah prayed for protection too.
Psalm: The Psalmist  expressed in confidence that only God can deliver from the power of evil men and punish the evil-doers.
Let's put our confidence in faith that GOD is our Deliverer.
