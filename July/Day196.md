### Day #196 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light

If you haven't seen one of those videos of a blind person seeing for the first time, you should - it's amazing. Imagine there is a power outage and we have no candles or generators or cell phones, we would eagerly wait for the power to come back on. because we don't like the dark.
The human race was in great darkness, the chosen nation Israel has abandoned God and are exiled, and there seems to be no light at the end of this tunnel. The Gentile nations are barbarous and worship false gods. These words of Isiah are of great importance as he is announcing the birth of Jesus our savior.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness‚Äî on them light has shined.
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Is 9:2,4,6
There is Hope, hope in the form of a child. One would expect a Mighty King with a great army, but God‚Äôs ways are not our ways. We are given a child, an innocent baby Jesus who will liberate us not by force but by love.
He will carry our burdens on His shoulders and break the bond of sin, once and for all.
He is the light of the world that has come into darkness. A very bright light has been turned on ‚Äì we can see because of Jesus. We who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, we who were blind can now see.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
