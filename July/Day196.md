### Day #196 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light

If you haven't seen one of those videos of a blind person seeing for the first time, you should - it's amazing. Imagine there is a power outage and we have no candles or generators or cell phones, we would eagerly wait for the power to come back on. because we don't like the dark.
The human race was in great darkness, the chosen nation Israel has abandoned God and are exiled, and there seems to be no light at the end of this tunnel. The Gentile nations are barbarous and worship false gods. These words of Isiah are of great importance as he is announcing the birth of Jesus our savior.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness— on them light has shined.
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Is 9:2,4,6
There is Hope, hope in the form of a child. One would expect a Mighty King with a great army, but God’s ways are not our ways. We are given a child, an innocent baby Jesus who will liberate us not by force but by love.
He will carry our burdens on His shoulders and break the bond of sin, once and for all.
He is the light of the world that has come into darkness. A very bright light has been turned on – we can see because of Jesus. We who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, we who were blind can now see.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 9:1-6

\*The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; Upon those who lived in a land of gloom a light has shone.\*
In the future, the people who suffered in exile would see Jesus, the light of the world.

\*For the yoke that burdened them, the pole on their shoulder, the rod of their taskmaster, you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.\*
The yoke of the old law with more than 613 Commandments would be made light with the new law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love and the power of the Holy Spirit through the sacraments.

“The day of Midian” is the day when God used the judge Gideon to deliver the northern territories from Midianite oppression (Judges chapters 6 & 7).

\*For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests.\*
\*They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.\*
\*His dominion is vast and will be forever peaceful, upon David’s throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever.\*
This Son would be the Messiah (Jesus) who would redeem the suffering people and re-establish the kingdom of David.

Isaiah 10:5-16
God allows evil because He wants to draw some good out of it.
Assyria was an evil superpower during the 8th century BC, and God would eventually punish them for their evil deeds. But before punishing them, and because they were evil, God was using them, like a carpenter uses a saw, to punish His people, the Israelites, for living in disobedience to His commandments. But the Assyrians, in their pride and arrogance, did not attribute their success to God. They thought they were winning wars because of their physical and material (weapon) strength and their intelligence.

Because of their pride and arrogance, the Assyrians lacked the humility to realize that God was using them in His plan for salvation.  Therefore they lost the chance to have a relationship with the Almighty God.

When our country is *threatened* by our neighbors, it is a *warning* for us from God that we are not leading our lives according to His Will and He is giving us a chance to repent, correct our errors and change our lives.
When our country is *attacked* by our neighbors, it is a *punishment* for us from God because we have not repented and corrected our errors inspite of His warnings.

Punishment is therapeutic.  It is meant to heal us spiritually.  But if we put our full faith and trust in our human strength (weapons) and in our human intelligence to protect ourselves, and we still don’t repent, then our destruction is inevitable.

The Holy Spirit who dwells within us from the time we are baptized, is greater than any worldly power which is dominated by evil spirits (1 John 4:4).

Therefore, if we are being attacked or threatened by any of our neighboring countries, we need to examine our conscience and our way of living and repent if we are guilty of sin.
Let us work hard to keep our souls purified at all times, and in every negative situation, let us put our faith and trust in God, and not in our human strength and intelligence.

Tobit 12:8
\*Prayer with fasting is good, but better than both is almsgiving with righteousness.\*
This does not mean almsgiving is more important than prayer & fasting. “Righteousness” means “living in total obedience to God” which also includes prayer & fasting. Therefore, there is no point in spending our time in prayer & fasting if we don't care about the poor and needy, and if we don't obey God completely.
