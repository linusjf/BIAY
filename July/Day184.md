### Day #184 Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord

This Psalm makes for such a good prayer, that we can pray every morning.
Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds Ps 141:3,4
Many people are hurt by words, it is said that words hurt harder than punches. Words have power and they can either build up a person or tear down. Most people can remember the good and bad things that were said to them, some even remember the words they heard as children. We need to be very careful about what we say, and how we say it. The words we speak can bring destruction and cause discouragement, especially to our kids and anyone under us at work, and even our family and friends.
The mouth speaks what the heart is full of and it's very easy to speak hurtful words when we are angry or upset. Words once spoken are like a bullet fired, they cannot be taken back. We are called to tame the tongue, by practicing self-control.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one‚Äôs life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. James 3:3-6
Beautiful examples like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth, the rudder, and the ship, and the spark and the forest should help us realize that a small word spoken out of hate can cause a relationship to be set on fire, or a ship to sink, if we lose control of our tongue we will lose control of the whole body ‚Äì like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth.
Let us pray and ask the Lord to guard our mouths, and keep watch on our lips.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
