### Day #202 “Unjust scales” and “Pride” are a recipe for disaster

We read the prophecy about Tyre, which was a very rich city. We see that Tyre is increasing in wealth, it’s the center of trade and there is a lot of money and wealth and buildings and towers. However, the city is becoming increasingly corrupt and the people who live in it are very proud and unjust. All this will end in the downfall of the city of Tyre
We also see a similar situation in Habakkuk, the prophet is calling out the injustice that is happening and the consequences that it will have.

“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
setting his nest on high
to escape the clutches of ruin! Hab 2:9

“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
and establishes a town by injustice! Hab 2:12

One thing that is clear is that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders are building in vail. If the house or city is based on evil means it will eventually collapse, when unjust measures are used the person/city/house may prosper for some time but will be ruined and not profit him much.

The LORD detests dishonest scales,
but accurate weights find favor with him.
When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
but with humility comes wisdom. Prov 11:1-2

The Lord detests the dishonest scales and those who make a profit from unjust dealings. Let us remember that all the money in the world cannot satisfy anyone, it will just leave them wanting more money/power/fame – only the humble will find satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Our country prints “IN GOD WE TRUST” on the currency, but do we trust in the Lord or in riches? This statement on the currency is very helpful to keep us focused on the true source of everything good – God himself.

Everything good comes from God. Every perfect gift is from him. James 1:17

Let us not use unjust scales or get proud when money accumulates, but in turn, humble ourselves and trust in the Lord for everything.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
