### Day #202 “Unjust scales” and “Pride” are a recipe for disaster

We read the prophecy about Tyre, which was a very rich city. We see that Tyre is increasing in wealth, it’s the center of trade and there is a lot of money and wealth and buildings and towers. However, the city is becoming increasingly corrupt and the people who live in it are very proud and unjust. All this will end in the downfall of the city of Tyre
We also see a similar situation in Habakkuk, the prophet is calling out the injustice that is happening and the consequences that it will have.

“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
setting his nest on high
to escape the clutches of ruin! Hab 2:9

“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
and establishes a town by injustice! Hab 2:12

One thing that is clear is that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders are building in vail. If the house or city is based on evil means it will eventually collapse, when unjust measures are used the person/city/house may prosper for some time but will be ruined and not profit him much.

The LORD detests dishonest scales,
but accurate weights find favor with him.
When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
but with humility comes wisdom. Prov 11:1-2

The Lord detests the dishonest scales and those who make a profit from unjust dealings. Let us remember that all the money in the world cannot satisfy anyone, it will just leave them wanting more money/power/fame – only the humble will find satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Our country prints “IN GOD WE TRUST” on the currency, but do we trust in the Lord or in riches? This statement on the currency is very helpful to keep us focused on the true source of everything good – God himself.

Everything good comes from God. Every perfect gift is from him. James 1:17

Let us not use unjust scales or get proud when money accumulates, but in turn, humble ourselves and trust in the Lord for everything.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 202 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 24:5
*The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants, for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.*
Breaking a covenant was considered a serious crime and with their immorality, disobedience, rebellion and pride, mankind has broken the covenant which God had made with them, but God did not give mankind any severe punishment for their infidelity.  Instead, Jesus took upon himself the severe punishment which we deserved for breaking the covenant.

People have defiled the earth by breaking God’s laws and by violating the covenant which He made to last forever.  So God pronounced a curse on the earth.  Its people are paying for what they have done.

Habakkuk 1:2-3
*O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and thou wilt not hear?*
*Or cry to thee “Violence!” and thou wilt not save?*
*Why dost thou make me see wrongs and look upon trouble?*
*Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.*

The strife and discord we face in our own lives can sometimes cause us to wonder, as the prophet does, as to why God doesn’t seem to hear or intervene when we cry for help.
But let us not forget that God did not redeem us to abandon us in our trials, just as He did not redeem Israel from Egypt to let them die in the desert.   He will be with us all the way through till the end, just as He was with Israel.  He is our God and we are the people whom He shepherds always, though at times His mercy and justice seem long delayed.

In times of prolonged crisis we tend to think that God has abandoned us.
Unanswered prayers are one of those experiences which really put our faith to test.  If we are going through some trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. it is easy to start losing faith, despair and be tempted to ask “how long Lord?” or “where are you Lord?”

If our prayers have not been answered for a long time, let us not despair, for the Lord delays because He desires to do something greater for us than what we are asking for, while we are waiting in prayer, clinging to the Lord.  During this time God strengthens us spiritually.

One of the fruits of unanswered prayers is a deeper and more intense prayer.  God allows us to remain in the trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. because He wants us to grow spiritually.

We may be asking for temporal good to ease the suffering but God wants our spiritual good and therefore He delays in answering.

Habakkuk 2:2-3
Habakkuk was prophesying shortly before the Babylonians would conquer Israel. His message was one of “doom and gloom.” It was not a popular message.  God told him to write down his vision so that all could see it and prepare, or “so he may run who reads it…”  The idea was that if folks received his message and acted, they could be saved, for “the righteous shall live by his faith” as verse 4 says. It was a dark vision, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel for the faithful.
This is not a “write it and it’s yours” theology as many people believe.

Habakkuk 2:4
*Behold, he, whose soul is not upright in him, shall fail, but the righteous man shall live by his faith.*

Faith is not just about believing.  To have faith in God means to have belief as well as trust, and we can prove our trust in God by our works, that is, even when the world is against us.
