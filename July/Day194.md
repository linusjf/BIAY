### Day #194 Here Am I send me

The people of Israel are in a very poor spiritual state, the Lord has done everything possible for them – he freed them from slavery, brought them forth defeated many nations, finally they entered the promised land – a fertile land – but still did not produce good fruit, they betrayed God and rejected His love. The prophet Isiah receives this word in such beautiful poetic form with such great symbolism.
Let me sing for my beloved
my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. Is 5:1,2
Now Isiah is called to go preach to the lost people of Israel. Isiah was given a beautiful vision of heaven.
I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. 2 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3 And one called to another and said:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. 5 And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” Is 6: 1-5
God is so holy that even the angels fear looking directly at God. The Seraphs covered the feet and their eyes because even they did not feel worthy to look at God or to stand in the holy of holies.
Now Isiah feels unworthy to even see that holy image, he is like Peter(When Jesus did the Miracle of the large fish catch) who said “I am unworthy please depart from me”. Even we should come to that realization when we sing the "Holy Holy Holy" at the consecration during Mass, for we are standing in the presence of Jesus. The host truly becomes the body and blood of Christ. The prayer before communion that we pray should come from this understanding of our worthlessness. “Lord I am not worthy to receive but on say the word and my soul shall be healed”
We are purified like Isiah when the host touches our tongues, at the final commission at the end of Mass, we should respond as Isiah did. “Here am I send me”
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 194 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 5:1-7
Israel was God’s vineyard.
God gave the Israelites a hilly region filled with grape vines and fertile soil.
Then He cleared it of stones (the Amalekites) and gave them His chosen priests.
He then gave them a towering Temple but the Lord received sour grapes which were not fit to make wine.
The people broke the Covenant.

They did not observe the Sabbath, they offered incense to idols, and they rejected God.  Thus they separated themselves from God.  God, therefore, allowed them to be conquered by their enemies.

Let us check if we have been better than those Israelites.
If we have accepted Jesus then let us check if we are in Covenant with God at all times, or not.
Let us check whether we are observing Sunday Sabbath (the Lord’s day) and whether we are offering incense to the living God or to false gods (wealth, possessions, entertainment, etc.).

Isaiah 6:1-7
\*I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the hem of his robe filling the temple.  Seraphim were stationed above Him.\*
“Seraph” means “burning.”
The angels who have a spiritual fire around themselves are called “Seraphim angels (plural).”

\*One Seraph cried out to the other, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and earth are full of His glory."\*
During Mass, we join the angels and saints in glorifying God by singing this hymn which is their unending hymn of praise (Revelation 4:8).

\*At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.\*
The smoke was the indication of the presence of God in the Heavenly Temple (Exodus 40:34-38; 1 Kings 8:10-11).

\*Then I (Isaiah) said, “Woe is me, I am doomed, for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips, and yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”\*
Isaiah's words are recalled by the priests, every day during Mass, before reading the Gospel.  The Priest silently prays “Almighty God, cleanse my heart and my lips that I may worthily proclaim the Gospel."
Since no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20), Isaiah thought he was going to die because he had seen God.

Tobit 6:10-11
Sarah was held in bondage by a demon who was killing her husbands on the night of the marriage (also Tobit 7:1, 9-17; 8:4-9).

Like Sarah, we too may be held in bondage by the demons of the world (power, money, entertainment, revenge, etc.), although they may not be as dramatic as in the case of Sarah, and when we have the nuptial relation with Jesus by receiving Communion in a state of mortal sin, we kill our soul.
