### Day #194 Here Am I send me

The people of Israel are in a very poor spiritual state, the Lord has done everything possible for them – he freed them from slavery, brought them forth defeated many nations, finally they entered the promised land – a fertile land – but still did not produce good fruit, they betrayed God and rejected His love. The prophet Isiah receives this word in such beautiful poetic form with such great symbolism.
Let me sing for my beloved
my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. Is 5:1,2
Now Isiah is called to go preach to the lost people of Israel. Isiah was given a beautiful vision of heaven.
I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. 2 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3 And one called to another and said:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. 5 And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” Is 6: 1-5
God is so holy that even the angels fear looking directly at God. The Seraphs covered the feet and their eyes because even they did not feel worthy to look at God or to stand in the holy of holies.
Now Isiah feels unworthy to even see that holy image, he is like Peter(When Jesus did the Miracle of the large fish catch) who said “I am unworthy please depart from me”. Even we should come to that realization when we sing the "Holy Holy Holy" at the consecration during Mass, for we are standing in the presence of Jesus. The host truly becomes the body and blood of Christ. The prayer before communion that we pray should come from this understanding of our worthlessness. “Lord I am not worthy to receive but on say the word and my soul shall be healed”
We are purified like Isiah when the host touches our tongues, at the final commission at the end of Mass, we should respond as Isiah did. “Here am I send me”
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
