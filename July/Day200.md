### Day #200 Love your enemies not because they deserve it, but because you deserve to be a child of God.

We read something shocking in today‚Äôs readings, God calls Egypt and Assyria His own, wait a minute ‚Äì Egypt was the one who held the Israelite's captives and Assyria are the enemies of Israel, both these nations are sinful, do nasty things and worship false gods. Why would God call these terrible nations His handiwork and his people?
‚ÄúBlessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.‚Äù
This may sound like a crazy thing for God to say, but even though they are evil nations they are the creation of the Lord and God knows how to bring them back, God knows how to change their hearts.
The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, ‚ÄúBlessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.‚Äù Is 19:22-25
God has a plan and knows that someday these evil nations will be able to respond to God‚Äôs love. We can find it very hard to see good in the people who hurt us or who are away from God. It can be frustrating to see them succussed despite the evil they are doing or the bad things they did to us. We can quickly write them off and say there is no hope for this person, they are an utter failure and God will punish them.
Let us try to be better Christians but praying and hoping for these people, hope against hope that God will change them. Jesus taught us to love our enemies, bless them, and pray for them. We will be called children of God if we do this, we should not curse our enemies like the world does but bless them because we know better, not because they deserve it but because we deserve to be children of God. Hopefully, our good example will help them change.
‚Äúbless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.‚Äù Lk 6:28
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòLove your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. Mat 5: 44-48
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
