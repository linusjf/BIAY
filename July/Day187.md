### Day #187 Praying for more time to live

King Hezekiah was on his death bed when he prayed for more time. The Lord gave him 15 more years of life, but did he make it count. He absolutely failed with those 15 more years, we can recall how he exposed the secrets of the Kingdom of Israel in yesterday‚Äôs readings. He also was filled with a lot of pride, considering all the possessions as his own rather than the Lord‚Äôs. He also had a son Manasseh in those last 15 years, who turned out to be one of the worst kings.
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, ‚ÄúIn Jerusalem I will put my name.‚Äù He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. 2 Kings 2:21
The deeds of Manasseh are even unimaginable ‚Äì sacrificing his own son to pagan gods.
Sometimes when we push our way with the Lord, God accepts our request and gives us another chance. We need to make the most of it rather than do more evil. When we pray for more time to live or for healing or for a problem to resolve, we should remember to become better persons after the prayer is answered.
We see many people praying prayers like ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will donate $100 to a charity‚Äù these prayers are more of a bribe. Or should we pray prayers like ‚Äì ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will give up this evil habit‚Äù No the correct way to pray is ‚ÄúLord I will give up this evil habit whether you heal me or not because it draws me away from you". Let us become better children of God every time we receive a blessing from Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
