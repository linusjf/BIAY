### Day #197 A Kingdom of Peace

As we read Isaiah today let us try to picture it, try to picture a wolf and a lamb at peace, the child and the snake playing together.
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. 7 The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 8 The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder’s den. 9 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Is 11:6-9
The Kingdom that Jesus established is a kingdom of peace, that’s what heaven is – there is no heat or sweat, pain or death, we will be in the presence of God and everything is at peace. Jesus is the Prince of peace and His kingdom is a Kingdom of peace. So should we wait for heaven to experience this peace? we could wait but God does not want us to be desperate, worried, or anxious in this earthly life – as we pray in the "Our Father"– “Thy Kingdom come” we should pray for a peaceful life on earth. Jesus wants us to have peace, that is why when he met the worried disciples in the upper room Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit on them and said “Peace be with you”.
Let us pray for peace in our world, among nations, among families, among friends, and for a resolution of differences, so that the whole world will be at peace. “May the Kingdom of Peace Come, May thy will be done”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
