### Day #197 A Kingdom of Peace

As we read Isaiah today let us try to picture it, try to picture a wolf and a lamb at peace, the child and the snake playing together.
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. 7 The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 8 The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder’s den. 9 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Is 11:6-9
The Kingdom that Jesus established is a kingdom of peace, that’s what heaven is – there is no heat or sweat, pain or death, we will be in the presence of God and everything is at peace. Jesus is the Prince of peace and His kingdom is a Kingdom of peace. So should we wait for heaven to experience this peace? we could wait but God does not want us to be desperate, worried, or anxious in this earthly life – as we pray in the "Our Father"– “Thy Kingdom come” we should pray for a peaceful life on earth. Jesus wants us to have peace, that is why when he met the worried disciples in the upper room Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit on them and said “Peace be with you”.
Let us pray for peace in our world, among nations, among families, among friends, and for a resolution of differences, so that the whole world will be at peace. “May the Kingdom of Peace Come, May thy will be done”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 11:1
Isaiah saw the house of David cut down like a tree and only the stump remaining. If the roots are alive, the stump will grow new shoots.

God had earlier warned the people that those who didn't bear fruit would be cut out of God’s Kingdom, just as a fruitless tree is felled with an axe and eventually perishes (Isaiah 10:33-34) and since most of David's descendants did not obey God's Word, they perished.

David’s descendants ruled Israel for some centuries until Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians and the last king Zedekiah was taken captive by them.  Thereafter everyone thought it was the end of the Davidic kingdom.

But what the people didn’t know was that all the descendants of David did not perish.  God had preserved some of them along with the others in exile and as God had prophesied (Isaiah 10:21-22) the remnant eventually returned to Israel.

The stump which Isaiah saw in the vision, was the remnant of David’s descendants and through them was born Mary, who was the Mother of Jesus by flesh (Romans 1:3), and Joseph, who was the father of Jesus by the law (Matthew 1:24-25).

Isaiah 11:2-5
According to this prophecy, the promised Messiah would possess all the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit:
Wisdom, understanding, spirit of counsel, (spiritual) strength, knowledge, fear of the Lord and piety (righteousness and faithfulness).

They are the same godly gifts which we all receive when we are baptized.
They are the same godly gifts which stay with us during our lifetime when we obey God’s commandments and walk in the way of the Lord.

Isaiah 11:6-10
Isaiah saw an image of a new creation being restored in the future, a creation which will be just like the Garden of Eden when there was peace and harmony between all creation, between humans (Adam & Eve) and animals (domestic and wild) and no one was hurt, a time when no one destroyed another life, whether for food or for revenge, a time when the domestic and the wild animals all grazed together and fed on green plants (Genesis 1:30).

\*For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.\*
When these prophecies were given, the number of people who believed in the God of Abraham was exceedingly small. The vast majority of people were polytheists, and the world was covered in pagan darkness.

Today, however, the situation is very different. Half of the human race worships the God of Abraham (Muslims, Jews and Christians) and virtually everyone has heard of him. By comparison to the days of the prophets, the world is now covered by the knowledge of the Lord the way the waters cover the sea.

This did not happen by accident. It was part of God’s plan.
It also did not happen apart from Jesus of Nazareth. It was through him that the nations came to worship the God of Abraham.

\*His dwelling shall be glorious.\*
“Dwelling” or “Tabernacle” is “the place on earth where God dwells with His people” as it was in the Garden of Eden.
In the old Covenant Tabernacle, God dwelt with His people only in His divinity.
In the new Covenant Temple (the Church), the Tabernacle is more glorious than in the old Covenant because Jesus dwells with His people with His Body, Blood, Soul and divinity, and will do so until the end of time (Matthew 28:20) in the form of consecrated bread (Communion).
