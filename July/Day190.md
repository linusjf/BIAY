### Day #190 Lack of Wisdom can lead to our downfall

Wisdom was the first thing that was created even before the heavens and the earth was created. Wisdom is so critical, that the lack of it can lead to our downfall. We need to constantly attune to wisdom, and ask the Holy Spirit to lead us ‚Äì for Wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. Happy is the one who is led by the Holy Spirit, who carefully listens to the voice of God.
‚ÄúAnd now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord; but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death.‚Äù Prov 8:32-34
We see the example of King Josiah ‚Äì who is this good King who is instrumental in celebrating Passover like never before.
‚ÄúNo Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Judah has kept such a Passover‚Äù 2 Ch 35:18
Even though he was such a good King he failed to listen to wisdom, to God. Now Pharaoh Neco was at war and King Josiah went out against him.
But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, ‚ÄúWhat have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you.‚Äù But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, ‚ÄúTake me away, for I am badly wounded.‚Äù So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 2 Ch 35:21-24
What a tragic mistake, If only King Josiah would have listened to the warning that God gave him. Judah would have had a good king for years to come. Another lesson to learn is the Lord can use your enemies to speak to you, we notice that Pharaoh Neco was the one who spoke God‚Äôs instruction. We need to have open ears to listen to the voice of God.
Let us try to attune our hearts to the Holy Spirit, and make every attempt to hear the voice of God. Have an open ear, always trying to listen to God ‚Äì God can use even our enemies to speak to us, we can hear his instruction from the place we least expect it. Just try to listen and he will speak. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
