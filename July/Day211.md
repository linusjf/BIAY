### Day #211 I have called you by name, you are mine.

We are precious in God’s eyes, each one of us has been called by name. We belong to God, we are His. God created and formed us, knit us together in our mother’s wombs. God loves us so much that He will give nations in exchange for us. When we go through tough times, we will not be overwhelmed. He will redeem us, we need not fear.
But now thus says the Lord, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you. 4 Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life. 5 Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you; Is 43:1-5
We sometimes think that we decide to pray or go to church, but the desire for prayer is initiated by God. We need to realize that, God choose us first and knew us even before we knew ourselves.
16 You did not choose me but I chose you. John 15:16
Even before the prodigal son decided to come back home, the father was waiting every day for his return, Even before the lost sheep was found, the good shepherd went out to find him. In the same way even before we pray, God is initiating us and calling us. God knows us through and through, even before a word in on our lips He already knows it.
Even before a word is on my tongue, O Lord, you know it completely. Ps 139:4
Let us totally rely on God because it is he who called us, choose us, and knows everything about us. He will be with us when we go through troubles, the waters will not drown us or the fires burn us. We will not be overwhelmed but redeemed by God Himself.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 44:28
\*Thus says the Lord your Redeemer of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd, and he shall carry out all my purpose”; and of Jerusalem, “It shall be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.”\*

Isaiah prophesied that king Cyrus would carry out God’s Will to rebuild the Temple, about 150 years before Cyrus was even born.

God plans everything for us too in advance but we destroy God’s plans for us by disobeying God and walking with the evil one.
