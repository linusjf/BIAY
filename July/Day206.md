### Day #206 Praying for our leaders

When we read Baruch we get a sense of desperation of the people of Israel, who are in exile and unable to go to the temple to offer sacrifice. This can be related to those times during the Pandemic when all churches were closed and we could not go to Mass. Now the people gather some money to send temple priest who could pray on their behalf and offer sacrifices. The stunning piece is that they are requesting prayers for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon who has literally kept them in exile.
10 They said: Here we send you money; so buy with the money burnt offerings and sin offerings and incense, and prepare a grain offering, and offer them on the altar of the Lord our God; 11 and pray for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and for the life of his son Belshazzar, so that their days on earth may be like the days of heaven.
We are called to pray for our rulers, our bosses, our superiors, congressmen, and all governing and political leaders.
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. 1 Tim 2:1-3
We see Paul urging us to pray for our leaders and in the below verse, we are encouraged to be good citizens.
All of you must obey the government rulers. No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule. And no one rules now without that power from God. 2 So if anyone is against the government, he is really against what God has commanded. And so he brings punishment on himself. 3 Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers. But people who do wrong must fear them. Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers? Then do what is right, and the ruler will praise you. 4 He is God‚Äôs servant to help you. But if you do wrong, then be afraid. The ruler has the power to punish; he is God‚Äôs servant to punish those who do wrong. 5 So you must obey the government. You must obey not only because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.
6 And this is also why you pay taxes. Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work. 7 Pay everyone, then, what you owe him. If you owe any kind of tax, pay it. Show respect and honor to them all. Rom 13:1-7
We should be good citizens, follow the law and pay our taxes. Everyone needs prayers, especially our leaders. We should pray for them to have good understanding and that they make policies that are just to all. We should pray for our leaders, whether we like them or not. We should pray that their hearts will be open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
