### Day #210 Evangelization is not optional

The prophet Ezekiel has this great vision of God in all his glory. After the vision, Ezekiel is commissioned to go out and proclaim the word of God. He is asked to eat the scroll with God‚Äôs word and he is now the mouthpiece of the Lord. He has no option but to proclaim the message that he was entrusted with. He is made a watchman of the house of Israel.
‚ÄúSon of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 18 If I say to the wicked, ‚ÄòYou shall surely die,‚Äô and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. 20 Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life.‚Äù Ez 3 17-21
We read all the scenarios above in detail, Ezekiel‚Äôs job is to proclaim God‚Äôs word if he fails to do that the blood of the wicked man would be on Ezekiel. Again there may be different ways that people may respond for God gave everyone free will. But it is our duty to proclaim God‚Äôs love, saving grace and judgement on the world. God does not want to condemn the world but to save it.
If you were asked to go out and speak to others about God, you may feel insecure or hesitant. But God reminds us in Isaiah that we should not fear, for God is with us he is our help and strength.
‚ÄúYou are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off‚Äù; 10 do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand. Is 41:9,10
The above verse is worth memorizing it gives us strength when said in times of fear and doubt.
Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 15 Now, I will make of you a threshing sledge, sharp, new, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff. 16 You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. Isaiah 41:14-16
We will be made strong and will become like a threshing sledge that will crush mountains and hills into chaff that the wind will carry away. God will make us strong and we will triumph over every situation. Our duty is to proclaim and speak to people, God will be with us and the response is up to them. Evangelization is not an optional calling but mandatory for every Christian, if not the blood of the wicked will be on our hands.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 210 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Isaiah 42:6-7
\*I am the Lord; I have called you in righteousness; I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.\*

God gave the old Israel to the world as a Covenant / mediator and as a light to the nations, to make Him known and to bring the world to Him.  He wanted them to open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, to release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and to be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

This prophecy was fulfilled in the Upper Room when Jesus instituted the Lord‚Äôs Supper and gave us His living Body, in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to receive Him as the Covenant between God and man, a Covenant between flesh and Spirit, a Covenant between human and divine, a Covenant between corruptible and incorruptible.  Through the sacraments Jesus would open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, He would release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and He would  be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins (Luke 4:18-21).
As followers of Christ we must continue bringing people close to Christ by being a light to the world through love and generosity.

Ezekiel 2:1-5
Ezekiel lived around 587 BC, around the time when Solomon's Temple was destroyed. Ezekiel was a priest in the Temple. God commanded him to go and prophesy to the people of Israel and to warn them about the forthcoming destruction of the Temple if they didn't turn from their evil ways.  By commanding Ezekiel to prophesy to a nation of rebellious people, God was commissioning him to be rejected.

Ezekiel was a shadow of Jesus.  Jesus too received a similar response from majority of the Israelites, but that didn‚Äôt stop Him from preaching to the people.

The Church too has a similar mission.
When we share the Word of God with the world, we should not expect that all will accept Christ, but that should not discourage us or stop us from sharing the Word of God.
When a farmer sows seeds it is not necessary that all will fall on rich soil (Matthew 13:8).
Let us, therefore, be on the sharing side of the Word, not on the rejecting side.

Ezekiel 3:18-19
\*‚ÄúIf I say to the wicked, ‚ÄòYou shall surely die,‚Äô and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.‚Äù\*
\*‚ÄúIf you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life.‚Äù\*

When God makes us aware that someone is committing a sin and we don't correct them or stop them, then we too are guilty of sin along with them.
But if we try to correct or stop someone from sinning and they refuse to correct themselves then they will be condemned but we will be without guilt for that particular sin.

In the new Covenant, a priest saves his own soul whenever he retains the sins of an unrepentant sinner by judiciously denying absolution as a warning (John 20:23).
