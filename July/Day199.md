### Day #199 The good Christian life

The Israelites have seen terrible days they had their land invaded, there were exiled, they were plundered, they saw poverty, and they saw days of starvation where the locust destroyed all crops. Once they went through the hard times they are able to appreciate the good things better, and they are able to be more thankful and grateful.
So you shall know that I, the Lord your God, dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
In that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water;
fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and water the Wadi Shittim. Joel 3:17,18
So it is with our lives, that we sometimes need to go through really tough times in order to be grateful and thankful for the good things that we have. The important thing as a Christian is to be close to God, always in the presence of the Lord, away from sin and wickedness, just like a branch cannot survive away from the vine, we should always be attached to the true Vine - Jesus. We should receive nourishment from the Vine, and eat His body and blood, the true spiritual food. Then even if we have problems or difficulties, we will be peaceful and joyful, because the Lord is on our side and we know that He is in control. We will receive the peace that surpasses understanding and joy that is beyond happiness. We will experience the good Christian life where the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
