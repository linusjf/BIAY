### Day #204 Are we just going through the motions

We read the stern warning in Isiah where the people honored God with their lips but their hearts were far from the Lord.

The Lord says:
‚ÄúThese people come near to me with their mouth
and honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship of me
is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
Is 29:13

We need to always have a close check on our prayer life, sometimes we can get complacent and focused on the outward aspects of our prayer life without actually praying. We could be reading our Bible but not even applying it to our lives. We could be praying our prayers but not meaning them. We could be just doing charity because it‚Äôs a good thing to do but do not see Jesus in the poor.
When we pray we should remember that it‚Äôs a conversation with God, that we should not just state all our petitions and run away, but sit and listen to God as well. We should not just pray for our earthly lives, but for our souls as well. We can sometimes start off well but slowly lose sight of our relationship with the Lord. We may be saying prayers with our lips but our mind is somewhere else. Let‚Äôs try to come back to the heart of worship, it should not be about the choir or the homily, it should be about God and me ‚Äì our relationship. Like the song of Solomon, we should be deeply in love with God ‚Äì where we cannot wait to meet each other.
We are called to seek the Lord with all our hearts, mind, and strength. Remember that God is seeking us first and loving us first. We should love him with everything we have not just our lips but from our hearts.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. Mark 12:13
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
