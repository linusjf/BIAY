### Day #198 I will pour out my spirit on all flesh

The book of Joel is just 3 chapters long; however, it is power packed with so many things. Joel is a minor prophet, minor means smaller book not smaller prophet. He is preaching straight to our heart, he starts the book with instructions to teach a life lesson to all generations. The life lesson is that God is for us, loves us, and is jealous for us. A lesson that God has been doing good to us from the start, giving us everything we need, however, we turn away from God and go our own way. God wants us more than we know, God does not want us to suffer but with a heavy heart may need to send suffering our way just so that we can turn back to God.
Yet even now, says the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; rend your hearts and not your clothing. Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing. Joel 2:12,13
We are called to repent from our evil ways, not just act like we are repentant but truly repent. We are called to rend our hearts and not our garments, to truly turn back to the Lord. We are called to not only feel sorry for what we did but to change our ways as well.
‚ÄúThe fruit of true repentance is a changed life‚Äù ‚Äì Michael Eltham üòú
If we truly repent, then God will pour out the Holy Spirit on us. In the Old Testament, only the prophets would receive the Holy Spirit, however, we have this promise that a time will come(Pentecost) when God‚Äôs Spirit will be poured on everyone. Not just the kings and prophets but the young men and the old men, the free and the slaves. We don‚Äôt have to be rich or poor, weak or strong, the only requirement is true repentance.
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit. Joel 2:28,29
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
