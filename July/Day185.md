### BIAY Day 185 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 19:9-36
When the king of Assyria threatened to attack Judah, King Hezekiah was very disturbed.

King Hezekiah was very devoted to the Lord and therefore whenever he was in fear or distress he immediately went to the Temple and prayed to the Lord.  Inspite of having his royal advisors he wanted the eternal divine perspective on the situation and the path forward for him. He didn't want to look at things from the limited human perspective and worry about them as they appeared to him.  He therefore didn't go to his advisors to ask for advice.  He wanted to see things as God saw them.  He went to the Temple to remind himself of who is really in control and who alone can truly help him.  And God showed him a vision of how, in the past, with His power God had delivered His people from their enemies who were even stronger than the king of Assyria.  Thereafter King Hezekiah put himself in that picture as a victorious king.

King Hezekiah's prayer is a great example for us to follow. He did not pray to God for self-preservation or for the preservation of his people and the Temple. He prayed to God to make their small kingdom victorious over the powerful nation so that God's name could be glorified in the world. Thus, by glorifying God's name in the world, salvation would come to the world.

When we are in fear or in distress, let us depend on God to make His power known to the world.  Let us not place our trust in our wealth or in humans.
Let us focus on the salvation of the world and not just on the salvation of ourselves, our families and our communities.

Psalm 143:8-10
*Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust.*
*Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.*
*Save me, O Lord, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.*
*Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.*
*Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.*

If we spend time with the Lord in the morning, He will deliver us from our enemies/evil, He will teach us to do His Will through the day and He will send His good Spirit to lead us.

Jesus also prayed in the early hours of the morning.

### Day #185 How to approach God when we have an impossible situation on hand

After a lot of bad Kings, we see Hezekiah, a somewhat good king of Judah. Hezekiah has this impossible situation on hand because Sennacherib the king of Assyria who defeated all the bigger nations in the area is now planning to attack this little nation and they send a letter mocking Israel‚Äôs faith in God. When Hezekiah received the letter, he responded by going to the House of the Lord, he spread out the letter in front of the Lord and prayed and asked the Lord for His intervention in this seemingly impossible task at hand. He then summoned the remnant from the North, remember they had not come to Jerusalem to worship due to the divided kingdom. Now many people came to the temple from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Judah to celebrate the feast of Passover. Those gathered just wanted to pray and worship God. Praying together was so good that after 7 days of community prayer, they wanted to pray for 7 more days. May we be blessed with this spirit of perseverance in prayer.
This is such an incredible way to approach God when we have tough decisions to make or impossible tasks at hand. Just go to the House of the Lord and spread out/surrender the problem/ situation. Seek God‚Äôs guidance and intervention in the situation. Also, another lesson to learn here is to seek the community‚Äôs prayer ‚Äì we see that most of Israel come together to pray. We are not meant to live this Christian life alone.
We are the body of Christ; one member cannot say it does not need the other just like a leg cannot say I do not need the hand. We are one body in Christ and if one member suffers the whole body suffers. Let us share our problems with the local Church community and seek their prayers and support. Also, the Local Church community is not alone, we are all part of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church on earth is not alone, for we are connected to the Church Suffering and the Church Triumphant. The Church militant is the Catholic Church on earth, the Church suffering is the Church in purgatory and the Church Triumphant are all those who made it to heaven, the saints. We the Church ‚Äì militant, suffering, and triumphant are all the body of Christ and He is the head. There is nothing to fear and we can never be alone, for we have a great church ‚Äì a large multitude and an even greater God who knows everything about us and already has our prayers in the works. He is moving forward ‚Äì before us working things out for us. Let us not forget to request the church to pray for our intentions, and not fear because God cares for us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 185 By Sheila

KINGS: The siege of Jerusalem describes a Second Attack on Judah after a lapse of time, the fact that Sennacherib was reconquering them. Assyrian Conquerors often led captives by means of hooks in their noses (2 Kings Verse 28)
The Mercy Seat: Inspite of Sennacherib's threat, Hezekiah prayed to the One who dwells between the Cherubim.
YOU ARE GOD, YOU ALONE. Of all the Kingdoms of the earth, Heaven and earth is Yours. Incline and hear the words of Sennacherib to reproach The Living God.

Isaiah's Prophecy: Although Assyria would occupy the Land and reap it's crop, Judah would not be entirely destroyed. Like a plant that lies dormant, Judah would appear conquered but would again bear fruit. Sennacherib's death is a fulfillment of Prophecy.
CHRONICLES: Hezekiah and all Israel and Judah celebrated the Passover Feast. The celebration of Passover, thus recalling the escape from Egypt, The escape especially from the hand of the Kings of Assyria and where there is sin, repentance and restoration may also be found. (Chronicles 30:6-9).
PSALM: "CRY OUT" For a favourable hearing from God or forgiveness in order that HE would not be overwhelmed with HIS Judgment.

Let us pray and know that none is righteous before GOD.
