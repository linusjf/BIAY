### Day #186 The danger of sharing your problems with everyone

In the day and age of social media and high tech, posts and tweets can reach a really large audience. The ease at which you can reach an audience has its positives and negatives. Almost everyone has their cell phone always with them, people post stuff anytime and in different mindsets/emotional states. We need to be very careful about our privacy settings and the content that we post, if we post all our problems on social media, we run the risk of exposing ourselves to people who could use that information to exploit us in the future or to take advantage of us. So always pray before you post anything and be very cautious about what you post.
In today’s readings, we see this pretty good King Hezekiah make a mistake by showing everything to the Babylonians. It’s worth reading the whole story.
At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.” He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord: Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 2 Kings 20:12-19
Hezekiah’s mistake will cause the whole nation to suffer and the Babylonians will carry away all of their positions and even his sons will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Let us learn a lesson from Hezekiah, let us be wise in what we post on social media. Also we should be wise with what we share with our friends and colleagues. Also what we share with our pastor or counselors, just telling them stuff is different from making a confession. Nothing shared in the sacrament of confession will be shared outside because the sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." Be careful when you are sharing stuff with a prayer partner or a group leader be careful about what you share. Share what is necessary and let the Holy Spirit guide you.
Let us not be like King Hezekiah who showed everything and brought disaster to Israel. Let us be controlled in what we post and say.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 186 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 20:6
King Hezekiah was mortally ill (2 Kings 20:1) but God extended his life by 15 years because of Hezekiah’s righteousness (obedience) and because he repented (2 Kings 20:3).  Thus by extending Hezekiah’s life God gave him another chance and during the next fifteen years God blessed Hezekiah with a son who would be his successor to the Davidic throne.

But instead of being thankful and giving glory to God for his extended life, Hezekiah's heart was filled with pride and he started boasting about his achievements and treasures to strangers (the Babylonians) who later attacked his country to grab those same treasures, which may have been out of greed or envy.

There may have been some time in our life when we thought it was going to be our end due to some serious illness or a calamity, etc., but we miraculously survived.  If God says that we will die soon because of our sins, He could change His plan and extend our lives if we repented, just as He did with Nineveh (Jonah 3:10), or He could be giving us a chance to repent after we recover, and the illness or calamity, etc. may have been a warning.

In such situations we must remember that God does not extend our life for us to enjoy it and waste it by continuing in our sinful ways.  God will extend our life because He wants our life to be part of His divine plan, which was disrupted because of our sins.  Therefore, after we overcome the illness or calamity, etc., we must ensure to repent and ask God to help us know His Will for us.

Of course, if we still ignore God’s Will or refuse to repent after we recover, God will definitely find another way to accomplish His divine plan, but if He has given us a second chance, we would be foolish to ignore His blessing and we would be walking towards our eternal destruction.

On the other hand, if we have led a life that is holy in God’s eyes, and we have survived a serious illness or a calamity, etc., then it may have been either for our spiritual healing or because God has a special mission for us.

Let us also be careful about what and how much information we share about our personal & private lives with others.  Boasting is an act of the devil therefore we do not know which of our listeners it will cause to burn with envy, greed or revenge.
