### Day #186 The danger of sharing your problems with everyone.

In the day and age of social media and high tech, posts and tweets can reach a really large audience. The ease at which you can reach an audience has its positives and negatives. Almost everyone has their cell phone always with them, people post stuff anytime and in different mindsets/emotional states. We need to be very careful about our privacy settings and the content that we post, if we post all our problems on social media, we run the risk of exposing ourselves to people who could use that information to exploit us in the future or to take advantage of us. So always pray before you post anything and be very cautious about what you post.
In today‚Äôs readings, we see this pretty good King Hezekiah make a mistake by showing everything to the Babylonians. It‚Äôs worth reading the whole story.
At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, ‚ÄúWhat did these men say? From where did they come to you?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have come from a far country, from Babylon.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhat have they seen in your house?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.‚Äù
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‚ÄúHear the word of the Lord: Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.‚Äù 2 Kings 20:12-19
Hezekiah‚Äôs mistake will cause the whole nation to suffer and the Babylonians will carry away all of their positions and even his sons will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Let us learn a lesson from Hezekiah, let us be wise in what we post on social media. Also we should be wise with what we share with our friends and colleagues. Also what we share with our pastor or counselors, just telling them stuff is different from making a confession. Nothing shared in the sacrament of confession will be shared outside because the sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." Be careful when you are sharing stuff with a prayer partner or a group leader be careful about what you share. Share what is necessary and let the Holy Spirit guide you.
Let us not be like King Hezekiah who showed everything and brought disaster to Israel. Let us be controlled in what we post and say.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
