### Day #207 The Lord will strengthen the weak hands and firm the feeble knees

To an exiled people these words would have been as sweet as honey.
Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, ‚ÄúBe strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.‚Äù
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. Is 35:3-6
Jesus fulfilled this promise, the widow and the orphan are cared for the blind receive their sight. The ears of the dead are opened, and the lame are leaping for joy like a deer. The mute tongue is now open, and they cannot stop praising God.
Let this word of God speak to us today even as we may feel exiled living in this world, which is full of people who are not interested in God. Most people in the world today are very self-satisfied and self-obsessed, just trying to gratify their own needs without even thinking of prayer. Jesus and matters of faith seem far from this generation, God is removed from schools and institutions. A generation of darkness seems to be evolving.
If we Christians feel like a weak minority, we can rest assured that Jesus will strengthen our feeble hands and firm our frail knees. My dear brother and sister who pray outside an Abortion center ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe strong and do not fear Here is your God‚Äù
Let us pray that the eyes of those who promote evil be opened. Let us pray that the tongue of the oppressed be loosed so they can speak. Let the ears of those who ignore God's voice be opened. Let us be prepared for the day of the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
