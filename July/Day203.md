### Day #203 Trust and Joy in the Midst of Trouble

It is easy to Praise God when everything is going well, it could be easy to thank God for all the blessings that we have. However, when we are going through a difficult time we tend to focus on the problem and forget to thank God. We tend to make prayers of petition and make novenas or fasts for a quick resolve. All this is good but let us not forget to thank the Lord with Joy and with Trust.

Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and no fruit is on the vines;
though the produce of the olive fails,
and the fields yield no food;
though the flock is cut off from the fold,
and there is no herd in the stalls,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
GOD, the Lord, is my strength;
he makes my feet like the feet of a deer,
and makes me tread upon the heights Hab 3:17-19

In Habakkuk, we see that they have nothing to be thankful for, no produce or flock ‚Äì seems like a famine. Even though they are going through the most difficult time ‚Äì yet they rejoice in the Lord. This should be our attitude as well, pray with Trust and rejoice in all situations, especially when things are not going our way. As Christians, we should not try to run away from suffering, but a journey with it rejoicing.

yet I will rejoice in the LORD

When the apostle Paul was in prison, he wrote the letter to the Philippians. In this letter, he writes that he is rejoicing in the Lord ‚Äú I rejoiced greatly in the Lord‚Äù Ph 4:10 and we have the very famous verse as well. ‚ÄúI can do all this through him who gives me strength.‚Äù Ph 4:13. He even exhorts us to do the same.
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Ph 4:4
We see more encouragement to always rejoice and pray without ceasing in Thessalonians. We are to rejoice even in our difficulties and pray and thank God in everything. For even the difficulties are a blessing to make us holy.

"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 1 Th 5:16-18

While Paul and Silas were in prison they did not feel sad and sit in a corner, they prayed and sang and rejoiced. Great things happen when we are in prayer and have joy in our hearts.

About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone‚Äôs chains were unfastened. Act 16:25,26

When we pray and sing, there are angels around us and great breakthroughs will happen. If you are going through something now, I encourage you to pray and sing and rejoice ‚Äì the Lord will set you free.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
