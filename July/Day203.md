### Day #203 Trust and Joy in the Midst of Trouble

It is easy to Praise God when everything is going well, it could be easy to thank God for all the blessings that we have. However, when we are going through a difficult time we tend to focus on the problem and forget to thank God. We tend to make prayers of petition and make novenas or fasts for a quick resolve. All this is good but let us not forget to thank the Lord with Joy and with Trust.

Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and no fruit is on the vines;
though the produce of the olive fails,
and the fields yield no food;
though the flock is cut off from the fold,
and there is no herd in the stalls,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
GOD, the Lord, is my strength;
he makes my feet like the feet of a deer,
and makes me tread upon the heights Hab 3:17-19

In Habakkuk, we see that they have nothing to be thankful for, no produce or flock ‚Äì seems like a famine. Even though they are going through the most difficult time ‚Äì yet they rejoice in the Lord. This should be our attitude as well, pray with Trust and rejoice in all situations, especially when things are not going our way. As Christians, we should not try to run away from suffering, but a journey with it rejoicing.

yet I will rejoice in the LORD

When the apostle Paul was in prison, he wrote the letter to the Philippians. In this letter, he writes that he is rejoicing in the Lord ‚Äú I rejoiced greatly in the Lord‚Äù Ph 4:10 and we have the very famous verse as well. ‚ÄúI can do all this through him who gives me strength.‚Äù Ph 4:13. He even exhorts us to do the same.
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Ph 4:4
We see more encouragement to always rejoice and pray without ceasing in Thessalonians. We are to rejoice even in our difficulties and pray and thank God in everything. For even the difficulties are a blessing to make us holy.

"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 1 Th 5:16-18

While Paul and Silas were in prison they did not feel sad and sit in a corner, they prayed and sang and rejoiced. Great things happen when we are in prayer and have joy in our hearts.

About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone‚Äôs chains were unfastened. Act 16:25,26

When we pray and sing, there are angels around us and great breakthroughs will happen. If you are going through something now, I encourage you to pray and sing and rejoice ‚Äì the Lord will set you free.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 25:6-10
\*On this mountain the Lord of hosts will provide for all peoples a feast of rich food and choice (well-aged) wines, juicy rich food and pure choice wines.  On this mountain He will destroy the veil that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever.  Then the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.\*

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, in the Upper Room on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, by giving us, through His apostles/bishops (Luke 22:19-20), the rich food of His Body and the choice wine of His Blood in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to save us from eternal death.

On the same mountain Jesus destroyed death by shedding His Blood and dying on the Cross.

There will be no more tears because through the sacraments Jesus would give His people His grace and strength to live the new law of love and overcome sufferings.  Thus the people would rejoice in their sufferings instead of pitying themselves (Matthew 5:11-12; Acts 5:41; Acts 16:25).

When Jesus died on the Cross, the veil (Temple curtain) was torn in two, indicating that the barrier between God and humanity was removed.  Now all people (Jews and gentiles) can worship God in His new Temple (the Church).

\*For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trodden down as straw is trodden down in the mire.\*

The Moabites were the descendants of Moab, who was one of the sons of Abraham‚Äôs nephew (Lot), and Moab was born of an illicit relation.  The Moabites eventually became the ultimate enemies of Israel, the descendants of Abraham.  The Moabites represent the enemy (Satan) of God‚Äôs people (Jews and Christians).
‚ÄúMoab‚Äù is one of the names used as a symbol of any and all nations that stand against God and Israel (old and new).

Isaiah 26:9-10
\*My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you.  For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.\*
\*If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the Lord.\*

Why does God allow evil on the earth?
God allows evil on the earth because He wants to draw some good out of it and also to humble us because of free will and due to the weakness of our souls.

When times are good we keep ourselves so busy with worldly matters that we don't find time to spend with God, and we make excuses even if we have time. Thus we end up going far from God.

God does not force us to follow Him, but He wants everyone to be saved.  He desires us more than we desire Him.  When we push God out of our lives the evil one gets a foothold in our lives and starts showering us with sufferings.  When these sufferings become unbearable and times are bad for us due to the absence of God in our lives, we automatically run to God for help with our own free will, like the helpless prodigal son (Luke 15:14-18), knowing that our souls have become bankrupt.

It is only when we are humbled through sufferings that we realize our dependency on God because apart from Christ we can do nothing (John 15:5).
