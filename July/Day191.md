### Day #191 Sometimes we may need to hit rock bottom to come to our senses

The Lord led the people out of slavery and defeated the army of Pharoah – with a lot of Miracles and wonders. God led the people of Israel out into the wilderness – leading them by fire by night and smoke by day – gave them leaders like Moses, Joshua, and many judges and Kings. The Lord gave them bread from heaven and provided them with everything they needed on their journey to the promised land. The Lord fought for them and defeated all nations they encountered and finally, they were given this promised land – a land flowing with milk and honey. The Lord also gave them the most important thing – a beautiful temple to worship – built by King Solomon. Instead of living the good life – they turned away from God to idolatry, were misled by the Kings, and the Israelite tribes fought against each other and were divided. Finally, they are Exiled to Babylon – the temple is being looted and all the silver and gold are taken away as spoil.
Sometimes we need to hit rock bottom in our lives to truly appreciate the love of God. We take things for granted and assume that everything will go well with us – we just ignore God and our relationship with him.
We are like the prodigal son who asks for his share of the property and does not want to have anything to do with the father. We are like Israelites who entered the promised land but forgot God. Just like the Prodigal son lost all his money and had to work at a pigsty or the like the Israelites who were taken prisoners by the Babylonians and the promised land plundered, with only the poor people left behind. We may experience great loss in our lives – but this is not God wanting to take revenge. It’s God’s invitation to come back to him – to run to the arms of the father – to rebuild the temple in the promised land.
Maybe it’s time where someone like King Cyrus will proclaim that “It’s time to go back and rebuild the house of the Lord” that "Your life will be restored"
“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him! Let him go up.” 2 Ch 36:23
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 191 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Chronicles 36:14-23
Due to the people’s disobedience to God’s commandments and desecration of the Temple, God allowed their enemy (the Chaldeans) to conquer Israel, slaughter many and take the survivors into exile until they completed their punishment period, that is, 70 years.   Although God had left them He did not abandon them.  He promised to take them back to their land (Israel) after the completion of 70 years.  At the end of the 70 years God announced the fulfillment of his prophecy by stirring up the heart of a pagan king (Cyrus) and gave the Jews some hope for the future.

Physical exile was meant to teach the people how mortal sins cause us to be spiritually exiled from God.  Mortal sins open the door to the devil thus bringing in suffering and misery.  Only repentance and obedience to God can take us back to Him.
Exile was like prison for Israel.  When they completed their sentence they would be released.
