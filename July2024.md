### Israel Falls to Assyria

[![Israel Falls to Assyria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day183.jpg)](https://youtu.be/15U03S2_D6g "Israel Falls to Assyria")

### Day #183 God permits suffering when we stray from Him, only so that it may cause us to return to the straight path.

Most parents must have corrected the kids this way “Clean your room or else no Ice cream tonight”. This is called reward-based training, something that we even follow when we train a puppy. And when the kids make mistakes, they are grounded or their toys are taken away until they learn a lesson.
The Israelites needed some tough love from the Lord, because of their continuous sins, their rebellion, and stiff-neckedness.
Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.” They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence. 2 Kings 17:13,14, 18,19
The Lord after giving them numerous chances, and sending many prophets with warning messages finally just lifted His hedge from the Israelites and they were exposed to their enemies. The whole of Israelites is now away from the presence of the Lord.
This is the case sometimes with us as well, we are so pigheaded that we just want to have our way with everything. We just want to continue in our sin and gratify our cravings, give in to temptations, and just do not want to listen to God and do not want to follow His teachings. The Lord is patient, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, however, He is a good parent as well. He will not spare the rod and spoil the kid, God will allow some suffering which will possibly cause us to think of our father’s house, like the prodigal son and we would possibly return home. Let us return to the arms of the Father.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 183 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 17:5-9 & 24

\*Then the king of Assyria occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years.  The king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.  This came about because the Israelites sinned against the LORD, their God by adopting unlawful practices and worshipping idols like the pagan nations around them.\*

The king of Assyria scattered the Israelites all over the surrounding pagan nations, then brought 5 pagan nations to inhabit Samaria so that the pagans could have mixed marriages with the Israelites, with the intention that the Israelites would lose their bloodline, their culture, their religion, and their allegiance to their king, thus preventing the possibility of future rebellion.  These mixed descendants came to be known as the Samaritans.

After being scattered because of their sins, if the Israelites would have repented and turned back to God, then even if they had married the pagans they would have been able to bring all their pagan spouses and in-laws to God and the ten tribes would not have been lost.

Like the Israelites, we too are called to be holy.  We must live our lives like Christ did.  When we have mixed marriages, one of the ways we can evangelize our non-Christian spouses and in-laws is by living our Christian life faithfully so that we can bring them to Christ.  But when we start living our lives like the non-Christians to please our spouses and in-laws, then, like those 10 tribes of Israel, our Christian community too will start diminishing.

Micah 5:2-3

\*But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.\*

This was the text which led the magi to Jerusalem to look for the Messiah, but they didn't find Him in the palace. And when King Herod enquired about it his priests knew what was already prophesied through Micah.

God chose a small insignificant town for His Son to be born, and through the womb of an even more insignificant woman.

God uses less to do more. God uses something negligible to do something large.
We don't have to be famous or popular for God to use us for His divine mission. We don't even have to be experts or perfect in anything. He will use our mistakes to teach us. He only wants our "yes" for Him to start using us.

\*Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.\*

God would hand over His people to their enemies until the time the Messiah would come into the world and deliver them from slavery.

Thus, when Jesus came to earth, Israel was physically under the oppression of the Romans because of their sins but Jesus gave them hope for liberation from spiritual slavery (forgiveness of sins) for those who accepted Him.

Micah  6:7-8
\*Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”\*

Micah was referring to the king of Moab who offered his first born son and defeat was turned to victory. Therefore the demon-inspired people around Israel were trapping themselves into all kinds of infernal powers and thus tempted the people of God to look elsewhere for their own source of power (2 Kings 3:27).

\*He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\*

God has already told us what He wants us to do to receive eternal life but, like those Israelites, we too choose to go our own way.  God is not asking us to perform any Herculean task; all that He wants from us is to be just, kind and humble and obey His commandments.

### DAY 183: By Sheila

KINGS: In the 12Year of King Ahaz, Hoshea reigns Samaria for 9Years. Shalmanesar attacked, settled the territory and carried away the Israelites to Assyrian Cities.
Israel's Sins: Hence began Intermarriages, the worship of idols, violation of God's Law and improper Worship of God.
MICAH: The City Jerusalem would suffer seige because of its sins. The Birth Place of the Shepherd King would be Bethlehem. By predicting a New King from Bethlehem, Micah was invoking the Covenant God made with David Centuries later, at the Birth of Jesus, where the Wise Men question, concerning where the Christ was to be born.
Judah's Kings were insecure as strength, to assure lasting peace for God's Chosen People. JESUS, The Great King Of Israel is Our Only Peace.
God would not stop with only Redeeming a remnant of Israel, theirs would be the Presence of God's people, would be to the Nation's like Life-Giving Water. The Prophet Micah revealed, they would also be like a 'lion' among the Gentiles as St. Paul describes the Church in 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.
God has a legal court case then for violation of the Covenant. He called the Hills and Mountains, who had witnessed Israel's transgressions to hear the case.
What had God done to deserve rejection of His Covenant? Had HE not Supernaturally redeemed them from slavery in Egypt?
God reminded them of events during their Wilderness Journey that revealed His Righteousness and Power.
God's people gave no explanation to His Question. God connected His people through Micah by demanding Justice, Mercy and Obedience, qualities lacking in Judah.
Messages of 8th Century Prophets: Amos called for Justice. Hosea kindness. Isaiah to obey and to walk humbly with God. Micah stated boldly that only God could right such wrong. He encouraged through suffering in Judgment was certain, it was also temporary. Micah prayed for protection too.
Psalm: The Psalmist  expressed in confidence that only God can deliver from the power of evil men and punish the evil-doers.
Let's put our confidence in faith that GOD is our Deliverer.

### Hezekiah Reigns

[![Hezekiah Reigns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day184.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L0kfDab7d2c "Hezekiah Reigns")

### Day #184 Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord

This Psalm makes for such a good prayer, that we can pray every morning.
Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds Ps 141:3,4
Many people are hurt by words, it is said that words hurt harder than punches. Words have power and they can either build up a person or tear down. Most people can remember the good and bad things that were said to them, some even remember the words they heard as children. We need to be very careful about what we say, and how we say it. The words we speak can bring destruction and cause discouragement, especially to our kids and anyone under us at work, and even our family and friends.
The mouth speaks what the heart is full of and it's very easy to speak hurtful words when we are angry or upset. Words once spoken are like a bullet fired, they cannot be taken back. We are called to tame the tongue, by practicing self-control.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one’s life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. James 3:3-6
Beautiful examples like the bits in the horse’s mouth, the rudder, and the ship, and the spark and the forest should help us realize that a small word spoken out of hate can cause a relationship to be set on fire, or a ship to sink, if we lose control of our tongue we will lose control of the whole body – like the bits in the horse’s mouth.
Let us pray and ask the Lord to guard our mouths, and keep watch on our lips.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Hezekiah's Prayer

[![Hezekiah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day185.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ykiLZLMDkMY "Hezekiah's Prayer")

### BIAY Day 185 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 19:9-36
When the king of Assyria threatened to attack Judah, King Hezekiah was very disturbed.

King Hezekiah was very devoted to the Lord and therefore whenever he was in fear or distress he immediately went to the Temple and prayed to the Lord.  Inspite of having his royal advisors he wanted the eternal divine perspective on the situation and the path forward for him. He didn't want to look at things from the limited human perspective and worry about them as they appeared to him.  He therefore didn't go to his advisors to ask for advice.  He wanted to see things as God saw them.  He went to the Temple to remind himself of who is really in control and who alone can truly help him.  And God showed him a vision of how, in the past, with His power God had delivered His people from their enemies who were even stronger than the king of Assyria.  Thereafter King Hezekiah put himself in that picture as a victorious king.

King Hezekiah's prayer is a great example for us to follow. He did not pray to God for self-preservation or for the preservation of his people and the Temple. He prayed to God to make their small kingdom victorious over the powerful nation so that God's name could be glorified in the world. Thus, by glorifying God's name in the world, salvation would come to the world.

When we are in fear or in distress, let us depend on God to make His power known to the world.  Let us not place our trust in our wealth or in humans.
Let us focus on the salvation of the world and not just on the salvation of ourselves, our families and our communities.

Psalm 143:8-10
*Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust.*
*Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.*
*Save me, O Lord, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.*
*Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.*
*Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.*

If we spend time with the Lord in the morning, He will deliver us from our enemies/evil, He will teach us to do His Will through the day and He will send His good Spirit to lead us.

Jesus also prayed in the early hours of the morning.

### Day #185 How to approach God when we have an impossible situation on hand.

After a lot of bad Kings, we see Hezekiah, a somewhat good king of Judah. Hezekiah has this impossible situation on hand because Sennacherib the king of Assyria who defeated all the bigger nations in the area is now planning to attack this little nation and they send a letter mocking Israel’s faith in God. When Hezekiah received the letter, he responded by going to the House of the Lord, he spread out the letter in front of the Lord and prayed and asked the Lord for His intervention in this seemingly impossible task at hand. He then summoned the remnant from the North, remember they had not come to Jerusalem to worship due to the divided kingdom. Now many people came to the temple from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Judah to celebrate the feast of Passover. Those gathered just wanted to pray and worship God. Praying together was so good that after 7 days of community prayer, they wanted to pray for 7 more days. May we be blessed with this spirit of perseverance in prayer.
This is such an incredible way to approach God when we have tough decisions to make or impossible tasks at hand. Just go to the House of the Lord and spread out/surrender the problem/ situation. Seek God’s guidance and intervention in the situation. Also, another lesson to learn here is to seek the community’s prayer – we see that most of Israel come together to pray. We are not meant to live this Christian life alone.
We are the body of Christ; one member cannot say it does not need the other just like a leg cannot say I do not need the hand. We are one body in Christ and if one member suffers the whole body suffers. Let us share our problems with the local Church community and seek their prayers and support. Also, the Local Church community is not alone, we are all part of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church on earth is not alone, for we are connected to the Church Suffering and the Church Triumphant. The Church militant is the Catholic Church on earth, the Church suffering is the Church in purgatory and the Church Triumphant are all those who made it to heaven, the saints. We the Church – militant, suffering, and triumphant are all the body of Christ and He is the head. There is nothing to fear and we can never be alone, for we have a great church – a large multitude and an even greater God who knows everything about us and already has our prayers in the works. He is moving forward – before us working things out for us. Let us not forget to request the church to pray for our intentions, and not fear because God cares for us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### DAY 185 By Sheila

KINGS: The siege of Jerusalem describes a Second Attack on Judah after a lapse of time, the fact that Sennacherib was reconquering them. Assyrian Conquerors often led captives by means of hooks in their noses (2 Kings Verse 28)
The Mercy Seat: Inspite of Sennacherib's threat, Hezekiah prayed to the One who dwells between the Cherubim.
YOU ARE GOD, YOU ALONE. Of all the Kingdoms of the earth, Heaven and earth is Yours. Incline and hear the words of Sennacherib to reproach The Living God.

Isaiah's Prophecy: Although Assyria would occupy the Land and reap it's crop, Judah would not be entirely destroyed. Like a plant that lies dormant, Judah would appear conquered but would again bear fruit. Sennacherib's death is a fulfillment of Prophecy.
CHRONICLES: Hezekiah and all Israel and Judah celebrated the Passover Feast. The celebration of Passover, thus recalling the escape from Egypt, The escape especially from the hand of the Kings of Assyria and where there is sin, repentance and restoration may also be found. (Chronicles 30:6-9).
PSALM: "CRY OUT" For a favourable hearing from God or forgiveness in order that HE would not be overwhelmed with HIS Judgment.

Let us pray and know that none is righteous before GOD.

### Struggles with Self-Interest

[![Struggles with Self-Interest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day186.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XaJcTFlVvBU "Struggles with Self-Interest")

### Day #186 The danger of sharing your problems with everyone.

In the day and age of social media and high tech, posts and tweets can reach a really large audience. The ease at which you can reach an audience has its positives and negatives. Almost everyone has their cell phone always with them, people post stuff anytime and in different mindsets/emotional states. We need to be very careful about our privacy settings and the content that we post, if we post all our problems on social media, we run the risk of exposing ourselves to people who could use that information to exploit us in the future or to take advantage of us. So always pray before you post anything and be very cautious about what you post.
In today’s readings, we see this pretty good King Hezekiah make a mistake by showing everything to the Babylonians. It’s worth reading the whole story.
At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?” Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a far country, from Babylon.” He said, “What have they seen in your house?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.”
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord: Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” 2 Kings 20:12-19
Hezekiah’s mistake will cause the whole nation to suffer and the Babylonians will carry away all of their positions and even his sons will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Let us learn a lesson from Hezekiah, let us be wise in what we post on social media. Also we should be wise with what we share with our friends and colleagues. Also what we share with our pastor or counselors, just telling them stuff is different from making a confession. Nothing shared in the sacrament of confession will be shared outside because the sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." Be careful when you are sharing stuff with a prayer partner or a group leader be careful about what you share. Share what is necessary and let the Holy Spirit guide you.
Let us not be like King Hezekiah who showed everything and brought disaster to Israel. Let us be controlled in what we post and say.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 186 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 20:6
King Hezekiah was mortally ill (2 Kings 20:1) but God extended his life by 15 years because of Hezekiah’s righteousness (obedience) and because he repented (2 Kings 20:3).  Thus by extending Hezekiah’s life God gave him another chance and during the next fifteen years God blessed Hezekiah with a son who would be his successor to the Davidic throne.

But instead of being thankful and giving glory to God for his extended life, Hezekiah's heart was filled with pride and he started boasting about his achievements and treasures to strangers (the Babylonians) who later attacked his country to grab those same treasures, which may have been out of greed or envy.

There may have been some time in our life when we thought it was going to be our end due to some serious illness or a calamity, etc., but we miraculously survived.  If God says that we will die soon because of our sins, He could change His plan and extend our lives if we repented, just as He did with Nineveh (Jonah 3:10), or He could be giving us a chance to repent after we recover, and the illness or calamity, etc. may have been a warning.

In such situations we must remember that God does not extend our life for us to enjoy it and waste it by continuing in our sinful ways.  God will extend our life because He wants our life to be part of His divine plan, which was disrupted because of our sins.  Therefore, after we overcome the illness or calamity, etc., we must ensure to repent and ask God to help us know His Will for us.

Of course, if we still ignore God’s Will or refuse to repent after we recover, God will definitely find another way to accomplish His divine plan, but if He has given us a second chance, we would be foolish to ignore His blessing and we would be walking towards our eternal destruction.

On the other hand, if we have led a life that is holy in God’s eyes, and we have survived a serious illness or a calamity, etc., then it may have been either for our spiritual healing or because God has a special mission for us.

Let us also be careful about what and how much information we share about our personal & private lives with others.  Boasting is an act of the devil therefore we do not know which of our listeners it will cause to burn with envy, greed or revenge.

### Praying for Time

[![Praying for Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day187.jpg)](https://youtu.be/INb2hRyPxqE "Praying for Time")

### Day #187 Praying for more time to live

King Hezekiah was on his death bed when he prayed for more time. The Lord gave him 15 more years of life, but did he make it count. He absolutely failed with those 15 more years, we can recall how he exposed the secrets of the Kingdom of Israel in yesterday’s readings. He also was filled with a lot of pride, considering all the possessions as his own rather than the Lord’s. He also had a son Manasseh in those last 15 years, who turned out to be one of the worst kings.
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, “In Jerusalem I will put my name.” He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. 2 Kings 2:21
The deeds of Manasseh are even unimaginable – sacrificing his own son to pagan gods.
Sometimes when we push our way with the Lord, God accepts our request and gives us another chance. We need to make the most of it rather than do more evil. When we pray for more time to live or for healing or for a problem to resolve, we should remember to become better persons after the prayer is answered.
We see many people praying prayers like “God if you heal me, I will donate $100 to a charity” these prayers are more of a bribe. Or should we pray prayers like – “God if you heal me, I will give up this evil habit” No the correct way to pray is “Lord I will give up this evil habit whether you heal me or not because it draws me away from you". Let us become better children of God every time we receive a blessing from Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Book of the Law

[![The Book of the Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day188.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rP44kIbiNBc "The Book of the Law")

### Day #188 Avoid the near occasion of sin.

In today’s proverb, we can find some good advice about living a chaste life. The example given is about a young man who seems to have gone the wrong way. The author of the proverb looks out of the window of his house and notices a senseless young man among the simple. This youth seems to be walking the streets and looking for this woman. This woman is not a harlot, but a married woman dressed like a harlot. The woman’s husband has gone on a long journey, and she seems to be on every street corner trying to seduce the youth.
Now no one knows if this story is true or not, but the takeaway for us should be the warning. The young man needs to be careful about the path he takes, for he may take a path that has trapped many and led them to hell. Let us read this warning for ourselves and be warned.
With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. Prov 7: 22-27
Now, this can be taken literally and is very relevant to our generation, where there are so many extramarital relationships. I assume that most of us reading this do not struggle with the sin of marital fidelity, we can apply this to any sin. The devil is a roaring lion roaming everywhere, trying to find someone to devour. We have to be careful not to entertain sin too much or the near occasion of sin, lest the devil will afflict us/devour us.
Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. 1 Pet 5:8
We also need to guard ourselves against our flesh, for if we do not be careful, we can easily fall into sin.
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.” Gen 4:7
This warning was given to Cain, we should also heed it and master our flesh and sin.
Let us be watchful in prayer and avoid the near occasion of sin. Sin can arise from the world, the flesh, or the devil, let us be aware and vigilant and heed the warning of the author of the proverb.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Follow the Lord

[![Follow the Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day189.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Gt_un7ZivbE "Follow the Lord")

### Day #189 Wisdom is better than gold

If you were asked to choose between a large amount of money and God, what would you pick?
Would you be satisfied with all the wealth and comforts this world can offer? I don’t think that perfect health, wealth, beauty, stuff, or people can ever satisfy us, if it was so then all the rich people would be happy all the healthy people would be joyful, and all the beautiful people would feel whole.
We all are created to be loved by God and only in Him will we be complete.
Now the path to the whole life/holy life is what prepares us to be complete/whole/satisfied/fulfilled. It is the journey that shapes us like a diamond that needs to be chiseled and polished to shine its best, we are being formed in our spiritual lives every day, through every challenge/situation/difficulty/sickness/God’s word/God experience.
One reason for us not growing in our spiritual lives could be “we love sin too much”. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, we need to be able to hate our sin, rather than take pleasure in it – it’s easier said than done – because our flesh is drawn towards gratifying ourselves.
We need to seek wisdom more than we seek things of this world, we need to make an effort to learn from the Lord. Seek instruction rather than silver and knowledge rather than gold. We should dwell in prudence and find knowledge in discretion.
However, all this knowledge should be governed by wisdom and a willing spirit.
Knowledge is knowing stuff, but wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge and a willing spirit is what helps us to do the things we are called to. – Michael Eltham 🤣
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength. Pr 8:10-14
When we seek wisdom we will have counsel, insight, and strength to do the will of the Lord
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 189 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 23:1-25
Hilkiah found the Book of the Law (2 Kings 22:8), Shaphan read it to King Josiah (2 Kings 22:10) and a great spiritual revival took place in the whole country.  All idols (Baal, Asherah, Molech, etc.) and evil practices were destroyed and people were restored back to God by renewing the Covenant.

We too are called to do the same.
Let us stop idolizing our jobs, money, positions, possessions, talents, etc.
Then let us renew our Covenant with God by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) and the Eucharist (Communion) regularly.
Let us reform ourselves first, and then reform the little community around us by reading the Word of God and sharing it with our families, friends and neighborhood.

2 Kings 23:29
Inspite of all the spiritual revival which Josiah brought about, in the end he made a mistake by taking his own decision, instead of consulting God, before deciding to go into battle, thus causing his own destruction.

Whenever there’s an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is always strong resistance from the demonic.
When things start going well for us and we are walking with the Lord, Satan steps in with flatteries and extra appreciation thus making us a little over-confident.  We gradually develop pride and end up in Satan’s team.  Satan does it so smoothly that we don’t even realize when and how we ended up walking with him.

Let us therefore be guided by God’s Word in all we do and say and apply it to our lives every day.  Let us not make the error of misusing God’s Word to fit our agenda.

### Judah is Overrun

[![Judah is Overrun](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day190.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tEhRzERfU8Q "Judah is Overrun")

### Day #190 Lack of Wisdom can lead to our downfall

Wisdom was the first thing that was created even before the heavens and the earth was created. Wisdom is so critical, that the lack of it can lead to our downfall. We need to constantly attune to wisdom, and ask the Holy Spirit to lead us – for Wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. Happy is the one who is led by the Holy Spirit, who carefully listens to the voice of God.
“And now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord; but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death.” Prov 8:32-34
We see the example of King Josiah – who is this good King who is instrumental in celebrating Passover like never before.
“No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Judah has kept such a Passover” 2 Ch 35:18
Even though he was such a good King he failed to listen to wisdom, to God. Now Pharaoh Neco was at war and King Josiah went out against him.
But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you.” But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly wounded.” So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 2 Ch 35:21-24
What a tragic mistake, If only King Josiah would have listened to the warning that God gave him. Judah would have had a good king for years to come. Another lesson to learn is the Lord can use your enemies to speak to you, we notice that Pharaoh Neco was the one who spoke God’s instruction. We need to have open ears to listen to the voice of God.
Let us try to attune our hearts to the Holy Spirit, and make every attempt to hear the voice of God. Have an open ear, always trying to listen to God – God can use even our enemies to speak to us, we can hear his instruction from the place we least expect it. Just try to listen and he will speak. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Babylonian Exile

[![The Babylonian Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day191.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k_JQWIxEQqw "The Babylonian Exile")

### Day #191 Sometimes we may need to hit rock bottom to come to our senses

The Lord led the people out of slavery and defeated the army of Pharoah – with a lot of Miracles and wonders. God led the people of Israel out into the wilderness – leading them by fire by night and smoke by day – gave them leaders like Moses, Joshua, and many judges and Kings. The Lord gave them bread from heaven and provided them with everything they needed on their journey to the promised land. The Lord fought for them and defeated all nations they encountered and finally, they were given this promised land – a land flowing with milk and honey. The Lord also gave them the most important thing – a beautiful temple to worship – built by King Solomon. Instead of living the good life – they turned away from God to idolatry, were misled by the Kings, and the Israelite tribes fought against each other and were divided. Finally, they are Exiled to Babylon – the temple is being looted and all the silver and gold are taken away as spoil.
Sometimes we need to hit rock bottom in our lives to truly appreciate the love of God. We take things for granted and assume that everything will go well with us – we just ignore God and our relationship with him.
We are like the prodigal son who asks for his share of the property and does not want to have anything to do with the father. We are like Israelites who entered the promised land but forgot God. Just like the Prodigal son lost all his money and had to work at a pigsty or the like the Israelites who were taken prisoners by the Babylonians and the promised land plundered, with only the poor people left behind. We may experience great loss in our lives – but this is not God wanting to take revenge. It’s God’s invitation to come back to him – to run to the arms of the father – to rebuild the temple in the promised land.
Maybe it’s time where someone like King Cyrus will proclaim that “It’s time to go back and rebuild the house of the Lord” that "Your life will be restored"
“Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him! Let him go up.” 2 Ch 36:23
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 191 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Chronicles 36:14-23
Due to the people’s disobedience to God’s commandments and desecration of the Temple, God allowed their enemy (the Chaldeans) to conquer Israel, slaughter many and take the survivors into exile until they completed their punishment period, that is, 70 years.   Although God had left them He did not abandon them.  He promised to take them back to their land (Israel) after the completion of 70 years.  At the end of the 70 years God announced the fulfillment of his prophecy by stirring up the heart of a pagan king (Cyrus) and gave the Jews some hope for the future.

Physical exile was meant to teach the people how mortal sins cause us to be spiritually exiled from God.  Mortal sins open the door to the devil thus bringing in suffering and misery.  Only repentance and obedience to God can take us back to Him.
Exile was like prison for Israel.  When they completed their sentence they would be released.

### The Prophet Isaiah

[![The Prophet Isaiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day192.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xEOlzZfroPg "The Prophet Isaiah")

### Day #192 Corporal works of Mercy – Bury the dead

In today’s reading of Tobit, we see that Tobit is almost risking his life to bury the dead. It can seem kind of unnecessary to us because the person is dead. But it’s an act of showing respect for life, all life comes from God and the soul returns to God. The Catholic Church recognizes that this as an important part of one’s faith and hence is part of the 7-corporal works of mercy, which are
Feed the Hungry
Give Drink to the Thirsty
Clothe the Naked
Shelter the Homeless
Visit the Sick
Visit the Imprisoned
Bury the Dead
Tobit was one zealous person doing this mercy work, he would steal the bodies and give them a good burial. Even though he received many warnings he did not stop. In one incidence he was about to have a feast – the food was spread out, and with the abundance of food he wanted to invite any of his people who may need a meal. His son found an Israelite strangled – Tobit left his feast meal to go and do this act of Mercy.
During the time of Covid, many heroic people risked their lives like Tobit to give the dead a proper burial. Let us cultivate this habit of showing concern towards the family who lost a loved one, by going to the funeral, sending the family a card/flowers, or better still offering a Mass for the soul of the dearly departed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 192 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 1:2-20
Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed during the time of Abraham, which was more than a thousand years before Isaiah was born. But although Isaiah was preaching to Jerusalem he referred to them as Sodom and Gomorrah.

The towns of Sodom and Gomorrah were blessed with flourishing prosperity, but the people squandered all their blessings by doing evil. Israel was doing the same.

The Israelites were the most blessed people on earth. They were the people to whom the Law of God was given, they had the wisdom of Solomon, and they had the Davidic kingdom of God but they squandered all their blessings on false gods, led immoral lives and ignored the Almighty God by ignoring His desire completely. They performed robotic rituals and ensured that they did everything that the Mosaic Law commanded, but they ignored the oppression and suffering of the widows and orphans whom they were supposed to care for like their own.
Eventually the children followed the example of the elders.

But Israel's story is our story.

Like them we too sometimes attend Mass like robots, we pray like robots, we observe all the prescribed festivals, etc. and we may be checking everything on the list, but we live unholy lives, we rarely go for Confession, we spend our money on false gods (entertainment, luxury goods, etc.),  and we ignore God's desire by ignoring the less fortunate ones around us.

God wants us to love Him by leading holy lives and caring for the less fortunate ones around us. Thus our physical life will reflect our spiritual life and will be a blessing to all around us.

Isaiah 2:2–5
Isaiah was shown a vision of a peaceful world in the future where all people would be walking towards the new Jerusalem (the Church).  A world where criminals would discard their weapons and take up agricultural tools; a world where there would be no war, but only peace because, through the sacraments, the Holy Spirit would empower the people to forgive their offenders and live the law of love.
This was God’s plan for the new earth after the Resurrection of Jesus.

Let us therefore live in obedience to God and walk in His light so that God can use us to bring Heaven down on earth.

### Day #193 Archangel Raphael (God heals)- healing of sight to Tobit

One way to remember the Archangels is as below
“The Archangel of light, sight, and fight – Archangel of light is Gabriel, sight is Raphael and fight is Michael “
We see a mention of Archangel Raphael in the book of Tobit,
At that very moment, the prayers of both of them were heard in the glorious presence of God. So Raphael was sent to heal both of them: Tobit, by removing the white films from his eyes, so that he might see God’s light with his eyes; and Sarah, daughter of Raguel, by giving her in marriage to Tobias son of Tobit, and by setting her free from the wicked demon Asmodeus. Tobit 3:16,17
We usually do not pay much attention to the presence of angels or their actions. Almost everything in our lives involves angles, we have a guardian angel always with us, when we pray, our prayers are carried by angels and presented to God. When God wants to bring us healing or work Miracles or do anything – Angels are dispatched with work orders. The angles are God’s army of workers, just doing the will of God. Raphael is one of the three Archangels – who is attributed to healing and deliverance. We see Raphael is instrumental in the healing of Tobit’s sight and deliverance of Raquel. The angel's name Raphael means “God heals”.
Although only the archangels Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name in the New Testament, the Gospel of John speaks of the pool at Bethesda, where many ill people rested, awaiting the moving of the water. "An angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under" John 5:1-4. Because of the healing powers often linked to Raphael, the angel spoken of is generally associated with St. Raphael, the Archangel.
Raphael is also attributed to “Happy meetings” because we read in Tobit that he made the meeting of Tobit and Sarah happen soon after Tobit received his sight back. Tobias was next in line - entitled to marry Sarah.
At the same time that Tobit returned from the courtyard into his house, Sarah daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.
We can always pray to St Raphael for our healing and for those seeking life partners.
O Raphael, lead us towards those we are waiting for, those who are waiting for us! Raphael, Angel of Happy Meetings, lead us by the hand towards those we are looking for! May all our movements, all their movements, be guided by your Light and transfigured by your Joy. Angel Guide of Tobias, lay the request we now address to you at the feet of Him on whose unveiled Face you are privileged to gaze. Lonely and tired, crushed by the separations and sorrows of earth, we feel the need of calling to you and of pleading for the protection of your wings, so that we may not be as strangers in the Province of Joy, all ignorant of the concerns of our country. Remember the weak, you who are strong--you whose home lies beyond the region of thunder, in a land that is always peaceful, always serene, and bright with the resplendent glory of God. Amen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Holy Is the Lord

[![Holy Is the Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day194.jpg)](https://youtu.be/weiDPkNuLs0 "Holy Is the Lord")

### Day #194 Here Am I send me

The people of Israel are in a very poor spiritual state, the Lord has done everything possible for them – he freed them from slavery, brought them forth defeated many nations, finally they entered the promised land – a fertile land – but still did not produce good fruit, they betrayed God and rejected His love. The prophet Isiah receives this word in such beautiful poetic form with such great symbolism.
Let me sing for my beloved
my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. Is 5:1,2
Now Isiah is called to go preach to the lost people of Israel. Isiah was given a beautiful vision of heaven.
I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. 2 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3 And one called to another and said:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.”
4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. 5 And I said: “Woe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” Is 6: 1-5
God is so holy that even the angels fear looking directly at God. The Seraphs covered the feet and their eyes because even they did not feel worthy to look at God or to stand in the holy of holies.
Now Isiah feels unworthy to even see that holy image, he is like Peter(When Jesus did the Miracle of the large fish catch) who said “I am unworthy please depart from me”. Even we should come to that realization when we sing the "Holy Holy Holy" at the consecration during Mass, for we are standing in the presence of Jesus. The host truly becomes the body and blood of Christ. The prayer before communion that we pray should come from this understanding of our worthlessness. “Lord I am not worthy to receive but on say the word and my soul shall be healed”
We are purified like Isiah when the host touches our tongues, at the final commission at the end of Mass, we should respond as Isiah did. “Here am I send me”
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here am I; send me!”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 194 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 5:1-7
Israel was God’s vineyard.
God gave the Israelites a hilly region filled with grape vines and fertile soil.
Then He cleared it of stones (the Amalekites) and gave them His chosen priests.
He then gave them a towering Temple but the Lord received sour grapes which were not fit to make wine.
The people broke the Covenant.

They did not observe the Sabbath, they offered incense to idols, and they rejected God.  Thus they separated themselves from God.  God, therefore, allowed them to be conquered by their enemies.

Let us check if we have been better than those Israelites.
If we have accepted Jesus then let us check if we are in Covenant with God at all times, or not.
Let us check whether we are observing Sunday Sabbath (the Lord’s day) and whether we are offering incense to the living God or to false gods (wealth, possessions, entertainment, etc.).

Isaiah 6:1-7
\*I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the hem of his robe filling the temple.  Seraphim were stationed above Him.\*
“Seraph” means “burning.”
The angels who have a spiritual fire around themselves are called “Seraphim angels (plural).”

\*One Seraph cried out to the other, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and earth are full of His glory."\*
During Mass, we join the angels and saints in glorifying God by singing this hymn which is their unending hymn of praise (Revelation 4:8).

\*At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.\*
The smoke was the indication of the presence of God in the Heavenly Temple (Exodus 40:34-38; 1 Kings 8:10-11).

\*Then I (Isaiah) said, “Woe is me, I am doomed, for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips, and yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”\*
Isaiah's words are recalled by the priests, every day during Mass, before reading the Gospel.  The Priest silently prays “Almighty God, cleanse my heart and my lips that I may worthily proclaim the Gospel."
Since no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20), Isaiah thought he was going to die because he had seen God.

Tobit 6:10-11
Sarah was held in bondage by a demon who was killing her husbands on the night of the marriage (also Tobit 7:1, 9-17; 8:4-9).

Like Sarah, we too may be held in bondage by the demons of the world (power, money, entertainment, revenge, etc.), although they may not be as dramatic as in the case of Sarah, and when we have the nuptial relation with Jesus by receiving Communion in a state of mortal sin, we kill our soul.

### Tobias and Sarah Pray

### Day #195 Physical intimacy is a sign and pledge of spiritual communion

We read about Tobias and Sarah’s beautiful example of keeping the marriage bed holy.
Sarah was possessed by a daemon and her previous 7 husbands were killed on the night of the marriage. But Tobias was unlike them, he was not driven by lust but had a good realization of the spiritual connection that spouses have and that God should be welcomed into every marital act by prayer.
Then Tobias remembered the words of Raphael, and he took the fish’s liver and heart out of the bag where he had them and put them on the embers of the incense. 3 The odor of the fish so repelled the demon that he fled to the remotest parts of Egypt. But Raphael followed him, and at once bound him there hand and foot.Tobit 8:2-3
How important it is to remember instruction and to follow the guidance given to us. Now the parents of Sarah had no hope, they even dug up a grave to bury Tobias.
When the parents had gone out and shut the door of the room, Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, “Sister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety.” 5 So she got up, and they began to pray and implore that they might be kept safe. Tobit 8:4,5
Praying as a couple is vital and very important, even praying before the marital act is a good practice that will keep lust at check. It is essential to keep the spouse’s well-being in mind, this will ensure one is not operating out of lust but out of love. Praying helps invite God into the union of husband and wife, as it is a spiritual union as well. When we invite God we have to be open to life – which rules out any forms of contraception(The Catholic Church encourages Natural family planning).
I recall this case where a couple was not able to conceive for many years, this was because they had used birth control when they didn’t want a child. After a good confession, they finally were able to conceive and bear a healthy baby. God needs to be welcome in the marital act, it is not a purely biological act – it is spiritual as well – as soul is created.
The below notes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church are beautiful.

2360. Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament.

2361. "Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not simply something biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until death." 143

2362. The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family.

The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and fecundity.
The clear takeaway is that the Marital act is a holy act that should help sanctify the marriage. It should be in a prayerful and joyful environment. Spouses should care for one another, look out for each other’s good and be open to life.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Destruction of Israel

[![Destruction of Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day196.jpg)](https://youtu.be/c98r3mpAbiw "Destruction of Israel")

### Day #196 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light

If you haven't seen one of those videos of a blind person seeing for the first time, you should - it's amazing. Imagine there is a power outage and we have no candles or generators or cell phones, we would eagerly wait for the power to come back on. because we don't like the dark.
The human race was in great darkness, the chosen nation Israel has abandoned God and are exiled, and there seems to be no light at the end of this tunnel. The Gentile nations are barbarous and worship false gods. These words of Isiah are of great importance as he is announcing the birth of Jesus our savior.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness— on them light has shined.
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Is 9:2,4,6
There is Hope, hope in the form of a child. One would expect a Mighty King with a great army, but God’s ways are not our ways. We are given a child, an innocent baby Jesus who will liberate us not by force but by love.
He will carry our burdens on His shoulders and break the bond of sin, once and for all.
He is the light of the world that has come into darkness. A very bright light has been turned on – we can see because of Jesus. We who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, we who were blind can now see.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 9:1-6

\*The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; Upon those who lived in a land of gloom a light has shone.\*
In the future, the people who suffered in exile would see Jesus, the light of the world.

\*For the yoke that burdened them, the pole on their shoulder, the rod of their taskmaster, you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.\*
The yoke of the old law with more than 613 Commandments would be made light with the new law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love and the power of the Holy Spirit through the sacraments.

“The day of Midian” is the day when God used the judge Gideon to deliver the northern territories from Midianite oppression (Judges chapters 6 & 7).

\*For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests.\*
\*They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.\*
\*His dominion is vast and will be forever peaceful, upon David’s throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever.\*
This Son would be the Messiah (Jesus) who would redeem the suffering people and re-establish the kingdom of David.

Isaiah 10:5-16
God allows evil because He wants to draw some good out of it.
Assyria was an evil superpower during the 8th century BC, and God would eventually punish them for their evil deeds. But before punishing them, and because they were evil, God was using them, like a carpenter uses a saw, to punish His people, the Israelites, for living in disobedience to His commandments. But the Assyrians, in their pride and arrogance, did not attribute their success to God. They thought they were winning wars because of their physical and material (weapon) strength and their intelligence.

Because of their pride and arrogance, the Assyrians lacked the humility to realize that God was using them in His plan for salvation.  Therefore they lost the chance to have a relationship with the Almighty God.

When our country is *threatened* by our neighbors, it is a *warning* for us from God that we are not leading our lives according to His Will and He is giving us a chance to repent, correct our errors and change our lives.
When our country is *attacked* by our neighbors, it is a *punishment* for us from God because we have not repented and corrected our errors inspite of His warnings.

Punishment is therapeutic.  It is meant to heal us spiritually.  But if we put our full faith and trust in our human strength (weapons) and in our human intelligence to protect ourselves, and we still don’t repent, then our destruction is inevitable.

The Holy Spirit who dwells within us from the time we are baptized, is greater than any worldly power which is dominated by evil spirits (1 John 4:4).

Therefore, if we are being attacked or threatened by any of our neighboring countries, we need to examine our conscience and our way of living and repent if we are guilty of sin.
Let us work hard to keep our souls purified at all times, and in every negative situation, let us put our faith and trust in God, and not in our human strength and intelligence.

Tobit 12:8
\*Prayer with fasting is good, but better than both is almsgiving with righteousness.\*
This does not mean almsgiving is more important than prayer & fasting. “Righteousness” means “living in total obedience to God” which also includes prayer & fasting. Therefore, there is no point in spending our time in prayer & fasting if we don't care about the poor and needy, and if we don't obey God completely.

### Woe and Consolation

### Day #197 A Kingdom of Peace

As we read Isaiah today let us try to picture it, try to picture a wolf and a lamb at peace, the child and the snake playing together.
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. 7 The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 8 The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder’s den. 9 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Is 11:6-9
The Kingdom that Jesus established is a kingdom of peace, that’s what heaven is – there is no heat or sweat, pain or death, we will be in the presence of God and everything is at peace. Jesus is the Prince of peace and His kingdom is a Kingdom of peace. So should we wait for heaven to experience this peace? we could wait but God does not want us to be desperate, worried, or anxious in this earthly life – as we pray in the "Our Father"– “Thy Kingdom come” we should pray for a peaceful life on earth. Jesus wants us to have peace, that is why when he met the worried disciples in the upper room Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit on them and said “Peace be with you”.
Let us pray for peace in our world, among nations, among families, among friends, and for a resolution of differences, so that the whole world will be at peace. “May the Kingdom of Peace Come, May thy will be done”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 197 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 11:1
Isaiah saw the house of David cut down like a tree and only the stump remaining. If the roots are alive, the stump will grow new shoots.

God had earlier warned the people that those who didn't bear fruit would be cut out of God’s Kingdom, just as a fruitless tree is felled with an axe and eventually perishes (Isaiah 10:33-34) and since most of David's descendants did not obey God's Word, they perished.

David’s descendants ruled Israel for some centuries until Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians and the last king Zedekiah was taken captive by them.  Thereafter everyone thought it was the end of the Davidic kingdom.

But what the people didn’t know was that all the descendants of David did not perish.  God had preserved some of them along with the others in exile and as God had prophesied (Isaiah 10:21-22) the remnant eventually returned to Israel.

The stump which Isaiah saw in the vision, was the remnant of David’s descendants and through them was born Mary, who was the Mother of Jesus by flesh (Romans 1:3), and Joseph, who was the father of Jesus by the law (Matthew 1:24-25).

Isaiah 11:2-5
According to this prophecy, the promised Messiah would possess all the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit:
Wisdom, understanding, spirit of counsel, (spiritual) strength, knowledge, fear of the Lord and piety (righteousness and faithfulness).

They are the same godly gifts which we all receive when we are baptized.
They are the same godly gifts which stay with us during our lifetime when we obey God’s commandments and walk in the way of the Lord.

Isaiah 11:6-10
Isaiah saw an image of a new creation being restored in the future, a creation which will be just like the Garden of Eden when there was peace and harmony between all creation, between humans (Adam & Eve) and animals (domestic and wild) and no one was hurt, a time when no one destroyed another life, whether for food or for revenge, a time when the domestic and the wild animals all grazed together and fed on green plants (Genesis 1:30).

\*For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.\*
When these prophecies were given, the number of people who believed in the God of Abraham was exceedingly small. The vast majority of people were polytheists, and the world was covered in pagan darkness.

Today, however, the situation is very different. Half of the human race worships the God of Abraham (Muslims, Jews and Christians) and virtually everyone has heard of him. By comparison to the days of the prophets, the world is now covered by the knowledge of the Lord the way the waters cover the sea.

This did not happen by accident. It was part of God’s plan.
It also did not happen apart from Jesus of Nazareth. It was through him that the nations came to worship the God of Abraham.

\*His dwelling shall be glorious.\*
“Dwelling” or “Tabernacle” is “the place on earth where God dwells with His people” as it was in the Garden of Eden.
In the old Covenant Tabernacle, God dwelt with His people only in His divinity.
In the new Covenant Temple (the Church), the Tabernacle is more glorious than in the old Covenant because Jesus dwells with His people with His Body, Blood, Soul and divinity, and will do so until the end of time (Matthew 28:20) in the form of consecrated bread (Communion).

### The Day of the Lord

[![The Day of the Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day198.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bgGJr5wmiLY "The Day of the Lord")

### Day #198 I will pour out my spirit on all flesh

The book of Joel is just 3 chapters long; however, it is power packed with so many things. Joel is a minor prophet, minor means smaller book not smaller prophet. He is preaching straight to our heart, he starts the book with instructions to teach a life lesson to all generations. The life lesson is that God is for us, loves us, and is jealous for us. A lesson that God has been doing good to us from the start, giving us everything we need, however, we turn away from God and go our own way. God wants us more than we know, God does not want us to suffer but with a heavy heart may need to send suffering our way just so that we can turn back to God.
Yet even now, says the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; rend your hearts and not your clothing. Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing. Joel 2:12,13
We are called to repent from our evil ways, not just act like we are repentant but truly repent. We are called to rend our hearts and not our garments, to truly turn back to the Lord. We are called to not only feel sorry for what we did but to change our ways as well.
“The fruit of true repentance is a changed life” – Michael Eltham 😜
If we truly repent, then God will pour out the Holy Spirit on us. In the Old Testament, only the prophets would receive the Holy Spirit, however, we have this promise that a time will come(Pentecost) when God’s Spirit will be poured on everyone. Not just the kings and prophets but the young men and the old men, the free and the slaves. We don’t have to be rich or poor, weak or strong, the only requirement is true repentance.
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit. Joel 2:28,29
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 198 By Cynthia Dsilva

Joel 2:30–31
\*“I will give portents in the heavens. . . . The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood.”\*

On the day of the Crucifixion of Jesus (probable date 3 April 33 AD), darkness had covered the land (Matthew 27:45) and the moon appeared red in color, due to a lunar eclipse.
God used the heavenly bodies to give us a sign, and not for us to practice astrology.

The Catholic Church too rejects the practice of astrology.

### 7 Verses Every Catholic Should Know - Dr. John Bergsma

### Times for War

[![Times for War](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day199.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_DFMjoNq8fQ "Times for War")

### Day #199 The good Christian life

The Israelites have seen terrible days they had their land invaded, there were exiled, they were plundered, they saw poverty, and they saw days of starvation where the locust destroyed all crops. Once they went through the hard times they are able to appreciate the good things better, and they are able to be more thankful and grateful.
So you shall know that I, the Lord your God, dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
In that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water;
fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and water the Wadi Shittim. Joel 3:17,18
So it is with our lives, that we sometimes need to go through really tough times in order to be grateful and thankful for the good things that we have. The important thing as a Christian is to be close to God, always in the presence of the Lord, away from sin and wickedness, just like a branch cannot survive away from the vine, we should always be attached to the true Vine - Jesus. We should receive nourishment from the Vine, and eat His body and blood, the true spiritual food. Then even if we have problems or difficulties, we will be peaceful and joyful, because the Lord is on our side and we know that He is in control. We will receive the peace that surpasses understanding and joy that is beyond happiness. We will experience the good Christian life where the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Egypt, Assyria and Israel

[![Egypt, Assyria and Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day200.jpg)](https://youtu.be/n0aaotRdvJE "Egypt, Assyria and Israel")

### Day #200 Love your enemies not because they deserve it, but because you deserve to be a child of God.

We read something shocking in today’s readings, God calls Egypt and Assyria His own, wait a minute – Egypt was the one who held the Israelite's captives and Assyria are the enemies of Israel, both these nations are sinful, do nasty things and worship false gods. Why would God call these terrible nations His handiwork and his people?
“Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.”
This may sound like a crazy thing for God to say, but even though they are evil nations they are the creation of the Lord and God knows how to bring them back, God knows how to change their hearts.
The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.” Is 19:22-25
God has a plan and knows that someday these evil nations will be able to respond to God’s love. We can find it very hard to see good in the people who hurt us or who are away from God. It can be frustrating to see them succussed despite the evil they are doing or the bad things they did to us. We can quickly write them off and say there is no hope for this person, they are an utter failure and God will punish them.
Let us try to be better Christians but praying and hoping for these people, hope against hope that God will change them. Jesus taught us to love our enemies, bless them, and pray for them. We will be called children of God if we do this, we should not curse our enemies like the world does but bless them because we know better, not because they deserve it but because we deserve to be children of God. Hopefully, our good example will help them change.
“bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.” Lk 6:28
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. Mat 5: 44-48
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Keys to the Kingdom

[![Keys to the Kingdom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day201.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pW46C2gV3tQ "Keys to the Kingdom")

### Day #201 Papacy – the father over the household (Prophesized in Isiah)

In order to understand the Papacy, we need to put on the lens of the Israeli Kingdom, not this 21st-century lens. The King was the supreme authority, but when he was going away, he would give all governing authority to the “al-habbayit” he would give him this big Key that he would literally carry on his shoulder. He would have the same authority as the king, along with authority he was also given the responsibility to be a father to the people. As we read the below verses we can read about the authority and the role of the al-habbayit/stewart/father over the household.
“In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. Is 22:20-25
This prophecy is fulfilled when Jesus instituted Peter as the first Pope(Papa/Father) the “al-habbayit”.
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Mat 16:18-20
The concept of the papacy is not something new that was introduced by the catholic church it’s seen back in Isiah. The al-habbayit who had the key which opened the gates of the kingdom and the treasury, he had the authority to bind and loose. The first pope Peter did this very role, we can see the evidence in the acts of the apostles and other letters – they would always consult Peter on doctrine. This did not end with Peter, it was handed down to Linus, and Clement (who are mentioned in the NT).
We can trace back – every single Pope, it’s not fiction it's history - you can find all of the 266 Popes listed here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes>
As we know Jesus did not give us a book, He gave us a Church. This authority was passed down even until this current day Pope. Although there have been bad Popes, there have been far more good ones. God who led Israel with good and bad leaders – continues to lead the Church with good and bad Pope. Even Peter was not faultless – remember he denied Jesus 3 times, but Jesus gave him a second chance and asked him if he loved him, and commissioned Peter to feed his lambs and tend his lambs. The Pope was given the keys to the kingdom to bind and lose, the church has used this authority to further explain the teachings of Jesus in the form of dogmas, canon law, teachings, catechism... A lot of inspired teachings from saints, fathers of the church, holy men, and women over the centuries are what shape and form the church teachings, they are all guided by the Holy Spirit.
Of course, the Pope does not just decide everything, there are councils and synods and various levels of prayerful discernment for something to become an official church teaching. A good example would be – If I gave you my car keys, you could drive wherever you like but if you try to sell my car, no one will buy it because it is registered in my name. The Pope cannot make changes just as he feels inspired, just because he has the key, there needs to be an agreement with the church and with heaven.
Let us love being part of the true flock of God, the flock that has the genuine al-habbayit, the father of the household, the Papa, the Pope.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 201 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 22:15-25
Shebna was a shadow of corrupt Popes / prime ministers / shepherds in God's Kingdom whereas Eliakim was a shadow of the God-fearing ones. It is the ministry of authority that holds the fort together, therefore if God is not happy with His earthly shepherds then He will ensure that they are replaced.
This was a foreshadow of the heavenly Davidic kingdom (the Church).

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom, the ungodly prime ministers (the popes) and chief ministers (the bishops) must be succeeded or replaced in the event of their death or removal from their offices, just as it was with the earthly Davidic kingdom.

Since there was no Davidic king ruling during the time of Jesus, and since Jesus was a descendant of David and the rightful heir to the throne, choosing 12 apostles for His Kingdom meant that Jesus was reviving the Davidic kingdom, so the apostles understood that the existing King Herod and his team would have to either step down or be overthrown.
This may have been the reason why the apostles asked Jesus as to "when He was going to restore the kingdom to Israel" (Acts 1:6) because, after His resurrection, Jesus had re-confirmed Simon's role as Prime Minister (John 21:15-17).  And, as the apostles rightly understood, that role was to be continued.

### God's Judgment

[![God's Judgment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day202.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xTpub0Fj9AY "God's Judgment")

### Day #202 “Unjust scales” and “Pride” are a recipe for disaster

We read the prophecy about Tyre, which was a very rich city. We see that Tyre is increasing in wealth, it’s the center of trade and there is a lot of money and wealth and buildings and towers. However, the city is becoming increasingly corrupt and the people who live in it are very proud and unjust. All this will end in the downfall of the city of Tyre
We also see a similar situation in Habakkuk, the prophet is calling out the injustice that is happening and the consequences that it will have.

“Woe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
setting his nest on high
to escape the clutches of ruin! Hab 2:9

“Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
and establishes a town by injustice! Hab 2:12

One thing that is clear is that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders are building in vail. If the house or city is based on evil means it will eventually collapse, when unjust measures are used the person/city/house may prosper for some time but will be ruined and not profit him much.

The LORD detests dishonest scales,
but accurate weights find favor with him.
When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
but with humility comes wisdom. Prov 11:1-2

The Lord detests the dishonest scales and those who make a profit from unjust dealings. Let us remember that all the money in the world cannot satisfy anyone, it will just leave them wanting more money/power/fame – only the humble will find satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Our country prints “IN GOD WE TRUST” on the currency, but do we trust in the Lord or in riches? This statement on the currency is very helpful to keep us focused on the true source of everything good – God himself.

Everything good comes from God. Every perfect gift is from him. James 1:17

Let us not use unjust scales or get proud when money accumulates, but in turn, humble ourselves and trust in the Lord for everything.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 202 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 24:5
*The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants, for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.*
Breaking a covenant was considered a serious crime and with their immorality, disobedience, rebellion and pride, mankind has broken the covenant which God had made with them, but God did not give mankind any severe punishment for their infidelity.  Instead, Jesus took upon himself the severe punishment which we deserved for breaking the covenant.

People have defiled the earth by breaking God’s laws and by violating the covenant which He made to last forever.  So God pronounced a curse on the earth.  Its people are paying for what they have done.

Habakkuk 1:2-3
*O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and thou wilt not hear?*
*Or cry to thee “Violence!” and thou wilt not save?*
*Why dost thou make me see wrongs and look upon trouble?*
*Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.*

The strife and discord we face in our own lives can sometimes cause us to wonder, as the prophet does, as to why God doesn’t seem to hear or intervene when we cry for help.
But let us not forget that God did not redeem us to abandon us in our trials, just as He did not redeem Israel from Egypt to let them die in the desert.   He will be with us all the way through till the end, just as He was with Israel.  He is our God and we are the people whom He shepherds always, though at times His mercy and justice seem long delayed.

In times of prolonged crisis we tend to think that God has abandoned us.
Unanswered prayers are one of those experiences which really put our faith to test.  If we are going through some trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. it is easy to start losing faith, despair and be tempted to ask “how long Lord?” or “where are you Lord?”

If our prayers have not been answered for a long time, let us not despair, for the Lord delays because He desires to do something greater for us than what we are asking for, while we are waiting in prayer, clinging to the Lord.  During this time God strengthens us spiritually.

One of the fruits of unanswered prayers is a deeper and more intense prayer.  God allows us to remain in the trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. because He wants us to grow spiritually.

We may be asking for temporal good to ease the suffering but God wants our spiritual good and therefore He delays in answering.

Habakkuk 2:2-3
Habakkuk was prophesying shortly before the Babylonians would conquer Israel. His message was one of “doom and gloom.” It was not a popular message.  God told him to write down his vision so that all could see it and prepare, or “so he may run who reads it…”  The idea was that if folks received his message and acted, they could be saved, for “the righteous shall live by his faith” as verse 4 says. It was a dark vision, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel for the faithful.
This is not a “write it and it’s yours” theology as many people believe.

Habakkuk 2:4
*Behold, he, whose soul is not upright in him, shall fail, but the righteous man shall live by his faith.*

Faith is not just about believing.  To have faith in God means to have belief as well as trust, and we can prove our trust in God by our works, that is, even when the world is against us.

### Rejoice in the Lord

[![Rejoice in the Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day203.jpg)](https://youtu.be/oeSIWzslIJA "Rejoice in the Lord")

### Day #203 Trust and Joy in the Midst of Trouble

It is easy to Praise God when everything is going well, it could be easy to thank God for all the blessings that we have. However, when we are going through a difficult time we tend to focus on the problem and forget to thank God. We tend to make prayers of petition and make novenas or fasts for a quick resolve. All this is good but let us not forget to thank the Lord with Joy and with Trust.

Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and no fruit is on the vines;
though the produce of the olive fails,
and the fields yield no food;
though the flock is cut off from the fold,
and there is no herd in the stalls,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
GOD, the Lord, is my strength;
he makes my feet like the feet of a deer,
and makes me tread upon the heights Hab 3:17-19

In Habakkuk, we see that they have nothing to be thankful for, no produce or flock – seems like a famine. Even though they are going through the most difficult time – yet they rejoice in the Lord. This should be our attitude as well, pray with Trust and rejoice in all situations, especially when things are not going our way. As Christians, we should not try to run away from suffering, but a journey with it rejoicing.

yet I will rejoice in the LORD

When the apostle Paul was in prison, he wrote the letter to the Philippians. In this letter, he writes that he is rejoicing in the Lord “ I rejoiced greatly in the Lord” Ph 4:10 and we have the very famous verse as well. “I can do all this through him who gives me strength.” Ph 4:13. He even exhorts us to do the same.
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Ph 4:4
We see more encouragement to always rejoice and pray without ceasing in Thessalonians. We are to rejoice even in our difficulties and pray and thank God in everything. For even the difficulties are a blessing to make us holy.

"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 1 Th 5:16-18

While Paul and Silas were in prison they did not feel sad and sit in a corner, they prayed and sang and rejoiced. Great things happen when we are in prayer and have joy in our hearts.

About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were unfastened. Act 16:25,26

When we pray and sing, there are angels around us and great breakthroughs will happen. If you are going through something now, I encourage you to pray and sing and rejoice – the Lord will set you free.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 203 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 25:6-10
\*On this mountain the Lord of hosts will provide for all peoples a feast of rich food and choice (well-aged) wines, juicy rich food and pure choice wines.  On this mountain He will destroy the veil that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever.  Then the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.\*

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, in the Upper Room on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, by giving us, through His apostles/bishops (Luke 22:19-20), the rich food of His Body and the choice wine of His Blood in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to save us from eternal death.

On the same mountain Jesus destroyed death by shedding His Blood and dying on the Cross.

There will be no more tears because through the sacraments Jesus would give His people His grace and strength to live the new law of love and overcome sufferings.  Thus the people would rejoice in their sufferings instead of pitying themselves (Matthew 5:11-12; Acts 5:41; Acts 16:25).

When Jesus died on the Cross, the veil (Temple curtain) was torn in two, indicating that the barrier between God and humanity was removed.  Now all people (Jews and gentiles) can worship God in His new Temple (the Church).

\*For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trodden down as straw is trodden down in the mire.\*

The Moabites were the descendants of Moab, who was one of the sons of Abraham’s nephew (Lot), and Moab was born of an illicit relation.  The Moabites eventually became the ultimate enemies of Israel, the descendants of Abraham.  The Moabites represent the enemy (Satan) of God’s people (Jews and Christians).
“Moab” is one of the names used as a symbol of any and all nations that stand against God and Israel (old and new).

Isaiah 26:9-10
\*My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you.  For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.\*
\*If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the Lord.\*

Why does God allow evil on the earth?
God allows evil on the earth because He wants to draw some good out of it and also to humble us because of free will and due to the weakness of our souls.

When times are good we keep ourselves so busy with worldly matters that we don't find time to spend with God, and we make excuses even if we have time. Thus we end up going far from God.

God does not force us to follow Him, but He wants everyone to be saved.  He desires us more than we desire Him.  When we push God out of our lives the evil one gets a foothold in our lives and starts showering us with sufferings.  When these sufferings become unbearable and times are bad for us due to the absence of God in our lives, we automatically run to God for help with our own free will, like the helpless prodigal son (Luke 15:14-18), knowing that our souls have become bankrupt.

It is only when we are humbled through sufferings that we realize our dependency on God because apart from Christ we can do nothing (John 15:5).

### Zephaniah's Warnings

[![Zephaniah's Warnings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day204.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kHlo6WKF6aU "Zephaniah's Warnings")

### Day #204 Are we just going through the motions

We read the stern warning in Isiah where the people honored God with their lips but their hearts were far from the Lord.

The Lord says:
“These people come near to me with their mouth
and honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship of me
is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
Is 29:13

We need to always have a close check on our prayer life, sometimes we can get complacent and focused on the outward aspects of our prayer life without actually praying. We could be reading our Bible but not even applying it to our lives. We could be praying our prayers but not meaning them. We could be just doing charity because it’s a good thing to do but do not see Jesus in the poor.
When we pray we should remember that it’s a conversation with God, that we should not just state all our petitions and run away, but sit and listen to God as well. We should not just pray for our earthly lives, but for our souls as well. We can sometimes start off well but slowly lose sight of our relationship with the Lord. We may be saying prayers with our lips but our mind is somewhere else. Let’s try to come back to the heart of worship, it should not be about the choir or the homily, it should be about God and me – our relationship. Like the song of Solomon, we should be deeply in love with God – where we cannot wait to meet each other.
We are called to seek the Lord with all our hearts, mind, and strength. Remember that God is seeking us first and loving us first. We should love him with everything we have not just our lips but from our hearts.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. Mark 12:13
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Promise to Zion

[![Promise to Zion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day205.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LNwSiVB0HX0 "Promise to Zion")

### Day #205 Fear not for God is in our midst

We know that the Israelites have been going through a rough spiritual journey and were exiled from the promised land. Imagine how fearful and shameful they must be, Zephaniah’s prophecy starts with woes but end with comfort and restoration. The restoration will happen through Jesus – Emmanuel God in our midst, he will strengthen the weak hands, he is the warrior that went into battle for us and came out victorious, love and forgiveness were his weapons.
He now rejoices over us in gladness and he renews us in his love, exults over us with loud singing

On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
Do not fear, O Zion;
do not let your hands grow weak.
The LORD, your God, is in your midst,
a warrior who gives victory;
he will rejoice over you with gladness,
he will renew you in his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing
as on a day of festival. Zep 3:16-18

When darkness encamps you and you feel like there is no one who cares for you, remember that God is in our midst, He is Jesus, who cares for us and rejoices over us. He is our warrior who is fighting for us and if God is on our side, who can be against us?

He leads us with gentle whispering like a good shepherd he leads us to green pastures.

Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” Is 30:21

He calls us by name and is pleased with us, Jesus loves us more than we can imagine.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 205 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 30:1-33 & 31:1-9
In times of trouble the Israelites put their trust in their ancient enemies, the Egyptians, instead of obeying and trusting in the Lord.
Pagan Egypt was a symbol of the evil world.

So often, in times of trouble, we too put our trust in the evil world who does not want to believe in or hear about the Lord, because we want our problems to be solved instantly and according to our plans and so we don't mind lying or we don't mind bribing our way through or using people to solve our problems illegally, because that is the normal way the world solves problems. We don't have the patience to wait for God to solve our problems because God's solutions always involve sufferings and delays.

The Lord wants us to obey Him and put our trust in Him (Isaiah 31:6) because only He can give us the perfect solution for our problems.  The sufferings and delays are meant to purify us or change us spiritually, while we wait.

### The Book of Baruch

[![The Book of Baruch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day206.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3bGZIpXDoqE "The Book of Baruch")

### Day #206 Praying for our leaders

When we read Baruch we get a sense of desperation of the people of Israel, who are in exile and unable to go to the temple to offer sacrifice. This can be related to those times during the Pandemic when all churches were closed and we could not go to Mass. Now the people gather some money to send temple priest who could pray on their behalf and offer sacrifices. The stunning piece is that they are requesting prayers for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon who has literally kept them in exile.
10 They said: Here we send you money; so buy with the money burnt offerings and sin offerings and incense, and prepare a grain offering, and offer them on the altar of the Lord our God; 11 and pray for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and for the life of his son Belshazzar, so that their days on earth may be like the days of heaven.
We are called to pray for our rulers, our bosses, our superiors, congressmen, and all governing and political leaders.
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. 1 Tim 2:1-3
We see Paul urging us to pray for our leaders and in the below verse, we are encouraged to be good citizens.
All of you must obey the government rulers. No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule. And no one rules now without that power from God. 2 So if anyone is against the government, he is really against what God has commanded. And so he brings punishment on himself. 3 Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers. But people who do wrong must fear them. Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers? Then do what is right, and the ruler will praise you. 4 He is God’s servant to help you. But if you do wrong, then be afraid. The ruler has the power to punish; he is God’s servant to punish those who do wrong. 5 So you must obey the government. You must obey not only because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.
6 And this is also why you pay taxes. Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work. 7 Pay everyone, then, what you owe him. If you owe any kind of tax, pay it. Show respect and honor to them all. Rom 13:1-7
We should be good citizens, follow the law and pay our taxes. Everyone needs prayers, especially our leaders. We should pray for them to have good understanding and that they make policies that are just to all. We should pray for our leaders, whether we like them or not. We should pray that their hearts will be open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Lord Will Come

[![The Lord Will Come](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day207.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gMcLeuFMo0g "The Lord Will Come")

### Day #207 The Lord will strengthen the weak hands and firm the feeble knees

To an exiled people these words would have been as sweet as honey.
Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, “Be strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.”
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. Is 35:3-6
Jesus fulfilled this promise, the widow and the orphan are cared for the blind receive their sight. The ears of the dead are opened, and the lame are leaping for joy like a deer. The mute tongue is now open, and they cannot stop praising God.
Let this word of God speak to us today even as we may feel exiled living in this world, which is full of people who are not interested in God. Most people in the world today are very self-satisfied and self-obsessed, just trying to gratify their own needs without even thinking of prayer. Jesus and matters of faith seem far from this generation, God is removed from schools and institutions. A generation of darkness seems to be evolving.
If we Christians feel like a weak minority, we can rest assured that Jesus will strengthen our feeble hands and firm our frail knees. My dear brother and sister who pray outside an Abortion center – “Be strong and do not fear Here is your God”
Let us pray that the eyes of those who promote evil be opened. Let us pray that the tongue of the oppressed be loosed so they can speak. Let the ears of those who ignore God's voice be opened. Let us be prepared for the day of the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Futility of Idols

[![The Futility of Idols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day208.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vacu6xvrrqY "The Futility of Idols")

### Day #208 False gods, idols, and superstition

Baruch 6 goes on and on about the false gods and idols, it seems almost repetitive. The idols made by man – made of wood, gold, and silver have no feelings and cannot do you any good or harm. It can be hard to worship an idol for that seems kind of stupid, but some people can be fearful that those objects may have some evil power over you.
Baruch reminds us not to be fearful of those false gods and religions.
Thus is it in no way apparent to us that they are gods; so do not fear them. For like a scarecrow in a cucumber patch, providing no protection, are their wooden, gilded, silvered gods. Baruch 6:69-70
Another thing that is false is superstitions like “crossing paths with a black cat brings bad luck ”, “cracked mirror brings bad luck”, and “A rabbit's foot will bring you luck”. These are just a few examples, but you get the idea – placing your faith in these practices is idolatry because you believe more in the black cat/mirror/dead rabbits’ foot than in Jesus Christ.

We need to recognize that every power in this world is weaker than God, the creator of the world. We should not have any fear of these false gods or idols.
The one fear that people may have, is the demonic influence on these objects. Occult or demonic influence on these objects is possible and it can affect you if you let it. The devil and the fallen angels can use anything to affect you, but that is only if you open yourself to it due to an unconfessed sin or a habitual sin that gives the devil an entry point. Let us remember that God in us is greater than any evil spirit in the world.
You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.1 John 4:4
Let us not have any superstitions or fears of evil but rejoice that the Spirit of Christ in our hearts is greater than anything else we may face.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### God Comforts His People

[![God Comforts His People](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day209.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UblitS2iG4Q "God Comforts His People")

### Day #209 Those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength

God’s people have been in distress – as they are exiled because of their unfaithfulness. God has not abandoned them but journeyed with them. God only wants them to change their hearts so that they can return to him. God speaks words of Comfort to Isaiah.
Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. Is 40:1,2
When the word comfort is used – one would usually think of a cool Air-conditioned room with a comfortable couch and a cool drink. But God’s comfort is to be found only in us repnting from the evil that we are doing. The comfort of the Lord can be found when we repent, rend our hearts and seek after him. The comfort of God can be found when we prepare the way for the Lord. When we make straight the paths, level the mountains and welcome God into our hearts.
A voice cries out: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” Is 40:3-5
John the Baptist was that voice that cried out in the wilderness, and the church now cries out every advent and lent – asking us to repent and to receive God’s comfort. We are also called to repent every time we fall, we are called to repent in the sacrament of confession. Every parish cries out through its scheduled confessions every week - a call to repent.
Because once we repent and seek the Lord, He will renew our strength. He will give power to the faint, and strength to the powerless. Even if the young and strong of the world fail, those who wait on the Lord will never faint but will renew their strength. We will mount up with wings like eagles.
The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.
Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. Is 40:28-31
May you feel comfort by repenting and renew your strength today.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 209 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 40:3
\*A voice cries out in the wilderness, “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”\*

Isaiah was prophesying about the arrival of a prophet (John the Baptist) who would prepare the people for the arrival of the Messiah into their hearts by calling them to repentance.  Meanwhile, Jesus Himself would prepare a pure vessel (Mary) for His arrival into the world because God would not enter an unclean heart or an unclean womb.

Isaiah 40:9-11
In the ancient pagan world, a king/emperor was worshipped as god, and the birth of a son, the heir to the throne, was announced as "good news" ("evangelion" in Greek) because the heir was believed to be the son of god (the king/ emperor), who would save their people from their physical enemies.

Isaiah used the same concept to announce the good news of the birth of the future king and God of Israel who would save them from their enemies and oppression.

The Jews were suffering in exile because their sins and non-repentance had separated them from God.  When they repented, God promised to come down Himself, as their good shepherd king, to save them.

The Judeans did receive a king in the future who delivered them from physical exile but Isaiah was also prophetically speaking of the ultimate divine king Jesus who would save them and us from spiritual exile.

### Speaking God's Word

[![Speaking God's Word](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day210.jpg)](https://youtu.be/87uaV3AZwXc "Speaking God's Word")

### Day #210 Evangelization is not optional

The prophet Ezekiel has this great vision of God in all his glory. After the vision, Ezekiel is commissioned to go out and proclaim the word of God. He is asked to eat the scroll with God’s word and he is now the mouthpiece of the Lord. He has no option but to proclaim the message that he was entrusted with. He is made a watchman of the house of Israel.
“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 18 If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. 20 Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life.” Ez 3 17-21
We read all the scenarios above in detail, Ezekiel’s job is to proclaim God’s word if he fails to do that the blood of the wicked man would be on Ezekiel. Again there may be different ways that people may respond for God gave everyone free will. But it is our duty to proclaim God’s love, saving grace and judgement on the world. God does not want to condemn the world but to save it.
If you were asked to go out and speak to others about God, you may feel insecure or hesitant. But God reminds us in Isaiah that we should not fear, for God is with us he is our help and strength.
“You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”; 10 do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand. Is 41:9,10
The above verse is worth memorizing it gives us strength when said in times of fear and doubt.
Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 15 Now, I will make of you a threshing sledge, sharp, new, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff. 16 You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. Isaiah 41:14-16
We will be made strong and will become like a threshing sledge that will crush mountains and hills into chaff that the wind will carry away. God will make us strong and we will triumph over every situation. Our duty is to proclaim and speak to people, God will be with us and the response is up to them. Evangelization is not an optional calling but mandatory for every Christian, if not the blood of the wicked will be on our hands.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 210 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Isaiah 42:6-7
\*I am the Lord; I have called you in righteousness; I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.\*

God gave the old Israel to the world as a Covenant / mediator and as a light to the nations, to make Him known and to bring the world to Him.  He wanted them to open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, to release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and to be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

This prophecy was fulfilled in the Upper Room when Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper and gave us His living Body, in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to receive Him as the Covenant between God and man, a Covenant between flesh and Spirit, a Covenant between human and divine, a Covenant between corruptible and incorruptible.  Through the sacraments Jesus would open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, He would release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and He would  be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins (Luke 4:18-21).
As followers of Christ we must continue bringing people close to Christ by being a light to the world through love and generosity.

Ezekiel 2:1-5
Ezekiel lived around 587 BC, around the time when Solomon's Temple was destroyed. Ezekiel was a priest in the Temple. God commanded him to go and prophesy to the people of Israel and to warn them about the forthcoming destruction of the Temple if they didn't turn from their evil ways.  By commanding Ezekiel to prophesy to a nation of rebellious people, God was commissioning him to be rejected.

Ezekiel was a shadow of Jesus.  Jesus too received a similar response from majority of the Israelites, but that didn’t stop Him from preaching to the people.

The Church too has a similar mission.
When we share the Word of God with the world, we should not expect that all will accept Christ, but that should not discourage us or stop us from sharing the Word of God.
When a farmer sows seeds it is not necessary that all will fall on rich soil (Matthew 13:8).
Let us, therefore, be on the sharing side of the Word, not on the rejecting side.

Ezekiel 3:18-19
\*“If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.”\*
\*“If you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life.”\*

When God makes us aware that someone is committing a sin and we don't correct them or stop them, then we too are guilty of sin along with them.
But if we try to correct or stop someone from sinning and they refuse to correct themselves then they will be condemned but we will be without guilt for that particular sin.

In the new Covenant, a priest saves his own soul whenever he retains the sins of an unrepentant sinner by judiciously denying absolution as a warning (John 20:23).

### Called by Name

[![Called by Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day211.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SqdSqImqv9Q "Called by Name")

### Day #211 I have called you by name, you are mine.

We are precious in God’s eyes, each one of us has been called by name. We belong to God, we are His. God created and formed us, knit us together in our mother’s wombs. God loves us so much that He will give nations in exchange for us. When we go through tough times, we will not be overwhelmed. He will redeem us, we need not fear.
But now thus says the Lord, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: “Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you. 4 Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life. 5 Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you; Is 43:1-5
We sometimes think that we decide to pray or go to church, but the desire for prayer is initiated by God. We need to realize that, God choose us first and knew us even before we knew ourselves.
16 You did not choose me but I chose you. John 15:16
Even before the prodigal son decided to come back home, the father was waiting every day for his return, Even before the lost sheep was found, the good shepherd went out to find him. In the same way even before we pray, God is initiating us and calling us. God knows us through and through, even before a word in on our lips He already knows it.
Even before a word is on my tongue, O Lord, you know it completely. Ps 139:4
Let us totally rely on God because it is he who called us, choose us, and knows everything about us. He will be with us when we go through troubles, the waters will not drown us or the fires burn us. We will not be overwhelmed but redeemed by God Himself.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Isaiah 44:28
\*Thus says the Lord your Redeemer of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd, and he shall carry out all my purpose”; and of Jerusalem, “It shall be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.”\*

Isaiah prophesied that king Cyrus would carry out God’s Will to rebuild the Temple, about 150 years before Cyrus was even born.

God plans everything for us too in advance but we destroy God’s plans for us by disobeying God and walking with the evil one.

### Day #212 I will go before you

When we are asked to do something new or when change arises, we tend to fear. We feel afraid when we have a big task at hand either at work or church or at home. We sometimes feel that we are all alone and no one is supporting us. If you have chronic conditions and feel that there is limited or no medical treatment.
If you are facing any situation that makes you fearful and you have hit a roadblock, pray the below verse over and over again. For God will go before you and level the mountains, break in pieces the doors of bronze, and break the bars of iron.
“I will go before you and level the mountains, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut asunder the bars of iron, 3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoards in secret places, that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who call you by your name. 4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. Is 45:2-4
There will be a great breakthrough for those who pray this verse repeatedly. God will give great treasures to those who persevere and push forward in prayer. God has called us by name and surnamed us as well. Let us not fear but trust in God who goes before us.
The God who created us and knows us even before we were created, will sustain us and care for us even till our old age when we get gray.
who have been borne by me from your birth, carried from the womb; 4 even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. Is 46:3,4
As one ages they tend to feel abandoned and left out by society and family. Older people feel as though everything is ending and they don’t have anyone who cares for them. Remember that God is on your side, He cares for you – He is the same yesterday, today, and forever – whether you are young or old. Even if society and family leave you, God will never abandon you. Rest assured that God is on your side and he goes before you leveling all the mountains and breaking all the gates that come in your way.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### DAY 212 By Sheila

ISAIAH begins with Cyrus as God's lnstrument anointed and subdued before HIM. To break and open lron Gates, Bronze Bars. To know hidden, secret places of rich treasure no one can see.
I The Lord do all these things, even though Cyrus did not acknowledge God.
In the past, Prophets and Holy Men were anointed to do the Lord's Work. What a mighty contrast, His own people have neglected and do not carry Him. Rather they carry idols, loaded on over burdened beasts.
EZEKIEL: expresses in Prophetic Writings and refers to the Day of The Lord. A time of decisive judgement, a point of utter destruction, to those who dwell in the land. The daily routine of life as God's people would end.
PROVERBS: We eventually become that on which we allow our minds to dwell. Words can bring satisfaction when they are wise or disaster when unwise.
Let's bear words as deeds that bear fruits.

### Day #213 Shutting God out of our lives

One pitfall to Christians would be to shut God out of certain areas of our lives. We tend to make an idol of the true God, that is we make God in our own image and likeness instead of being shaped by Him. We are clay and He is the potter, can the clay decide on its shape should be?
Sometimes we want to shut God out of certain areas of life and give into our own desires and designs.
A few examples:

1. We can decide that using contraceptives is a good practice and shut God out of our lives instead of being open to life.
2. We can decide that “Just being a good person will get us to heaven – and do not have any relationship with God”
3. We can determine that there is no need to go to church once a week, just praying at home and reading your bible is enough
4. We can decide that there is no need to go to confession, I will confess my sins straight to God.
5. We can decide that Jesus is not present in the Blessed Sacrament, it’s just a piece of bread
   The prophet Isaiah warns us about this, of being self-contained and satisfied, of being our own god.
   You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, “No one sees me”; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, “I am, and there is no one besides me.” 11 But evil shall come upon you, for which you cannot atone; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to expiate; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing. Is 47:10,11
   We just cannot continue in our wickedness or by believing our own truth. Relativism is taking over young minds, and everyone wants to believe their own truth. It’s not about what you think or I think, it’s about what God wants for us, How does he want to be worshiped? What is He calling us to?
   God created us and knows best, let us listen to Him.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
