### Israel Falls to Assyria

[![Israel Falls to Assyria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day183.jpg)](https://youtu.be/15U03S2_D6g "Israel Falls to Assyria")

### Day #183 God permits suffering when we stray from Him, only so that it may cause us to return to the straight path.

Most parents must have corrected the kids this way ‚ÄúClean your room or else no Ice cream tonight‚Äù. This is called reward-based training, something that we even follow when we train a puppy. And when the kids make mistakes, they are grounded or their toys are taken away until they learn a lesson.
The Israelites needed some tough love from the Lord, because of their continuous sins, their rebellion, and stiff-neckedness.
Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, ‚ÄúTurn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.‚Äù They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence. 2 Kings 17:13,14, 18,19
The Lord after giving them numerous chances, and sending many prophets with warning messages finally just lifted His hedge from the Israelites and they were exposed to their enemies. The whole of Israelites is now away from the presence of the Lord.
This is the case sometimes with us as well, we are so pigheaded that we just want to have our way with everything. We just want to continue in our sin and gratify our cravings, give in to temptations, and just do not want to listen to God and do not want to follow His teachings. The Lord is patient, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, however, He is a good parent as well. He will not spare the rod and spoil the kid, God will allow some suffering which will possibly cause us to think of our father‚Äôs house, like the prodigal son and we would possibly return home. Let us return to the arms of the Father.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 17:5-9 & 24

\*Then the king of Assyria occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years.  The king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.  This came about because the Israelites sinned against the LORD, their God by adopting unlawful practices and worshipping idols like the pagan nations around them.\*

The king of Assyria scattered the Israelites all over the surrounding pagan nations, then brought 5 pagan nations to inhabit Samaria so that the pagans could have mixed marriages with the Israelites, with the intention that the Israelites would lose their bloodline, their culture, their religion, and their allegiance to their king, thus preventing the possibility of future rebellion.  These mixed descendants came to be known as the Samaritans.

After being scattered because of their sins, if the Israelites would have repented and turned back to God, then even if they had married the pagans they would have been able to bring all their pagan spouses and in-laws to God and the ten tribes would not have been lost.

Like the Israelites, we too are called to be holy.  We must live our lives like Christ did.  When we have mixed marriages, one of the ways we can evangelize our non-Christian spouses and in-laws is by living our Christian life faithfully so that we can bring them to Christ.  But when we start living our lives like the non-Christians to please our spouses and in-laws, then, like those 10 tribes of Israel, our Christian community too will start diminishing.

Micah 5:2-3

\*But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.\*

This was the text which led the magi to Jerusalem to look for the Messiah, but they didn't find Him in the palace. And when King Herod enquired about it his priests knew what was already prophesied through Micah.

God chose a small insignificant town for His Son to be born, and through the womb of an even more insignificant woman.

God uses less to do more. God uses something negligible to do something large.
We don't have to be famous or popular for God to use us for His divine mission. We don't even have to be experts or perfect in anything. He will use our mistakes to teach us. He only wants our "yes" for Him to start using us.

\*Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.\*

God would hand over His people to their enemies until the time the Messiah would come into the world and deliver them from slavery.

Thus, when Jesus came to earth, Israel was physically under the oppression of the Romans because of their sins but Jesus gave them hope for liberation from spiritual slavery (forgiveness of sins) for those who accepted Him.

Micah  6:7-8
\*Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?‚Äù\*

Micah was referring to the king of Moab who offered his first born son and defeat was turned to victory. Therefore the demon-inspired people around Israel were trapping themselves into all kinds of infernal powers and thus tempted the people of God to look elsewhere for their own source of power (2 Kings 3:27).

\*He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\*

God has already told us what He wants us to do to receive eternal life but, like those Israelites, we too choose to go our own way.  God is not asking us to perform any Herculean task; all that He wants from us is to be just, kind and humble and obey His commandments.

### DAY 183: By Sheila

KINGS: In the 12Year of King Ahaz, Hoshea reigns Samaria for 9Years. Shalmanesar attacked, settled the territory and carried away the Israelites to Assyrian Cities.
Israel's Sins: Hence began Intermarriages, the worship of idols, violation of God's Law and improper Worship of God.
MICAH: The City Jerusalem would suffer seige because of its sins. The Birth Place of the Shepherd King would be Bethlehem. By predicting a New King from Bethlehem, Micah was invoking the Covenant God made with David Centuries later, at the Birth of Jesus, where the Wise Men question, concerning where the Christ was to be born.
Judah's Kings were insecure as strength, to assure lasting peace for God's Chosen People. JESUS, The Great King Of Israel is Our Only Peace.
God would not stop with only Redeeming a remnant of Israel, theirs would be the Presence of God's people, would be to the Nation's like Life-Giving Water. The Prophet Micah revealed, they would also be like a 'lion' among the Gentiles as St. Paul describes the Church in 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.
God has a legal court case then for violation of the Covenant. He called the Hills and Mountains, who had witnessed Israel's transgressions to hear the case.
What had God done to deserve rejection of His Covenant? Had HE not Supernaturally redeemed them from slavery in Egypt?
God reminded them of events during their Wilderness Journey that revealed His Righteousness and Power.
God's people gave no explanation to His Question. God connected His people through Micah by demanding Justice, Mercy and Obedience, qualities lacking in Judah.
Messages of 8th Century Prophets: Amos called for Justice. Hosea kindness. Isaiah to obey and to walk humbly with God. Micah stated boldly that only God could right such wrong. He encouraged through suffering in Judgment was certain, it was also temporary. Micah prayed for protection too.
Psalm: The Psalmist  expressed in confidence that only God can deliver from the power of evil men and punish the evil-doers.
Let's put our confidence in faith that GOD is our Deliverer.

### Hezekiah Reigns

[![Hezekiah Reigns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day184.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L0kfDab7d2c "Hezekiah Reigns")

### Day #184 Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord

This Psalm makes for such a good prayer, that we can pray every morning.
Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds Ps 141:3,4
Many people are hurt by words, it is said that words hurt harder than punches. Words have power and they can either build up a person or tear down. Most people can remember the good and bad things that were said to them, some even remember the words they heard as children. We need to be very careful about what we say, and how we say it. The words we speak can bring destruction and cause discouragement, especially to our kids and anyone under us at work, and even our family and friends.
The mouth speaks what the heart is full of and it's very easy to speak hurtful words when we are angry or upset. Words once spoken are like a bullet fired, they cannot be taken back. We are called to tame the tongue, by practicing self-control.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one‚Äôs life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. James 3:3-6
Beautiful examples like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth, the rudder, and the ship, and the spark and the forest should help us realize that a small word spoken out of hate can cause a relationship to be set on fire, or a ship to sink, if we lose control of our tongue we will lose control of the whole body ‚Äì like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth.
Let us pray and ask the Lord to guard our mouths, and keep watch on our lips.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Hezekiah's Prayer

[![Hezekiah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day185.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ykiLZLMDkMY "Hezekiah's Prayer")

### BIAY Day 185 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 19:9-36
When the king of Assyria threatened to attack Judah, King Hezekiah was very disturbed.

King Hezekiah was very devoted to the Lord and therefore whenever he was in fear or distress he immediately went to the Temple and prayed to the Lord.  Inspite of having his royal advisors he wanted the eternal divine perspective on the situation and the path forward for him. He didn't want to look at things from the limited human perspective and worry about them as they appeared to him.  He therefore didn't go to his advisors to ask for advice.  He wanted to see things as God saw them.  He went to the Temple to remind himself of who is really in control and who alone can truly help him.  And God showed him a vision of how, in the past, with His power God had delivered His people from their enemies who were even stronger than the king of Assyria.  Thereafter King Hezekiah put himself in that picture as a victorious king.

King Hezekiah's prayer is a great example for us to follow. He did not pray to God for self-preservation or for the preservation of his people and the Temple. He prayed to God to make their small kingdom victorious over the powerful nation so that God's name could be glorified in the world. Thus, by glorifying God's name in the world, salvation would come to the world.

When we are in fear or in distress, let us depend on God to make His power known to the world.  Let us not place our trust in our wealth or in humans.
Let us focus on the salvation of the world and not just on the salvation of ourselves, our families and our communities.

Psalm 143:8-10
*Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust.*
*Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.*
*Save me, O Lord, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.*
*Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.*
*Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.*

If we spend time with the Lord in the morning, He will deliver us from our enemies/evil, He will teach us to do His Will through the day and He will send His good Spirit to lead us.

Jesus also prayed in the early hours of the morning.

### Day #185 How to approach God when we have an impossible situation on hand.

After a lot of bad Kings, we see Hezekiah, a somewhat good king of Judah. Hezekiah has this impossible situation on hand because Sennacherib the king of Assyria who defeated all the bigger nations in the area is now planning to attack this little nation and they send a letter mocking Israel‚Äôs faith in God. When Hezekiah received the letter, he responded by going to the House of the Lord, he spread out the letter in front of the Lord and prayed and asked the Lord for His intervention in this seemingly impossible task at hand. He then summoned the remnant from the North, remember they had not come to Jerusalem to worship due to the divided kingdom. Now many people came to the temple from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Judah to celebrate the feast of Passover. Those gathered just wanted to pray and worship God. Praying together was so good that after 7 days of community prayer, they wanted to pray for 7 more days. May we be blessed with this spirit of perseverance in prayer.
This is such an incredible way to approach God when we have tough decisions to make or impossible tasks at hand. Just go to the House of the Lord and spread out/surrender the problem/ situation. Seek God‚Äôs guidance and intervention in the situation. Also, another lesson to learn here is to seek the community‚Äôs prayer ‚Äì we see that most of Israel come together to pray. We are not meant to live this Christian life alone.
We are the body of Christ; one member cannot say it does not need the other just like a leg cannot say I do not need the hand. We are one body in Christ and if one member suffers the whole body suffers. Let us share our problems with the local Church community and seek their prayers and support. Also, the Local Church community is not alone, we are all part of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church on earth is not alone, for we are connected to the Church Suffering and the Church Triumphant. The Church militant is the Catholic Church on earth, the Church suffering is the Church in purgatory and the Church Triumphant are all those who made it to heaven, the saints. We the Church ‚Äì militant, suffering, and triumphant are all the body of Christ and He is the head. There is nothing to fear and we can never be alone, for we have a great church ‚Äì a large multitude and an even greater God who knows everything about us and already has our prayers in the works. He is moving forward ‚Äì before us working things out for us. Let us not forget to request the church to pray for our intentions, and not fear because God cares for us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
