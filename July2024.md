### Israel Falls to Assyria

[![Israel Falls to Assyria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day183.jpg)](https://youtu.be/15U03S2_D6g "Israel Falls to Assyria")

### Day #183 God permits suffering when we stray from Him, only so that it may cause us to return to the straight path.

Most parents must have corrected the kids this way ‚ÄúClean your room or else no Ice cream tonight‚Äù. This is called reward-based training, something that we even follow when we train a puppy. And when the kids make mistakes, they are grounded or their toys are taken away until they learn a lesson.
The Israelites needed some tough love from the Lord, because of their continuous sins, their rebellion, and stiff-neckedness.
Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, ‚ÄúTurn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.‚Äù They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence. 2 Kings 17:13,14, 18,19
The Lord after giving them numerous chances, and sending many prophets with warning messages finally just lifted His hedge from the Israelites and they were exposed to their enemies. The whole of Israelites is now away from the presence of the Lord.
This is the case sometimes with us as well, we are so pigheaded that we just want to have our way with everything. We just want to continue in our sin and gratify our cravings, give in to temptations, and just do not want to listen to God and do not want to follow His teachings. The Lord is patient, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, however, He is a good parent as well. He will not spare the rod and spoil the kid, God will allow some suffering which will possibly cause us to think of our father‚Äôs house, like the prodigal son and we would possibly return home. Let us return to the arms of the Father.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 183 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 17:5-9 & 24

\*Then the king of Assyria occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years.  The king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.  This came about because the Israelites sinned against the LORD, their God by adopting unlawful practices and worshipping idols like the pagan nations around them.\*

The king of Assyria scattered the Israelites all over the surrounding pagan nations, then brought 5 pagan nations to inhabit Samaria so that the pagans could have mixed marriages with the Israelites, with the intention that the Israelites would lose their bloodline, their culture, their religion, and their allegiance to their king, thus preventing the possibility of future rebellion.  These mixed descendants came to be known as the Samaritans.

After being scattered because of their sins, if the Israelites would have repented and turned back to God, then even if they had married the pagans they would have been able to bring all their pagan spouses and in-laws to God and the ten tribes would not have been lost.

Like the Israelites, we too are called to be holy.  We must live our lives like Christ did.  When we have mixed marriages, one of the ways we can evangelize our non-Christian spouses and in-laws is by living our Christian life faithfully so that we can bring them to Christ.  But when we start living our lives like the non-Christians to please our spouses and in-laws, then, like those 10 tribes of Israel, our Christian community too will start diminishing.

Micah 5:2-3

\*But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.\*

This was the text which led the magi to Jerusalem to look for the Messiah, but they didn't find Him in the palace. And when King Herod enquired about it his priests knew what was already prophesied through Micah.

God chose a small insignificant town for His Son to be born, and through the womb of an even more insignificant woman.

God uses less to do more. God uses something negligible to do something large.
We don't have to be famous or popular for God to use us for His divine mission. We don't even have to be experts or perfect in anything. He will use our mistakes to teach us. He only wants our "yes" for Him to start using us.

\*Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.\*

God would hand over His people to their enemies until the time the Messiah would come into the world and deliver them from slavery.

Thus, when Jesus came to earth, Israel was physically under the oppression of the Romans because of their sins but Jesus gave them hope for liberation from spiritual slavery (forgiveness of sins) for those who accepted Him.

Micah  6:7-8
\*Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?‚Äù\*

Micah was referring to the king of Moab who offered his first born son and defeat was turned to victory. Therefore the demon-inspired people around Israel were trapping themselves into all kinds of infernal powers and thus tempted the people of God to look elsewhere for their own source of power (2 Kings 3:27).

\*He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\*

God has already told us what He wants us to do to receive eternal life but, like those Israelites, we too choose to go our own way.  God is not asking us to perform any Herculean task; all that He wants from us is to be just, kind and humble and obey His commandments.

### DAY 183: By Sheila

KINGS: In the 12Year of King Ahaz, Hoshea reigns Samaria for 9Years. Shalmanesar attacked, settled the territory and carried away the Israelites to Assyrian Cities.
Israel's Sins: Hence began Intermarriages, the worship of idols, violation of God's Law and improper Worship of God.
MICAH: The City Jerusalem would suffer seige because of its sins. The Birth Place of the Shepherd King would be Bethlehem. By predicting a New King from Bethlehem, Micah was invoking the Covenant God made with David Centuries later, at the Birth of Jesus, where the Wise Men question, concerning where the Christ was to be born.
Judah's Kings were insecure as strength, to assure lasting peace for God's Chosen People. JESUS, The Great King Of Israel is Our Only Peace.
God would not stop with only Redeeming a remnant of Israel, theirs would be the Presence of God's people, would be to the Nation's like Life-Giving Water. The Prophet Micah revealed, they would also be like a 'lion' among the Gentiles as St. Paul describes the Church in 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.
God has a legal court case then for violation of the Covenant. He called the Hills and Mountains, who had witnessed Israel's transgressions to hear the case.
What had God done to deserve rejection of His Covenant? Had HE not Supernaturally redeemed them from slavery in Egypt?
God reminded them of events during their Wilderness Journey that revealed His Righteousness and Power.
God's people gave no explanation to His Question. God connected His people through Micah by demanding Justice, Mercy and Obedience, qualities lacking in Judah.
Messages of 8th Century Prophets: Amos called for Justice. Hosea kindness. Isaiah to obey and to walk humbly with God. Micah stated boldly that only God could right such wrong. He encouraged through suffering in Judgment was certain, it was also temporary. Micah prayed for protection too.
Psalm: The Psalmist  expressed in confidence that only God can deliver from the power of evil men and punish the evil-doers.
Let's put our confidence in faith that GOD is our Deliverer.

### Hezekiah Reigns

[![Hezekiah Reigns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day184.jpg)](https://youtu.be/L0kfDab7d2c "Hezekiah Reigns")

### Day #184 Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord

This Psalm makes for such a good prayer, that we can pray every morning.
Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds Ps 141:3,4
Many people are hurt by words, it is said that words hurt harder than punches. Words have power and they can either build up a person or tear down. Most people can remember the good and bad things that were said to them, some even remember the words they heard as children. We need to be very careful about what we say, and how we say it. The words we speak can bring destruction and cause discouragement, especially to our kids and anyone under us at work, and even our family and friends.
The mouth speaks what the heart is full of and it's very easy to speak hurtful words when we are angry or upset. Words once spoken are like a bullet fired, they cannot be taken back. We are called to tame the tongue, by practicing self-control.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one‚Äôs life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. James 3:3-6
Beautiful examples like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth, the rudder, and the ship, and the spark and the forest should help us realize that a small word spoken out of hate can cause a relationship to be set on fire, or a ship to sink, if we lose control of our tongue we will lose control of the whole body ‚Äì like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth.
Let us pray and ask the Lord to guard our mouths, and keep watch on our lips.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Hezekiah's Prayer

[![Hezekiah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day185.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ykiLZLMDkMY "Hezekiah's Prayer")

### BIAY Day 185 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 19:9-36
When the king of Assyria threatened to attack Judah, King Hezekiah was very disturbed.

King Hezekiah was very devoted to the Lord and therefore whenever he was in fear or distress he immediately went to the Temple and prayed to the Lord.  Inspite of having his royal advisors he wanted the eternal divine perspective on the situation and the path forward for him. He didn't want to look at things from the limited human perspective and worry about them as they appeared to him.  He therefore didn't go to his advisors to ask for advice.  He wanted to see things as God saw them.  He went to the Temple to remind himself of who is really in control and who alone can truly help him.  And God showed him a vision of how, in the past, with His power God had delivered His people from their enemies who were even stronger than the king of Assyria.  Thereafter King Hezekiah put himself in that picture as a victorious king.

King Hezekiah's prayer is a great example for us to follow. He did not pray to God for self-preservation or for the preservation of his people and the Temple. He prayed to God to make their small kingdom victorious over the powerful nation so that God's name could be glorified in the world. Thus, by glorifying God's name in the world, salvation would come to the world.

When we are in fear or in distress, let us depend on God to make His power known to the world.  Let us not place our trust in our wealth or in humans.
Let us focus on the salvation of the world and not just on the salvation of ourselves, our families and our communities.

Psalm 143:8-10
*Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust.*
*Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.*
*Save me, O Lord, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.*
*Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.*
*Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.*

If we spend time with the Lord in the morning, He will deliver us from our enemies/evil, He will teach us to do His Will through the day and He will send His good Spirit to lead us.

Jesus also prayed in the early hours of the morning.

### Day #185 How to approach God when we have an impossible situation on hand.

After a lot of bad Kings, we see Hezekiah, a somewhat good king of Judah. Hezekiah has this impossible situation on hand because Sennacherib the king of Assyria who defeated all the bigger nations in the area is now planning to attack this little nation and they send a letter mocking Israel‚Äôs faith in God. When Hezekiah received the letter, he responded by going to the House of the Lord, he spread out the letter in front of the Lord and prayed and asked the Lord for His intervention in this seemingly impossible task at hand. He then summoned the remnant from the North, remember they had not come to Jerusalem to worship due to the divided kingdom. Now many people came to the temple from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Judah to celebrate the feast of Passover. Those gathered just wanted to pray and worship God. Praying together was so good that after 7 days of community prayer, they wanted to pray for 7 more days. May we be blessed with this spirit of perseverance in prayer.
This is such an incredible way to approach God when we have tough decisions to make or impossible tasks at hand. Just go to the House of the Lord and spread out/surrender the problem/ situation. Seek God‚Äôs guidance and intervention in the situation. Also, another lesson to learn here is to seek the community‚Äôs prayer ‚Äì we see that most of Israel come together to pray. We are not meant to live this Christian life alone.
We are the body of Christ; one member cannot say it does not need the other just like a leg cannot say I do not need the hand. We are one body in Christ and if one member suffers the whole body suffers. Let us share our problems with the local Church community and seek their prayers and support. Also, the Local Church community is not alone, we are all part of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church on earth is not alone, for we are connected to the Church Suffering and the Church Triumphant. The Church militant is the Catholic Church on earth, the Church suffering is the Church in purgatory and the Church Triumphant are all those who made it to heaven, the saints. We the Church ‚Äì militant, suffering, and triumphant are all the body of Christ and He is the head. There is nothing to fear and we can never be alone, for we have a great church ‚Äì a large multitude and an even greater God who knows everything about us and already has our prayers in the works. He is moving forward ‚Äì before us working things out for us. Let us not forget to request the church to pray for our intentions, and not fear because God cares for us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 185 By Sheila

KINGS: The siege of Jerusalem describes a Second Attack on Judah after a lapse of time, the fact that Sennacherib was reconquering them. Assyrian Conquerors often led captives by means of hooks in their noses (2 Kings Verse 28)
The Mercy Seat: Inspite of Sennacherib's threat, Hezekiah prayed to the One who dwells between the Cherubim.
YOU ARE GOD, YOU ALONE. Of all the Kingdoms of the earth, Heaven and earth is Yours. Incline and hear the words of Sennacherib to reproach The Living God.

Isaiah's Prophecy: Although Assyria would occupy the Land and reap it's crop, Judah would not be entirely destroyed. Like a plant that lies dormant, Judah would appear conquered but would again bear fruit. Sennacherib's death is a fulfillment of Prophecy.
CHRONICLES: Hezekiah and all Israel and Judah celebrated the Passover Feast. The celebration of Passover, thus recalling the escape from Egypt, The escape especially from the hand of the Kings of Assyria and where there is sin, repentance and restoration may also be found. (Chronicles 30:6-9).
PSALM: "CRY OUT" For a favourable hearing from God or forgiveness in order that HE would not be overwhelmed with HIS Judgment.

Let us pray and know that none is righteous before GOD.

### Struggles with Self-Interest

[![Struggles with Self-Interest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day186.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XaJcTFlVvBU "Struggles with Self-Interest")

### Day #186 The danger of sharing your problems with everyone.

In the day and age of social media and high tech, posts and tweets can reach a really large audience. The ease at which you can reach an audience has its positives and negatives. Almost everyone has their cell phone always with them, people post stuff anytime and in different mindsets/emotional states. We need to be very careful about our privacy settings and the content that we post, if we post all our problems on social media, we run the risk of exposing ourselves to people who could use that information to exploit us in the future or to take advantage of us. So always pray before you post anything and be very cautious about what you post.
In today‚Äôs readings, we see this pretty good King Hezekiah make a mistake by showing everything to the Babylonians. It‚Äôs worth reading the whole story.
At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, ‚ÄúWhat did these men say? From where did they come to you?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have come from a far country, from Babylon.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhat have they seen in your house?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.‚Äù
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‚ÄúHear the word of the Lord: Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.‚Äù 2 Kings 20:12-19
Hezekiah‚Äôs mistake will cause the whole nation to suffer and the Babylonians will carry away all of their positions and even his sons will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Let us learn a lesson from Hezekiah, let us be wise in what we post on social media. Also we should be wise with what we share with our friends and colleagues. Also what we share with our pastor or counselors, just telling them stuff is different from making a confession. Nothing shared in the sacrament of confession will be shared outside because the sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." Be careful when you are sharing stuff with a prayer partner or a group leader be careful about what you share. Share what is necessary and let the Holy Spirit guide you.
Let us not be like King Hezekiah who showed everything and brought disaster to Israel. Let us be controlled in what we post and say.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 186 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 20:6
King Hezekiah was mortally ill (2 Kings 20:1) but God extended his life by 15 years because of Hezekiah‚Äôs righteousness (obedience) and because he repented (2 Kings 20:3).  Thus by extending Hezekiah‚Äôs life God gave him another chance and during the next fifteen years God blessed Hezekiah with a son who would be his successor to the Davidic throne.

But instead of being thankful and giving glory to God for his extended life, Hezekiah's heart was filled with pride and he started boasting about his achievements and treasures to strangers (the Babylonians) who later attacked his country to grab those same treasures, which may have been out of greed or envy.

There may have been some time in our life when we thought it was going to be our end due to some serious illness or a calamity, etc., but we miraculously survived.  If God says that we will die soon because of our sins, He could change His plan and extend our lives if we repented, just as He did with Nineveh (Jonah 3:10), or He could be giving us a chance to repent after we recover, and the illness or calamity, etc. may have been a warning.

In such situations we must remember that God does not extend our life for us to enjoy it and waste it by continuing in our sinful ways.  God will extend our life because He wants our life to be part of His divine plan, which was disrupted because of our sins.  Therefore, after we overcome the illness or calamity, etc., we must ensure to repent and ask God to help us know His Will for us.

Of course, if we still ignore God‚Äôs Will or refuse to repent after we recover, God will definitely find another way to accomplish His divine plan, but if He has given us a second chance, we would be foolish to ignore His blessing and we would be walking towards our eternal destruction.

On the other hand, if we have led a life that is holy in God‚Äôs eyes, and we have survived a serious illness or a calamity, etc., then it may have been either for our spiritual healing or because God has a special mission for us.

Let us also be careful about what and how much information we share about our personal & private lives with others.  Boasting is an act of the devil therefore we do not know which of our listeners it will cause to burn with envy, greed or revenge.

### Praying for Time

[![Praying for Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day187.jpg)](https://youtu.be/INb2hRyPxqE "Praying for Time")

### Day #187 Praying for more time to live

King Hezekiah was on his death bed when he prayed for more time. The Lord gave him 15 more years of life, but did he make it count. He absolutely failed with those 15 more years, we can recall how he exposed the secrets of the Kingdom of Israel in yesterday‚Äôs readings. He also was filled with a lot of pride, considering all the possessions as his own rather than the Lord‚Äôs. He also had a son Manasseh in those last 15 years, who turned out to be one of the worst kings.
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, ‚ÄúIn Jerusalem I will put my name.‚Äù He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. 2 Kings 2:21
The deeds of Manasseh are even unimaginable ‚Äì sacrificing his own son to pagan gods.
Sometimes when we push our way with the Lord, God accepts our request and gives us another chance. We need to make the most of it rather than do more evil. When we pray for more time to live or for healing or for a problem to resolve, we should remember to become better persons after the prayer is answered.
We see many people praying prayers like ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will donate $100 to a charity‚Äù these prayers are more of a bribe. Or should we pray prayers like ‚Äì ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will give up this evil habit‚Äù No the correct way to pray is ‚ÄúLord I will give up this evil habit whether you heal me or not because it draws me away from you". Let us become better children of God every time we receive a blessing from Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Book of the Law

[![The Book of the Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day188.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rP44kIbiNBc "The Book of the Law")

### Day #188 Avoid the near occasion of sin.

In today‚Äôs proverb, we can find some good advice about living a chaste life. The example given is about a young man who seems to have gone the wrong way. The author of the proverb looks out of the window of his house and notices a senseless young man among the simple. This youth seems to be walking the streets and looking for this woman. This woman is not a harlot, but a married woman dressed like a harlot. The woman‚Äôs husband has gone on a long journey, and she seems to be on every street corner trying to seduce the youth.
Now no one knows if this story is true or not, but the takeaway for us should be the warning. The young man needs to be careful about the path he takes, for he may take a path that has trapped many and led them to hell. Let us read this warning for ourselves and be warned.
With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. Prov 7: 22-27
Now, this can be taken literally and is very relevant to our generation, where there are so many extramarital relationships. I assume that most of us reading this do not struggle with the sin of marital fidelity, we can apply this to any sin. The devil is a roaring lion roaming everywhere, trying to find someone to devour. We have to be careful not to entertain sin too much or the near occasion of sin, lest the devil will afflict us/devour us.
Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. 1 Pet 5:8
We also need to guard ourselves against our flesh, for if we do not be careful, we can easily fall into sin.
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.‚Äù Gen 4:7
This warning was given to Cain, we should also heed it and master our flesh and sin.
Let us be watchful in prayer and avoid the near occasion of sin. Sin can arise from the world, the flesh, or the devil, let us be aware and vigilant and heed the warning of the author of the proverb.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Follow the Lord

### Day #189 Wisdom is better than gold

If you were asked to choose between a large amount of money and God, what would you pick?
Would you be satisfied with all the wealth and comforts this world can offer? I don‚Äôt think that perfect health, wealth, beauty, stuff, or people can ever satisfy us, if it was so then all the rich people would be happy all the healthy people would be joyful, and all the beautiful people would feel whole.
We all are created to be loved by God and only in Him will we be complete.
Now the path to the whole life/holy life is what prepares us to be complete/whole/satisfied/fulfilled. It is the journey that shapes us like a diamond that needs to be chiseled and polished to shine its best, we are being formed in our spiritual lives every day, through every challenge/situation/difficulty/sickness/God‚Äôs word/God experience.
One reason for us not growing in our spiritual lives could be ‚Äúwe love sin too much‚Äù. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, we need to be able to hate our sin, rather than take pleasure in it ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier said than done ‚Äì because our flesh is drawn towards gratifying ourselves.
We need to seek wisdom more than we seek things of this world, we need to make an effort to learn from the Lord. Seek instruction rather than silver and knowledge rather than gold. We should dwell in prudence and find knowledge in discretion.
However, all this knowledge should be governed by wisdom and a willing spirit.
Knowledge is knowing stuff, but wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge and a willing spirit is what helps us to do the things we are called to. ‚Äì Michael Eltham ü§£
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength. Pr 8:10-14
When we seek wisdom we will have counsel, insight, and strength to do the will of the Lord
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

2 Kings 23:1-25
Hilkiah found the Book of the Law (2 Kings 22:8), Shaphan read it to King Josiah (2 Kings 22:10) and a great spiritual revival took place in the whole country.  All idols (Baal, Asherah, Molech, etc.) and evil practices were destroyed and people were restored back to God by renewing the Covenant.

We too are called to do the same.
Let us stop idolizing our jobs, money, positions, possessions, talents, etc.
Then let us renew our Covenant with God by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) and the Eucharist (Communion) regularly.
Let us reform ourselves first, and then reform the little community around us by reading the Word of God and sharing it with our families, friends and neighborhood.

2 Kings 23:29
Inspite of all the spiritual revival which Josiah brought about, in the end he made a mistake by taking his own decision, instead of consulting God, before deciding to go into battle, thus causing his own destruction.

Whenever there‚Äôs an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is always strong resistance from the demonic.
When things start going well for us and we are walking with the Lord, Satan steps in with flatteries and extra appreciation thus making us a little over-confident.  We gradually develop pride and end up in Satan‚Äôs team.  Satan does it so smoothly that we don‚Äôt even realize when and how we ended up walking with him.

Let us therefore be guided by God‚Äôs Word in all we do and say and apply it to our lives every day.  Let us not make the error of misusing God‚Äôs Word to fit our agenda.

### Judah is Overrun

[![Judah is Overrun](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day190.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tEhRzERfU8Q "Judah is Overrun")

### Day #190 Lack of Wisdom can lead to our downfall

Wisdom was the first thing that was created even before the heavens and the earth was created. Wisdom is so critical, that the lack of it can lead to our downfall. We need to constantly attune to wisdom, and ask the Holy Spirit to lead us ‚Äì for Wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. Happy is the one who is led by the Holy Spirit, who carefully listens to the voice of God.
‚ÄúAnd now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord; but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death.‚Äù Prov 8:32-34
We see the example of King Josiah ‚Äì who is this good King who is instrumental in celebrating Passover like never before.
‚ÄúNo Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Judah has kept such a Passover‚Äù 2 Ch 35:18
Even though he was such a good King he failed to listen to wisdom, to God. Now Pharaoh Neco was at war and King Josiah went out against him.
But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, ‚ÄúWhat have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you.‚Äù But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, ‚ÄúTake me away, for I am badly wounded.‚Äù So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 2 Ch 35:21-24
What a tragic mistake, If only King Josiah would have listened to the warning that God gave him. Judah would have had a good king for years to come. Another lesson to learn is the Lord can use your enemies to speak to you, we notice that Pharaoh Neco was the one who spoke God‚Äôs instruction. We need to have open ears to listen to the voice of God.
Let us try to attune our hearts to the Holy Spirit, and make every attempt to hear the voice of God. Have an open ear, always trying to listen to God ‚Äì God can use even our enemies to speak to us, we can hear his instruction from the place we least expect it. Just try to listen and he will speak. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Babylonian Exile

[![The Babylonian Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day191.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k_JQWIxEQqw "The Babylonian Exile")

### Day #191 Sometimes we may need to hit rock bottom to come to our senses

The Lord led the people out of slavery and defeated the army of Pharoah ‚Äì with a lot of Miracles and wonders. God led the people of Israel out into the wilderness ‚Äì leading them by fire by night and smoke by day ‚Äì gave them leaders like Moses, Joshua, and many judges and Kings. The Lord gave them bread from heaven and provided them with everything they needed on their journey to the promised land. The Lord fought for them and defeated all nations they encountered and finally, they were given this promised land ‚Äì a land flowing with milk and honey. The Lord also gave them the most important thing ‚Äì a beautiful temple to worship ‚Äì built by King Solomon. Instead of living the good life ‚Äì they turned away from God to idolatry, were misled by the Kings, and the Israelite tribes fought against each other and were divided. Finally, they are Exiled to Babylon ‚Äì the temple is being looted and all the silver and gold are taken away as spoil.
Sometimes we need to hit rock bottom in our lives to truly appreciate the love of God. We take things for granted and assume that everything will go well with us ‚Äì we just ignore God and our relationship with him.
We are like the prodigal son who asks for his share of the property and does not want to have anything to do with the father. We are like Israelites who entered the promised land but forgot God. Just like the Prodigal son lost all his money and had to work at a pigsty or the like the Israelites who were taken prisoners by the Babylonians and the promised land plundered, with only the poor people left behind. We may experience great loss in our lives ‚Äì but this is not God wanting to take revenge. It‚Äôs God‚Äôs invitation to come back to him ‚Äì to run to the arms of the father ‚Äì to rebuild the temple in the promised land.
Maybe it‚Äôs time where someone like King Cyrus will proclaim that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go back and rebuild the house of the Lord‚Äù that "Your life will be restored"
‚ÄúThus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him! Let him go up.‚Äù 2 Ch 36:23
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

2 Chronicles 36:14-23
Due to the people‚Äôs disobedience to God‚Äôs commandments and desecration of the Temple, God allowed their enemy (the Chaldeans) to conquer Israel, slaughter many and take the survivors into exile until they completed their punishment period, that is, 70 years.   Although God had left them He did not abandon them.  He promised to take them back to their land (Israel) after the completion of 70 years.  At the end of the 70 years God announced the fulfillment of his prophecy by stirring up the heart of a pagan king (Cyrus) and gave the Jews some hope for the future.

Physical exile was meant to teach the people how mortal sins cause us to be spiritually exiled from God.  Mortal sins open the door to the devil thus bringing in suffering and misery.  Only repentance and obedience to God can take us back to Him.
Exile was like prison for Israel.  When they completed their sentence they would be released.

### The Prophet Isaiah

### Day #192 Corporal works of Mercy ‚Äì Bury the dead

In today‚Äôs reading of Tobit, we see that Tobit is almost risking his life to bury the dead. It can seem kind of unnecessary to us because the person is dead. But it‚Äôs an act of showing respect for life, all life comes from God and the soul returns to God. The Catholic Church recognizes that this as an important part of one‚Äôs faith and hence is part of the 7-corporal works of mercy, which are
Feed the Hungry
Give Drink to the Thirsty
Clothe the Naked
Shelter the Homeless
Visit the Sick
Visit the Imprisoned
Bury the Dead
Tobit was one zealous person doing this mercy work, he would steal the bodies and give them a good burial. Even though he received many warnings he did not stop. In one incidence he was about to have a feast ‚Äì the food was spread out, and with the abundance of food he wanted to invite any of his people who may need a meal. His son found an Israelite strangled ‚Äì Tobit left his feast meal to go and do this act of Mercy.
During the time of Covid, many heroic people risked their lives like Tobit to give the dead a proper burial. Let us cultivate this habit of showing concern towards the family who lost a loved one, by going to the funeral, sending the family a card/flowers, or better still offering a Mass for the soul of the dearly departed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 192 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 1:2-20
Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed during the time of Abraham, which was more than a thousand years before Isaiah was born. But although Isaiah was preaching to Jerusalem he referred to them as Sodom and Gomorrah.

The towns of Sodom and Gomorrah were blessed with flourishing prosperity, but the people squandered all their blessings by doing evil. Israel was doing the same.

The Israelites were the most blessed people on earth. They were the people to whom the Law of God was given, they had the wisdom of Solomon, and they had the Davidic kingdom of God but they squandered all their blessings on false gods, led immoral lives and ignored the Almighty God by ignoring His desire completely. They performed robotic rituals and ensured that they did everything that the Mosaic Law commanded, but they ignored the oppression and suffering of the widows and orphans whom they were supposed to care for like their own.
Eventually the children followed the example of the elders.

But Israel's story is our story.

Like them we too sometimes attend Mass like robots, we pray like robots, we observe all the prescribed festivals, etc. and we may be checking everything on the list, but we live unholy lives, we rarely go for Confession, we spend our money on false gods (entertainment, luxury goods, etc.),  and we ignore God's desire by ignoring the less fortunate ones around us.

God wants us to love Him by leading holy lives and caring for the less fortunate ones around us. Thus our physical life will reflect our spiritual life and will be a blessing to all around us.

Isaiah 2:2‚Äì5
Isaiah was shown a vision of a peaceful world in the future where all people would be walking towards the new Jerusalem (the Church).  A world where criminals would discard their weapons and take up agricultural tools; a world where there would be no war, but only peace because, through the sacraments, the Holy Spirit would empower the people to forgive their offenders and live the law of love.
This was God‚Äôs plan for the new earth after the Resurrection of Jesus.

Let us therefore live in obedience to God and walk in His light so that God can use us to bring Heaven down on earth.

### The Book of Tobit

### Day #193 Archangel Raphael (God heals)- healing of sight to Tobit

One way to remember the Archangels is as below
‚ÄúThe Archangel of light, sight, and fight ‚Äì Archangel of light is Gabriel, sight is Raphael and fight is Michael ‚Äú
We see a mention of Archangel Raphael in the book of Tobit,
At that very moment, the prayers of both of them were heard in the glorious presence of God. So Raphael was sent to heal both of them: Tobit, by removing the white films from his eyes, so that he might see God‚Äôs light with his eyes; and Sarah, daughter of Raguel, by giving her in marriage to Tobias son of Tobit, and by setting her free from the wicked demon Asmodeus. Tobit 3:16,17
We usually do not pay much attention to the presence of angels or their actions. Almost everything in our lives involves angles, we have a guardian angel always with us, when we pray, our prayers are carried by angels and presented to God. When God wants to bring us healing or work Miracles or do anything ‚Äì Angels are dispatched with work orders. The angles are God‚Äôs army of workers, just doing the will of God. Raphael is one of the three Archangels ‚Äì who is attributed to healing and deliverance. We see Raphael is instrumental in the healing of Tobit‚Äôs sight and deliverance of Raquel. The angel's name Raphael means ‚ÄúGod heals‚Äù.
Although only the archangels Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name in the New Testament, the Gospel of John speaks of the pool at Bethesda, where many ill people rested, awaiting the moving of the water. "An angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under" John 5:1-4. Because of the healing powers often linked to Raphael, the angel spoken of is generally associated with St. Raphael, the Archangel.
Raphael is also attributed to ‚ÄúHappy meetings‚Äù because we read in Tobit that he made the meeting of Tobit and Sarah happen soon after Tobit received his sight back. Tobias was next in line - entitled to marry Sarah.
At the same time that Tobit returned from the courtyard into his house, Sarah daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.
We can always pray to St Raphael for our healing and for those seeking life partners.
O Raphael, lead us towards those we are waiting for, those who are waiting for us! Raphael, Angel of Happy Meetings, lead us by the hand towards those we are looking for! May all our movements, all their movements, be guided by your Light and transfigured by your Joy. Angel Guide of Tobias, lay the request we now address to you at the feet of Him on whose unveiled Face you are privileged to gaze. Lonely and tired, crushed by the separations and sorrows of earth, we feel the need of calling to you and of pleading for the protection of your wings, so that we may not be as strangers in the Province of Joy, all ignorant of the concerns of our country. Remember the weak, you who are strong--you whose home lies beyond the region of thunder, in a land that is always peaceful, always serene, and bright with the resplendent glory of God. Amen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
