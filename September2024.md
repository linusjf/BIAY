### The Faithfulness of Daniel

[![The Faithfulness of Daniel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day245.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YyoM96UAEYw "The Faithfulness of Daniel")

### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you not worship Bel?‚Äù 5 He answered, ‚ÄúBecause I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.‚Äù
6 The king said to him, ‚ÄúDo you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?‚Äù 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, ‚ÄúDo not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.‚Äù
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, ‚ÄúIf you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.‚Äù Daniel said to the king, ‚ÄúLet it be done as you have said.‚Äù
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, ‚ÄúSee, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.‚Äù 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king‚Äôs signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, ‚ÄúAre the seals unbroken, Daniel?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúThey are unbroken, O king.‚Äù 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, ‚ÄúYou are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!‚Äù
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. ‚ÄúLook at the floor,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand notice whose footprints these are.‚Äù 20 The king said, ‚ÄúI see the footprints of men and women and children.‚Äù
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, ‚ÄúYou cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.‚Äù 25 Daniel said, ‚ÄúI worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.‚Äù The king said, ‚ÄúI give you permission.‚Äù
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, ‚ÄúSee what you have been worshiping!‚Äù
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, ‚ÄúCome, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.‚Äù*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

### Rejoice in Doing Good

[![Rejoice in Doing Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day246.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mwmk2EmKf8M "Rejoice in Doing Good")

### Day #246 God does not resentfully help us but rejoices in doing good to us.

When we commit sin our natural tendency is to stop praying or to run away from God. One tries to avoid a God encounter because we have hurt our all-loving God. We feel that God is upset with us and is very angry with us, we try to associate the experience that we had as children. Children tend to avoid their parents when they have made a mistake, knowing that they will be punished for the wrongs. This has been written so deep into us that we try to run away from God when we sin, we try to hide like Adam and Eve. We try to cover up our shame and hide our mistakes from God, but God knows it all. God knows us better than we know ourselves, we may run but can never escape God.
On the contrary, we should run to God, because He is a loving, merciful, and forgiving God. When Adam and eve committed sin, they were hiding but God came in search of them. Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the Lost sheep. When Peter denied Jesus 3 times, Jesus did not rebuke him but offered him another chance, he entrusted him with being the shepherd of the flock again. Our God is different from anything we have ever experienced, God wants to forgive us and give us another chance. God does not do this out of reluctance but rejoices to do us good.
I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.Jer 32:14
There is great rejoicing when one sinner repents than over 99 who did not need to repent. God loves the sinner and understands us, Jesus took on this weak human nature and knows how frail we truly are.
The next time you need forgiveness, do not run away but run towards the Lord. He is waiting with arms wide open.
Let us then approach God‚Äôs throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:19
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 246 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 32:40
*I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The old Covenant did not have a provision for renewal because a price has to be paid by a priest, with holy blood, to make atonement, whenever God's Covenant is broken. Therefore it was not an everlasting Covenant.

The new Covenant is everlasting because Jesus, our High Priest, paid the price by offering His physical holy blood, once for all. Thereafter, whenever we break the new Covenant with our sins, God renews it through the Sacrament of Reconciliation and when we receive the sacramental Body and Blood of Christ (Communion), which was offered by an Apostolic priest, in atonement for our sins.

### True Repentance

[![True Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day247.jpg)](https://youtu.be/brdYj4UPNfw "True Repentance")

### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 ‚ÄúThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‚ÄòEvery seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.‚Äô Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 ‚ÄúTherefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô for you, declares the Lord‚Äî‚Äòfreedom‚Äô to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ‚ÄúSee, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.‚Äù John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Cut to the Heart

[![Cut to the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day248.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jJ24ExMKoFc "Cut to the Heart")

### Day #248 Does suffering make you bitter or better?

The proverb in today‚Äôs reading hits the nail on the head about suffering and testing. Fine metals are made pure by heating in the furnace and shaped by hammering when red hot. The human heart is made pure by testing and suffering.

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Prov 17:3

Today we see how the Rechabites have been faithfully following the instructions of their fathers, to not drink wine. They were testing and passed the test.

We need to ask ourselves: will we pass the test? Let‚Äôs read.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:

2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. 3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 4 I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, ‚ÄúHave some wine.‚Äù 6 But they answered, ‚ÄúWe will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‚ÄòYou shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; 7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.‚Äô 8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‚ÄòCome, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.‚Äô That is why we are living in Jerusalem.‚Äù

12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the Lord. Jer 33:1-13

In the book of Judith, we see the Israelites in distress, they have been surrounded by their enemies for 35 days now and are running low on supplies. The water in their cisterns is drying up and people are fainting on the streets due to thirst. They came to the point of giving up and wanted to surrender. They were willing to surrender and become slaves of the enemies. But then the word of the Lord came to Uzziah and he encouraged them to hold on a little longer for 5 more days.

29 Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice. 30 But Uzziah said to them, ‚ÄúCourage, my brothers and sisters! Let us hold out for five days more; by that time the Lord our God will turn his mercy to us again, for he will not forsake us utterly. 31 But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do as you say.‚Äù
32 Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their town. The women and children he sent home. In the town they were in great misery. Judith 7: 29-32

As we continue to read the book of Judith, we will see how God saves them from their enemies. The lesson to learn today from them is to keep strong in times of suffering, trusting God and knowing that we just need to hold on a little longer for help is on the way. Let us be encouraged by this story from the bible, even if we are weak and fainting and see no way out ‚Äì if we want to give in and surrender to the enemy ‚Äì we should not. Stay strong, stay brave, for you are under testing, the Lord will soon bring you help.

You are precious to the Lord like gold is precious to people. The Lord is refining you by testing. Your suffering is meant to help you grown in holiness.

But does your suffering make you bitter or better?

Don‚Äôt worry if you answered bitter, you could get better. You will have many more chances of suffering and testing and hopefully we can become better. When we encounter suffering let us praise God and offer up our suffering for those who need our prayers. Our bitter will slowly become better.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Prayer of Judith

[![Prayer of Judith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day249.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f27psD92Kv8 "Prayer of Judith")

### Day #249 Setting a deadline for our petitions is like putting God to the test.

Who said beauty, wisdom, and goodness cannot be found together in a woman, we have a heroine from the Old Testament ‚ÄúJudith‚Äù who has all these qualities.

We are all aware of the long-suffering they were going through, people are fainting due to lack of drinking water. Uzziah come up with a hack of an idea to wait for 5 more days and if God does not come to their aid, they would surrender. Judith was witnessing all this commotion and holds them to the truth.
Judith and the Elders

9 When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days, 10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town. 11 They came to her, and she said to them:
‚ÄúListen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. 12 Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs? 13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything! 14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God. 15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies. 16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading. 17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him. Judith 8:9-17

Yes, indeed we cannot set a timeline for God to work, they were setting a timeline of 5 days for God to answer their prayers. Which is nothing but putting God to the test, it‚Äôs like throwing God a challenge ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt answer our prayers in 5 days we will surrender. Judith in her wisdom brought out this aspect of testing God and saved the Israelites from going into slavery.
Sometimes we need to be aware that we are putting God to the test when we pray prayers like, ‚ÄúPlease give me a job within this month‚Äù or ‚ÄúHeal me at service today‚Äù.

Our attitude should be more like ‚Äì ‚ÄúLord I offer my prayer to you and know you can do things instantly but if you want me to bear this cross longer so be it."

We should not be making prayers like bribes ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you answer this petition, I will donate $1000‚Äù.
Our prayers should be prayers of faith, thanking God for what we are asking for, and knowing that He will grant what is best for us in His time. -Michael Eltham

We should stop putting deadlines to our prayers to be answered, building character, faith and trust is more important than results.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
