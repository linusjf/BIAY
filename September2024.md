### The Faithfulness of Daniel

[![The Faithfulness of Daniel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day245.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YyoM96UAEYw "The Faithfulness of Daniel")

### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” 5 He answered, “Because I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.”
6 The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?” 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.” Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, “See, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.” 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.” 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!”
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. “Look at the floor,” he said, “and notice whose footprints these are.” 20 The king said, “I see the footprints of men and women and children.”
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.” 25 Daniel said, “I worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 245 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, “Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

### Rejoice in Doing Good

[![Rejoice in Doing Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day246.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mwmk2EmKf8M "Rejoice in Doing Good")

### Day #246 God does not resentfully help us but rejoices in doing good to us.

When we commit sin our natural tendency is to stop praying or to run away from God. One tries to avoid a God encounter because we have hurt our all-loving God. We feel that God is upset with us and is very angry with us, we try to associate the experience that we had as children. Children tend to avoid their parents when they have made a mistake, knowing that they will be punished for the wrongs. This has been written so deep into us that we try to run away from God when we sin, we try to hide like Adam and Eve. We try to cover up our shame and hide our mistakes from God, but God knows it all. God knows us better than we know ourselves, we may run but can never escape God.
On the contrary, we should run to God, because He is a loving, merciful, and forgiving God. When Adam and eve committed sin, they were hiding but God came in search of them. Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the Lost sheep. When Peter denied Jesus 3 times, Jesus did not rebuke him but offered him another chance, he entrusted him with being the shepherd of the flock again. Our God is different from anything we have ever experienced, God wants to forgive us and give us another chance. God does not do this out of reluctance but rejoices to do us good.
I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.Jer 32:14
There is great rejoicing when one sinner repents than over 99 who did not need to repent. God loves the sinner and understands us, Jesus took on this weak human nature and knows how frail we truly are.
The next time you need forgiveness, do not run away but run towards the Lord. He is waiting with arms wide open.
Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:19
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 246 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 32:40
*I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The old Covenant did not have a provision for renewal because a price has to be paid by a priest, with holy blood, to make atonement, whenever God's Covenant is broken. Therefore it was not an everlasting Covenant.

The new Covenant is everlasting because Jesus, our High Priest, paid the price by offering His physical holy blood, once for all. Thereafter, whenever we break the new Covenant with our sins, God renews it through the Sacrament of Reconciliation and when we receive the sacramental Body and Blood of Christ (Communion), which was offered by an Apostolic priest, in atonement for our sins.

### True Repentance

[![True Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day247.jpg)](https://youtu.be/brdYj4UPNfw "True Repentance")

### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.” John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Cut to the Heart

[![Cut to the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day248.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jJ24ExMKoFc "Cut to the Heart")

### Day #248 Does suffering make you bitter or better?

The proverb in today’s reading hits the nail on the head about suffering and testing. Fine metals are made pure by heating in the furnace and shaped by hammering when red hot. The human heart is made pure by testing and suffering.

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Prov 17:3

Today we see how the Rechabites have been faithfully following the instructions of their fathers, to not drink wine. They were testing and passed the test.

We need to ask ourselves: will we pass the test? Let’s read.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:

2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. 3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 4 I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Have some wine.” 6 But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; 7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.’ 8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”

12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the Lord. Jer 33:1-13

In the book of Judith, we see the Israelites in distress, they have been surrounded by their enemies for 35 days now and are running low on supplies. The water in their cisterns is drying up and people are fainting on the streets due to thirst. They came to the point of giving up and wanted to surrender. They were willing to surrender and become slaves of the enemies. But then the word of the Lord came to Uzziah and he encouraged them to hold on a little longer for 5 more days.

29 Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice. 30 But Uzziah said to them, “Courage, my brothers and sisters! Let us hold out for five days more; by that time the Lord our God will turn his mercy to us again, for he will not forsake us utterly. 31 But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do as you say.”
32 Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their town. The women and children he sent home. In the town they were in great misery. Judith 7: 29-32

As we continue to read the book of Judith, we will see how God saves them from their enemies. The lesson to learn today from them is to keep strong in times of suffering, trusting God and knowing that we just need to hold on a little longer for help is on the way. Let us be encouraged by this story from the bible, even if we are weak and fainting and see no way out – if we want to give in and surrender to the enemy – we should not. Stay strong, stay brave, for you are under testing, the Lord will soon bring you help.

You are precious to the Lord like gold is precious to people. The Lord is refining you by testing. Your suffering is meant to help you grown in holiness.

But does your suffering make you bitter or better?

Don’t worry if you answered bitter, you could get better. You will have many more chances of suffering and testing and hopefully we can become better. When we encounter suffering let us praise God and offer up our suffering for those who need our prayers. Our bitter will slowly become better.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Prayer of Judith

[![Prayer of Judith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day249.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f27psD92Kv8 "Prayer of Judith")

### Day #249 Setting a deadline for our petitions is like putting God to the test.

Who said beauty, wisdom, and goodness cannot be found together in a woman, we have a heroine from the Old Testament “Judith” who has all these qualities.

We are all aware of the long-suffering they were going through, people are fainting due to lack of drinking water. Uzziah come up with a hack of an idea to wait for 5 more days and if God does not come to their aid, they would surrender. Judith was witnessing all this commotion and holds them to the truth.
Judith and the Elders

9 When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days, 10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town. 11 They came to her, and she said to them:
“Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. 12 Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs? 13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything! 14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God. 15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies. 16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading. 17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him. Judith 8:9-17

Yes, indeed we cannot set a timeline for God to work, they were setting a timeline of 5 days for God to answer their prayers. Which is nothing but putting God to the test, it’s like throwing God a challenge – if you don’t answer our prayers in 5 days we will surrender. Judith in her wisdom brought out this aspect of testing God and saved the Israelites from going into slavery.
Sometimes we need to be aware that we are putting God to the test when we pray prayers like, “Please give me a job within this month” or “Heal me at service today”.

Our attitude should be more like – “Lord I offer my prayer to you and know you can do things instantly but if you want me to bear this cross longer so be it."

We should not be making prayers like bribes – “If you answer this petition, I will donate $1000”.
Our prayers should be prayers of faith, thanking God for what we are asking for, and knowing that He will grant what is best for us in His time. -Michael Eltham

We should stop putting deadlines to our prayers to be answered, building character, faith and trust is more important than results.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 249 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 38:4–6
*Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”  King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”  So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.*

Jeremiah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Some centuries later Jesus also went through a similar experience.
Like Jeremiah and Jesus, Christians also may have to go through a similar experience during their lifetime.
When the Word of God is preached the evil one gets very disturbed and he therefore stirs up his disciples to block the Word from reaching millions of people by getting rid of the preachers.

### Final Wave of Exile

[![Final Wave of Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day250.jpg)](https://youtu.be/U8IW-EHokos "Final Wave of Exile")

### Day #250 Choosing God’s will or the easy way out?

We are reading about the final exile of the Israelites, the fall of Jerusalem. Now the captain of the guard of Jeremiah must have seen something in him or must have recognized that this prophet is truly from God. He offers to take Jeremiah with him and to keep him comfortable.
2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster; 3 and now the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said, because all of you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice. Therefore this thing has come upon you. 4 Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you; but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. 5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. 6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land. Jeremiah 40:2-6
If anyone of us were given this offer, we may have chosen to go with the captain. Now Jeremiah was not a person to seek out an easy life, all he wanted to do was "the will of God". He decides to stay with the poor in desolate Jerusalem.
Let us learn a life lesson from this prophet Jeremiah, that the most important thing to do is the will of the Lord. In life, we will be given multiple options, and more often than not, we tend to pick what is easy over the right thing to do.
Let’s look at a couple of examples.

1. If you go to the store and your kid hides a toy and does not check it out, would you go back to the store and tell them what happened or just say “these stores overcharge us – it’s good we got to take something from them”
2. If your teenage kid comes back to you and says she is pregnant, would you allow her to have an abortion or ask her to raise the kid and learn a life lesson.
   Hopefully, we will have the courage to do the will of God, when we are faced with these hard decisions in our lives.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judith and Holofernes

[![Judith and Holofernes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day251.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vPnfDIwTaZY "Judith and Holofernes")

### Day #251 Drunkenness can cause you to let your guard down.

It’s worth reading the whole episode on how Judith kills Holofernes.
Judith Attends Holofernes’ Banquet
10 On the fourth day Holofer′nes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite any of his officers. 11 And he said to Bago′as, the eunuch who had charge of all his personal affairs, “Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us. 12 For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us.” 13 So Bago′as went out from the presence of Holofer′nes, and approached her and said, “This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnez′zar.” 14 And Judith said, “Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!” 15 So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman’s finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofer′nes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bago′as for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.
16 Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofer′nes’ heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her. 17 So Holofer′nes said to her. “Drink now, and be merry with us!” 18 Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born.” 19 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared. 20 And Holofer′nes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.
13 When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bago′as closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master’s presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long. 2 So Judith was left alone in the tent , with Holofer′nes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.
3 Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bago′as. 4 So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, “O Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. 5 For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us.”
6 She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofer′nes’ head, and took down his sword that hung there. 7 She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!” 8 And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body. 9 Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holofer′nes’ head to her maid, 10 who placed it in her food bag. Judith 12: 10-16, 13:1-10
Although it’s not an explicit sin to drink alcohol, alcohol can open the door to other sins. When you consume alcohol in excess you let down your guard and would do things you wouldn’t normally do. Although drinking alcohol is not a sin, drunkenness is a grave sin that will not permit you to go to heaven.
Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor: 9,10
We read in today’s readings that Holofernes drank much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born. This led to him letting his guard down and gave Judith an opportunity to strike his head with a sword and kill him.
Let us all pray for the virtue of temperance, it the virtue that will help us avoid any kind of excess whether it be food drink or tobacco.
The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. CCC 2290
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Queen of Heaven

[![Queen of Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day252.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XJfmBfWX_7Y "Queen of Heaven")

### Day #252 The Queen of Heaven

As we read Jeremiah, the goddess with the title “Queen of Heaven” comes up a lot. Given the fact that the catholic church gives Mary the title “Queen of heaven” can be confusing. If you take the title out of context then it can seem confusing. However there are many differences that are very obvious, first Mary is not a goddess she is human. The Queen of heaven spoken about in Jeremiah was an idol, it’s talking about idol worship.

6 “As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 18 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”

The Israelites stopped listening to the word of God that Jeremiah spoke and even stopped burning incense to the idol. They are confused that they are in a poor state because they stopped burning incense to the idol. However, the real reason is that they stopped worshiping the true God of Israel.

When it comes to the title of Queen of heaven for Mary, the first thing is she is not a goddess or an idol. She is just a human being chosen by God to partner with God to bring salvation to the world. She is the daughter of Abba father, the spouse of the Holy Spirit and the mother of Jesus. In the Jewish kingdom, the queen was always the mother, because the kings had many wives.

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.

And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus’ dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1

May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are “I am a handmaid of the Lord”, “My soul magnifies the Lord”, and “Do as he says, listen to him”. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Queen of heaven intercede for us as we try to understand scripture.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 252 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 43:1-3
*When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to settle there’; but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.”*

The Jews did not want to obey God's Word and they were afraid to accuse God's anointed prophet (Jeremiah) directly so they accused Jeremiah's secretary, Baruch, of inciting Jeremiah to give them false messages thus making him a false prophet.  This was the only way they could defend their disobedience to God's Word.  This was a hypocritical defence on their part because earlier they had taken an oath that they would obey the Lord always, irrespective of whether the message was easy or difficult to follow (Jeremiah 42:5-6).

Like those Jews, sometimes we too twist the wrong to make it look like the right so that we can defend our wrongdoings, and thus we make the good ones look like the bad ones.

Jeremiah 43:13
*He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt.*

An obelisk is a tapering stone pillar, typically having a square or rectangular cross section, set up as a monument or landmark.  It was a symbol of the fertility of Egypt.

Jeremiah 44:1-30
A dispute broke out as to why the city of Jerusalem had been defeated in battle (v. 2-3).  One side (Jeremiah) declared that it was punishment from Yahweh (God) for the sinners who had worshipped the false Queen of Heaven; while another side (the Israelites) insisted that military defeat occurred because people had stopped worshipping the Queen of Heaven.
The Queen of Heaven was most probably the false goddess Astarte, because the Mesopotamians worshipped the same goddess by offering baked cakes, but they called her “Ishtar.”

It was the idolatry of the people that brought devastation to the nation and their lives, not the cessation of idolatry.

God wants us to worship Him by following a liturgical pattern, which includes offering to Him incense and baked cakes/wafers and pouring out libations to Him as a perpetual statute until the end of time (Exodus 29:38-42).  The Israelites were following the same liturgical pattern but to worship the false goddess (v.17 & 19).
God is a loving Father and therefore He provides us with our daily needs irrespective of whether we ask Him or not, just as our earthly father would provide for us even if we were unproductive or disobedient.  It is not Satan or the false gods who provide for our survival.

The Israelites connected their earthly pain and gain with the deity they worshipped, but the spiritual reality is opposite.

When we walk on the right path towards God’s Kingdom, worshipping the living God and obeying all His Commandments, Satan is not happy and therefore he works 24x7 to destroy our souls by destroying our peace and happiness with persecution and/or constant suffering (Revelation 12:17), in and out of our homes, to mislead us into believing that our misfortunes are due to the living God who we worship.  But God allows Satan to create those problems and sufferings in our lives to heal us spiritually.
On the other hand, when we walk on the wrong path Satan is very pleased and therefore he will not create any major crisis in our lives so that we are comfortable and happy.  He may create small problems in our lives to mislead us into believing that those are the crosses which Jesus wants us to carry and we start believing that we are walking on the right path.

If we focus on our earthly peace and happiness, we end up making wrong decisions and moving forward on the wrong path, which is exactly what Satan wants us to do.
The Israelites were making the same mistake.

The people attributed their prosperity to the queen of Heaven when, in reality, it was God who was blessing them with prosperity.

Sometimes we too are like those people.
We attribute our success to our benefactors on earth and we forget that it is God who makes it possible for them to help us prosper.  We go out of our way to give them so much importance that we won't even think twice about cancelling our time with God (Sunday Mass, daily prayers, etc.) to attend to our benefactors and please them.

### Lamentations of Jeremiah

[![Lamentations of Jeremiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day253.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SDKW8fEUP44 "Lamentations of Jeremiah")

### Day #253 Let our lamentations be prayers to Christ.

As we read the book of lamentations, we can only imagine the suffering that Baruch experienced. It is not just statements of the bad situations but it’s more like prayers rising up to God.

“See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. ” Lam 1:20

When you see your children in need of something and we cannot do anything to help them, it breaks every parent's heart. The children of Israel are destitute and there is no one who can comfort them.

“This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”
Our usual response when we go through suffering is “why me Lord” or "What did I do wrong" or we end up focused on the suffering and say "Earlier It was much better", "I was able to do this/that" or "I should not have done this or that" .

Suffering on earth is inevitable and everyone will go through various suffering on earth. We have to train ourselves to accept suffering, to voice our prayers to the Lord, to be able to lament and offer up our sufferings for the salvation of souls. We should not only focus on the why of things or how to get out of suffering, but we have to be able to live in suffering and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort us when we go through difficult times.

Difficult times make us stronger, and the Lord is always with us. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, so don’t hesitate to lament and talk to the Lord about those hard things you are facing.

Ps 34: 18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
We should unite our suffering to the suffering of Christ, for the salvation of the world.
12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 1 Pet 4: 12-13

We should not be surprised that we have suffering in our lives, we should rejoice that we are able to participate in the sufferings of Christ. Even if the suffering seems like a lot, we need to remember that the Lord will not permit anything we cannot handle, and there will always be a way out. So let us accept our sufferings, lament and pray, and be united to Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judgment of Nations

[![Judgment of Nations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day254.jpg)](https://youtu.be/AHlUaRhb2Mc "Judgment of Nations")

### Day #254 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing personal opinion.

Have you ever met those kinds of people, who want their voices heard? They don’t respect the conversation or the person but would cut you off and say only what they want. These are the people who have an opinion and don’t want to change it at any cost. Having an argument with such people is meaningless for they don’t want to understand or listen – they just want to voice their opinions. They will even twist the truth to win an argument. I’m sure you have a list of people who fall under this category, and if you find yourself on the list don’t worry the Holy Spirit will help you.
Here is some practical advice from the book of James.

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. James 1:19

Let us become good listeners, let us not be quick to judge but take time to listen, understand, ask questions, and pray about everything. We should be slow to react, slow to reply and prudent in what we speak.
Words are like bullets, once shot they will never come back.
Take your time to polish every word before you speak.

We are God’s children and our words carry weight, just as God’s words bring action even our words can affect positively or negatively. We should be very careful what we say for every word we speak is recorded, we will need to give an account of every careless word we speak.

Matthew 12:36 “But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an account for it in the day of judgement.”

Let us clean up our speech, let us speak words that we are comfortable speaking to God. Let us stop all hate speech, gossip, slander, negative talk, and mean words. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen, let us understand and not just speak our heads off. Let our words be words of love and care, words that will lift up people, and that will build community.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Hard Seasons

[![Hard Seasons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day256.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qZ_Bi8I-VXA "Hard Seasons")

### Day 256 The Lord is a strong tower

The safest place in this world is in the arms of Abba Father. There are so many dangers that we face in our life, right from the time we are born till we die – there are dangers on all sides. We can meet with an accident, be part of a shooting on the road, we can get infected by a dangerous virus, can lose our job and livelihood. There are so many things that can go wrong, and bad things can happen to us. There is no need to fear everything around us all that is needed is for us to run to safety, for the Lord is a strong tower those who run to Him will be safe.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe. Prov 18:10
The key is "run to God" and to stay in the presence of the Lord, to stay in friendship with God.

You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 2 will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.” 3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence; 4 he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. 5 You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day, 6 or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, or the destruction that wastes at noonday. Ps 91:1-6

We need to live in the shelter of God and abide in the shadow of the Almighty. We can find refuge under his wings and God’s faithfulness will be our shield and buckler. Even if we are faithless the Lord will be faithful and protect us from all harm and danger.
God will put his angels in charge of us and they will patrol around us – we will not even dash our foot against the stone, and not even a hair will be lost unless the Lord permits it.

11For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. 12 On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone. Ps 91:11,12

And

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. Ps 34: 7
Let us not fear, as we have angels around us protecting us from all harm and danger.

I met with two accidents in my life and on both occasions – I did not get seriously hurt.
I am sure that God placed angels around me and protected me at the time of those accidents. It’s also important to recognize that we have been saved from many accidents in life even without our own knowledge.
So let us all run to the Lord our strong tower and be safe in His arms.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Choose to Love

[![Choose to Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day257.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JqRK-YQxun8 "Choose to Love")

### Day 257 We should try to love our extended family

The book of Obadiah is the only 1-chapter book of the Old Testament. One of the main things that come up is the enmity between distant family. Jacob and Esau fought and reconciled – however, their descendants grew strangely apart.

For the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob,
shame shall cover you,
and you shall be cut off forever.
11 On the day that you stood aside,
on the day that strangers carried off his wealth,
and foreigners entered his gates
and cast lots for Jerusalem,
you too were like one of them.
12 But you should not have gloated over your brother
on the day of his misfortune;
you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah
on the day of their ruin;
you should not have boasted
on the day of distress. Ob 1:10-12

This could be the challenge most of us are facing as well, loving family – especially distant family can get tough. It could be something that happened generations ago and the family ends up not talking to each other or rejoicing when the other family fails. If we have this nature of rejoicing over other people's failures, we need to check our hearts for jealousy, hatred and revenge.

Forgiveness is at the heart of the Christian life and we are able to forgive, but the wounds may be deeper.

For Example: If you grew up listening to your Mom saying that your Dad’s side of the family is very sly stay away - it could be hard to know the truth as you have been brainwashed.
Or For Example: If your single Dad told you to never reach out to your mom because she does not care about you, it could be hard for one to cross that bridge and understand both sides of the story.

We all have a complex history in our families and may never be able to under the negative wiring we have, however, all hope is not lost. We need to allow the Holy Spirit to heal us and make us better people. We should pray for a just heart, a heart that is pure and guided by the Holy Spirit. A heart that cares and does not judge or rejoice when your enemies fail.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 258 St Joseph our model

We have been journeying with the Israelites for what seems like centuries and millions of people. As we read the Genealogy of Jesus we know a few more names because of our “Bible in a year” experience. We also recognize that not everyone in the genealogy of Jesus is perfect, we read their stories, but God is able to draw a straight line with our crooked lives. We recognize that there are women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar who bore a child to her father-in-law (re-read day 20), Ruth (The Non-Jew), and Bathsheba(remarried due to King David’s sins), the ancestors of Jesus were not perfect people – however, the Lord makes all things new in Jesus.
Let us take courage when we find ourselves in sin or have bad ancestors or family. We just need to trust the Lord and do good, He will make all things new.
St Joseph was such a just and humble man, that when he was confronted with the decision to be the guardian of the Savior, he felt unworthy and decided to divorce Mary. He was instructed in a dream that it was indeed God’s plan for him to be the foster father of Jesus.
St Joseph’s dream would have been confirmed when baby Jesus received gifts from the wise men, the Gold symbolized his Royal Kingly line. The Frankincense revealed that he would be of priest and offer sacrifices, however, the Myrrh would have been the most difficult to understand and it was used to embalm the dead bodies. However, this was just symbolic of His death and resurrection. It must have been hard being baby Jesus’ parents, that’s why Mary pondered all these things in her heart.
Joseph became "the savior of the savior" when we had to flee with the Holy Family to Egypt. He protected that family in Egypt and brought them safely back when Herod died. St Joseph is given the title "the terror of demons" because even when he sleeps he communicates with God in dreams.
Let us learn from St Joseph to be humble, discerning, and docile to the will of God. Dream like St Joseph.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 258 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 1:1-17
The genealogy of Jesus has Jews and gentiles which means it needs the unity of Jews and gentiles to birth the complete Body of Christ, the Kingdom of God.
By linking Jesus to Abraham through David, Matthew wants to show his Jewish audience that Jesus is the royal Messiah, the divine Son of the promise.
David is spelt DVD in Hebrew, and the numerical value is 14 ( D=4, V=6).  That is why Matthew has shown the ancestry of Jesus to Joseph in groups of 14.
The Gospel according to Matthew was written for the Jews.

Matthew mentions four women in the genealogy.
All four women were not Jews.  They were either gentiles or associated with gentiles.
Tamar and Rahab were Canaanites, Ruth was a Moabite, the tribe with which God had forbidden the Israelites from intermarrying, and Bathsheba had been married to a Hittite before David.
Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba were not very clean in character.
Tamar’s two sons were conceived through an illicit relation with Judah;
Rahab was running an establishment of ill repute.
Bathsheba had an adulterous relation with King David.

The people of the Judah tribe were also descendants of these same four women.
Matthew was preparing the Jews to receive a Saviour who was criticized for hanging around with gentiles and sinners because they themselves were the descendants of gentiles and sinful people.  They were also the descendants of illicit relations.
Matthew also shows that Jesus came to redeem not only the Jews but also the gentiles.
Matthew also shows that Jesus was the rightful heir to the Davidic throne as Joseph’s legal son (Luke 2:21), and Mary’s biological son (Romans 1:3).

Matthew begins his genealogy from Abraham who was the Father of Judaism

The first century Jews believed that Solomon was the chosen Messiah for Israel.
Therefore, after the Resurrection of Jesus there were conflicts within Jewish families where some Jews in the family accepted Jesus and the others did not.
Matthew, being aware of the situation around him, split the genealogy of Jesus to show the Jews that if Solomon could be accepted as the Messiah even though he was an offspring of an adultrous affair, and a descendant of non-Jewish women, of which two were women of ill repute, and then why couldn't Jesus, who was born of a virgin mother, be accepted as the Messiah?

Matthew 1:20
*“Joseph son of David.”*
Joseph's father was Jacob, not David, but the angel was reminding Joseph of his royal lineage, his dynastic line, because all descendants of David were generally referred to as “sons and daughters of David.”
The angel was reminding Joseph that the Messiah was going to be from the lineage of David, and since Joseph was a descendant of David, he fitted the role as father of the Messiah.

Matthew 1:21
*“You are to name Him Jesus."*
The one who gives the name is the owner or controller of the recipient, just as God named the light “day” and darkness “night” (Genesis 1:5), the dome “sky” (Genesis 1:8), the dry land “earth” (Genesis 1:10), etc., and just as Adam named all the living creatures (Genesis 2:19-20).
Giving Joseph the authority to name Jesus meant giving Joseph the authority to be the one who controls Jesus, the Son of God, and yet Joseph never misused his authority.

Matthew 1:24-25
*When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; he took her into his home as his wife and he had no marital relations with her until she bore a son.*
Matthew’s emphasis was on the virgin birth which was according to the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:22-23).  Matthew wrote for a Jewish audience and therefore he wanted to make it known that the baby was purely from the Holy Spirit and not from Joseph.

Accepting a pregnant woman as his wife would bring Joseph a lot of shame and scorn because it would now be believed that he was the man who fathered the child before marriage, which means that Joseph had broken the law.  But Joseph was willing to sacrifice his respect to save Mary.
This is where Jesus learnt about sacrificial love.

*About Joseph.*
Joseph was called a righteous man because he was obedient to the Will of God.  He carried out his duties as a father and a spouse perfectly.
Joseph is mostly painted as an old man because most people find it hard to believe that a young man could remain chaste inspite of being married to a pretty young woman.
If we cannot agree that Joseph was a young man, then we do not know what true sacrificial love is.  That is where Jesus got His values from.
Joseph knew how to master his desires, which is why he is called "righteous."
Joseph reminds us that we can do God's work even when we are working silently in the background.

Matthew 2:12
*Then they returned to their country by another road because God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.*
The magi were experts in interpreting dreams so they knew exactly what the dream meant and how important it was.  Also, they had seen how disturbed Herod was when he heard the news of the new king.

What can we learn from the magi ?

1. They were men who read and believed the Word of God.
2. They started on a journey looking for Jesus.
3. They recognized the kingship and priesthood of the Messiah and therefore presented him with the appropriate gifts, the best of what they had.
4. They humbled themselves to worship Jesus inspite of their high position in society.
5. They obeyed God and not men.
   They were truly wise men.
   The magi were not only seekers, but, most importantly, they were finders.
   They did not stop looking for Jesus until they found Him and the star led the wise men to Jesus.
   Let us become like this special star, and guide many people to Jesus.
   Like the wise men, let us not stop looking for Jesus until we find Him.

Matthew 3:9
*“Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.”*
Our God who is leading His Kingdom on earth (His Church) today, is able to raise priests and missionaries from the stones of the Cathedral / Church.
Some years ago we didn’t even imagine that the Word of God would be preached through different online platforms, which is now made available to millions of God’s children.  God gave us the social media well in advance before Covid hit the globe.  God is magnificently guiding the evangelization ministry through social media, creating new opportunities to reach people.
Having the DNA of Abraham is not a guarantee for salvation and neither is Baptism.

Matthew 3:13-17
*Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything. During His baptism Jesus (the sinless man) was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give Him the means by which He could impart to us the Holy Spirit which we were lacking in due to original sin, and He gives the Holy Spirit to us through our Baptism.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.
God always begins a new creation with water and Spirit, a symbol of baptism (Genesis 1:2; Genesis 8:10-11; Exodus 14:22).
Likewise Jesus started the new creation with His baptism.

*And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”*
God is very pleased, not only when Jesus was baptized, but also when any human is baptized.  Baptism is a gift from God, given with love, to make us members of His family and it makes Him very happy whenever a human accepts His gift, just as it makes us happy when someone accepts our gift given with love.

Matthew 4:1-11
Satan tried to tempt Jesus because Satan wanted Jesus to abandon His mission so that humanity would be trapped in sin forever.
If Satan didn't spare the Son of God, then we have no reason to believe that Satan will spare us.

Satan promised to return to Jesus all creation which belongs to Jesus but without suffering.
Satan tempts humanity with this offer of wealth, comfort and pleasure without suffering, even today.

Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly and obey God's Commandments, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us.

Jesus was alone in the wilderness when the devil attacked Him.
The devil's strongest instrument is our isolation from family. He therefore starts by breaking families with divorce, fights for possessions, etc. and then starts working on attacking each soul separately.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.
Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Temptations are God’s way of training us for spiritual warfare.
A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.
Similarly, we cannot fight the spiritual enemy (Satan) by leading comfortable lives.

To be able to win a physical battle, a soldier of the country has to undergo constant physical training and practice of the use of physical weapons.
Similarly, to be able to win a spiritual battle, a soldier of Christ must undergo constant spiritual training to stay out of sin with daily prayer, reading the Word of God, regular repentance and reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist (Communion), etc. and practice the use of spiritual weapons (peace, love, understanding, patience, humility, kindness, generosity, etc.).

Satan offered 3 shortcuts to Jesus to increase the number of His followers.
*The first shortcut:*
*The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”*
In other words, do whatever you think is right in your eyes; no rules, forget duty, only remember your rights and your desires, etc.

*The second shortcut:*
*Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;*
In other words, humans love excitement and surprises. They love anything that makes them say "vow" even if they forget it after a week.  So perform some magic here and there to keep them entertained and they will follow you.

*The third shortcut:*
*Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”*
In other words, Theology is boring. It only talks about suffering. It encourages living in poverty. It tells you not to retaliate when someone insults or humiliates you.  So forget theology and get involved in politics in whichever field you may be, whether in school, at work, in a religious community, or anywhere else, and do whatever it takes to reach the top and have power in your hands, even if you have to hurt some people along the way.

What shortcuts do we take in our lives to increase the number of our likes, followers, viewers and subscribers?

Matthew 4:19
*I will make you fishers of men.*
Why only fishers and not hunters?
Jesus called His first disciples “fishers” because He wanted them to first focus on finding the Israelites who were scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing.  The gentiles/lost tribes, living in the woodlands, would be found later by the “hunters” (Jeremiah 16:16).  After His resurrection Jesus sent Saul/Paul on the mission to bring the gentiles/lost tribes into the Church.

### The Sermon on the Mount

[![The Sermon on the Mount](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day259.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fXSy0DsEnak "The Sermon on the Mount")

### Day 259 Do not be anxious, isn’t life more than food and clothes

At the start of the sermon on the mount, Jesus sets the scene when he goes up the mountain and sits down. In the OT going up the mountain was almost always an indication of a God experience – here the people meet God in the person of Jesus Christ. In the OT the teachers would sit down to teach – unlike in our modern culture where they stand up to preach, so when Jesus sat down, they know He will be teaching. Jesus is the new Moses who gives us the new law of love. Moses brought the ten commandments written on stone tablets and Jesus was the word of God himself - the word written on our hearts – he spoke those beautiful beatitudes – not just the law but the life – Jesus tells us what we need to do to be happy.
One thing that steels happiness is anxiety. We are a generation that is worried and anxious about too many things. We are constantly thinking about tomorrow, what we will eat and what we wear. It seems that we are overly concerned about earthly matters and achievements. We seem to forget the more important things like our soul and our prayer life.
The Lord reminds us that He is in control of our lives, He feeds us just as He feeds the birds of the air that are there today and gone tomorrow. Would not the Lord cloth us, He would cloths the lilies of the field.
25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?28 And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?
31 Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32 For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
34 “So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.
Mat 6:25-34
The best way to rid ourselves of anxiety would be to know our relationship with God. He is a Good Father who takes care of his children.
9 Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone? 10 Or if the child asks for a fish, will give a snake? 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Let us shun all our anxiety because we are children of Abba Father who cares for us. In Jesus we have this beautiful relationship – we are made bold enough to cry out “Abba Father”.
Our father in heaven will supply every need of ours, let us not forget to pray. We will receive our daily bread.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### DAY 259 By Sheila

Matthew: ln Matthew we learn to love our enemies those whom we consider unworthy of our love and affection. It is precisely in loving, the love of God surpasses way beyond human norms of acceptability. The Father's Love is given to the good and the unpleasant and is humbling. God never withdraws His Love for us just because we did something that is not right.

The Our Father we say is To God, Our Father whom we can relate to, with sheer intimacy, veering away from pagan ways of praying. Jesus wants us to come to God as a child approaches his father, a whole new way experience of Divine nearness to burst out our hearts desires.

```text
Don't worry, don't be anxious and don't be too preoccupied. Set our hearts on the Kingdom of God and all other things will be given.

Sadly, in our faith life, many tend to despise the things which require time. We have become so impatient whenever God seems to delay His response to our prayers. We are accustomed to instant life, an easy way and the urgency to wait. Thus lost the thrill of choosing the Narrow Gate which requires careful discernment, endurance and let God be God.
```

Proverbs: therefore teaches us to choose life, love, whose price is far above and encourages devotion and perseverance with a deeper loyalty.

### BIAY Day 259 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 5:1-12
Jesus is uniquely qualified to answer what happiness is because, he made us with His divine nature, so he knows what will fulfill us; and with His human nature he experienced the most perfect happiness possible, so we can follow him to the same destination.
At the dawn of our race, there was a great shipwreck, and among the things that went down with the ship was the human heart. So damaged was the human heart by the wound of original sin that its full potential for happiness and love remained largely unknown until Jesus came with the instruction manual for the human heart, namely, “the Beatitudes.”

While men were vainly seeking happiness in wealth, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are the poor in spirit.”
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the fleeting pleasures of the emotions, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are those who mourn.”
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the esteem of men, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you.”
Truly, the human heart is counterintuitive, and without Jesus we could not have found happiness on our own. We were like flies vainly seeking the light of the sun through a windowpane when the way out was an open door through the darkness right behind us.

In this sermon Jesus teaches us how to live a true Christian life.

In the old Covenant, the righteous people were blessed with material wealth and prosperity.
In the new Covenant, the righteous people may or may not be blessed with prosperity in this life but they will definitely be blessed with prosperity in Heaven if they take up their cross and endure through their suffering to the end (Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23).

Jesus showed us the meaning of the beatitudes by living His life in accordance with His teaching.  The beatitudes are a spiritual profile of Jesus Himself. He wants us to follow His example.
The devil has a million ways to drag us into his kingdom. Jesus wants us to be alert to sin in everything we do and say.

Matthew 5:3
The poor in spirit are those who are humble, and depend upon God completely for everything good, bodily and spiritual. They have three qualities in common:

> > they all trust in God to provide for their needs;
> > they are all detached from wealth or honor; and
> > they all love God more than wealth or honor.

Matthew 5:16
The sanctity of the world depends totally on the sanctity and obedience of Christians to the teachings of Christ, and not so much on the sanctity of non-Christians who have not heard of Jesus but are leading holy lives.
And when the world is sanctified, God is glorified.
Jesus did not focus only on maintaining the sanctity of His soul.  While maintaining the sanctity of His soul, Jesus focused on bringing others to God.
We too must do the same.
If we live our Christian lives in a state of grace at all times, then the world will be sanctified and God will be glorified because the percentage of faithful Christians will be far greater than the percentage of non-believers.

Jesus came to bring light to the world.
As followers of Christ we must use the scriptures to dispel our own darkness first and then the darkness in others.
If we have any confusion we can always ask the Lord for His help.

Like the Olympic Torch bearers, God required the Patriarchs to carry His light  through thousands of years across the world.
Like the Patriarchs, we too can become torch bearers and carry the light of Christ to the world around us.  We don't need to run several miles like the Olympics Torch bearers. We can do it from where we are.

We don't do good works to gain merits.
We must do good works because good works are part of God’s plan for salvation of the entire world and God uses His children to accomplish His divine plan.
When we help or pray for those in need we become the instruments through whom God works. We can enter into God's divine plan for salvation through prayer, good works or suffering.

Matthew 5:17
The old law was not perfect because it could not purify the souls of the people.
“He abolished the old (sacrifice) in order to establish the new (sacrifice)” (Hebrews 10:9).
By His life, death and resurrection, Jesus fulfilled the shadows of the old Religious Law and gives Himself to us through the sacraments to purify our souls.

Matthew 5:20
Jesus was not speaking against the scribes and Pharisees.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees was real but it was earthly, human and natural, and it was based on the Mosaic Law.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees could only discipline God's people to make them good citizens of the earthly Jerusalem.  It could not purify their conscience/souls.  But the Law of Christ makes us saints of the heavenly Jerusalem because it purifies our conscience/souls through the sacraments.
Therefore, as a new Covenant people, our righteousness must go beyond the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, not against it.

Matthew 5:21-22
The old law said “do not kill” (Exodus 20:13).
But Jesus did not just forbid murder. Murder was already forbidden in the old law.  Jesus forbade us from using harsh or insulting words when speaking to others so that our anger does not progress to hatred, hatred does not progress to revenge, and revenge does not progress to murder.  Jesus wants us to nip the evil in the bud.
It is not wrong to be angry when someone has offended us but we must not allow our anger to progress to sinful words and actions.

Matthew 5:23-24
Before offering our gift / sacrifice at the Altar, Jesus wants us to make peace with everyone around us and change our anger, hatred, enmity into love because we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor (everyone around us).
If we have anger, hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness against anyone then we cannot have union with the Lord at the Altar and all our fasting, almsgiving, prayer, etc. is all a waste.

Matthew 5: 27-32
In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church.  Physical adultery and divorce are symbols of spiritual adultery and divorce.
In a spiritually adulterous relation we (the Church) abandon our spouse (Jesus) and join with our lover (Satan) when we commit mortal sins.  Therefore, Jesus forbade adultery and divorce.

Matthew 5:38-39
*“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also;”*
If God had allowed the ancient form of justice to continue till the end of time then, at the speed with which violence is increasing in today’s world, by the end of time two thirds of humanity would probably have no eyes and teeth.
Jesus softened the law by introducing forgiveness because retaliation doesn't create peace and security around us.

Development of morality in salvation history:
After the fall of man, Cain could avenge 7 times.
Moses could avenge equal times (an eye for an eye).
Prophets preached that mercy was as important as justice.
Jesus said, "love your enemies; forget vengeance and forgive 70 times seven; leave the vengeance to God.  If enemy repents then God will forgive them too."

Due to man’s sinful nature, it took thousands of years for God to forbid retaliation totally and bring humanity down to this level.

Matthew 6:1-2
Hypocrites are not only those who make a public show of their good deeds.
When we profess our faith in Christ but don’t live our lives like Christ then we are hypocrites.
When we pray The Lord’s Prayer on one side, and live with a grudge against our offenders and speak ill about them on the other side, then we are hypocrites.

Matthew 6:5
Synagogues were places where the Law was explained to the people (Acts 13:13-16) and they were taught how to apply it to themselves in their daily lives.  They also sang the psalms.  The Jews never prayed or worshipped God in the Synagogues.  Worship was strictly reserved to be only in the official Temple where the sacrifice was offered (John 4:20).  The hypocrites prayed on the streets and in the Synagogues because those were the places where there were crowds of people and the hypocrites wanted people to see them praying.

There is no harm in praying at home with our families but additionally Jesus wants us to spend time with God in solitude, every day, just as He did.   There is also no harm in gathering with people outside homes to pray as long as we are not making a show of it for personal gain.

Matthew 6:6
Prayer is not about giving God information. It is an activity he wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.
We don't pray to God to change His mind to do our will.
We pray to God to change our mind to do His Will.
By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

Matthew 6:7-8
Jesus was condemning the heathen's/pagan's repetitive prayers because :

1. their prayers were not made to the living God.
2. their prayers did not include praise and thanksgiving to the living God.
3. their prayers did not have any repentance and request for forgiveness.
   Repetitive prayers made to the living God are not condemned by God (Daniel 3:25-45; Daniel 3:51-90; Psalm 118:1-4; Psalm 136:1-26; Matthew 26:44).
   Our prayers to the living God must always begin with praise, thanksgiving for blessings received and repentance for sins committed.  This may or may not be followed by our petitions.

Matthew 6:10
Jesus taught us to pray, “May Thy Kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done”,
But how can God's Kingdom (Heaven) come down on earth if we, Christians, remain silent and worry about our own comfort and reputation when we see people around us doing sinful things?

Matthew 6:24
*You cannot serve two masters.*
God does not want our divided attention, that is, 50% with the Church and 50% with the world.  He wants us to surrender ourselves to Him totally, which is 100%.

Matthew 6:33
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers, unless we are in a critical condition and cannot pray).
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God’s Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Matthew 7:1-5
When we remove the log from our eye, we will notice that what was in our brother's eye was only a splinter. It is not wrong to hate someone else's sins and expect them to correct themselves. But it is definitely wrong if we are only focusing on correcting others and not correcting our own errors. Our holiness must not be in comparison with other humans. Our holiness must be in comparison with Jesus, which no human can surpass but we must try to get as closer to Him, in holiness, as possible.

Matthew 7:21-23
*“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.*
What is the will of our Father in heaven?
God's Will is that we must worship Him the way He wants us to and to obey all the teachings of Christ which are:
A)  repentance (Luke 24:47);
B)  caring for others, specially the poor and needy (Matthew 9:13);
C)  serving God by serving others (Matthew 20:26-28).

*On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many deeds of power in your name?’  Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers.’*
Those people had been given the power to prophesy and perform miracles, and yet they were not allowed to enter Heaven.

That is because the Holy Spirit gives us two types of graces:
(1) charismatic or natural grace, and;
(2) sanctifying grace.
Sanctifying grace is the saving grace (Ephesians 2:8) and those who do not have this grace when they die are the ones whom Jesus says He will reject, even though the Lord may have done many good works through them through their charismatic or natural grace.
We must therefore ensure that we are in a state of grace at all times.

Matthew 7:21
*Faith and works.*
Works are not meant to earn our way to Heaven.
Every Christian has an obligation to allow the Holy Spirit in them to do good works for the growth of the Church and the salvation of the world thus becoming the salt and light of the world while they make sure they maintain their own holiness.

Matthew 7:24-25
*“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.  The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock.*
There will definitely be storms in the life of a Christian because our faith must be tested.  But the question to ask is not "will there be a storm in my life?" The question to ask is "when the storm hits my life, will I be spiritually ready for it?"

### Carrying the Cross

[![Carrying the Cross](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day260.jpg)](https://youtu.be/j6PaYtQRu34 "Carrying the Cross")

### Day 260 Faith, Healing, and carrying our cross

We read multiple healings in today’s Gospel of Matthew, one thing that is most common in all of the healings is faith. The best example is that of the centurion, even though he was not a Jew or a person who we can expect faith from, he did set the best example. He used a real-life example of how his soldier listened to every command, that just a word from Jesus would cure his servant. This is such a great revelation, it was eye-opening and even got Jesus' attention, Jesus praised the centurion's faith.
5 When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him 6 and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.” 7 And he said to him, “I will come and cure him.” 8 The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this,’ and the slave does it.” 10 When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, “Truly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith. 11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13 And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you according to your faith.” And the servant was healed in that hour. Mat 8:5-13
Jesus said that in all of Israel he never found faith like that of the centurion. The centurion recognized the divinity of Jesus. That is why we use this as the prayer before communion. When we pray “Lord I am not worthy to receive you only say the words and I shall be healed” – we are making a prayer of faith – a prayer that recognizes the divinity in the Eucharist. It is not a piece of bread that we consume, but Jesus’s body – Jesus enters the door of our bodies, the mouth. When Jesus comes into our hearts we are healed – physically, mentally and spiritually.
Although receiving healing is great and we need to have faith for it. The other thing that we need faith for is the cross, sometimes God’s will is not to heal us immediately but permit us to suffer, which will lead us closer to God. Just like healing, even the cross needs faith. We cannot carry the cross without faith, we have to deny ourselves everyday pickup our cross, and follow Him, all of this needs faith. If we only want healing and no cross we are not worthy of the Kingdom of God.
34 “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.
37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38 and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. Mat 10:34-39
Sometimes to follow Jesus we may have to pay the ultimate price of going against our family/loved ones. Our friendship with Jesus should have priority – nothing or no one should prevent us from following the Lord. No one should prevent us from loving our Lord and loving our neighbor. Our family may something not like that we spend time in prayer or may call it a waste of time. The constant nagging of family members can dampen our spirits, but we should not give up, we should pick up our cross daily and follow Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 260 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 8:1-4
Leprosy was a symbol of sin.  Leprosy separated the man from his community until he came to Jesus and asked to be healed.

If we have any sins (anger, hatred, envy, etc.) which have separated us from our community or family or relatives, let us go to Jesus today and ask Him to forgive us and heal our souls so that we can reconcile with the ones whom we have been separated from.

*And then a leper approached, did him homage, and said, “Lord, if you wish, you can make me clean.”*
The man believed that Jesus could heal him, but he surrendered himself to the Will of the Lord because he didn't know what the Lord’s Will was.

During the agony in the garden, Jesus also believed that God the Father could save Him from the torture He was to go through during His passion, but He surrendered himself to the Will of the Father.

When we pray, we ask the Lord for whatever we want because we believe that He can give it to us, but our prayers must always end with our surrender to the Will of the Lord.

*He stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, “I will do it. Be made clean.”*
By touching the leper Jesus bridged the gap between the holy and the unclean.  In the new Covenant all unclean people would be able to worship God along with the clean ones. The climax was when the Temple curtain was torn in two at the death of Jesus (Mark 15:38).

The touch was, however, only symbolic. The actual healing took place because of God’s Will and the man’s faith. God doesn't have to touch someone to heal the person. His Will is sufficient.

*".... but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the gift which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”*
Leprosy was a shadow of sin and the leper was a shadow of all sinners.
God allowed the people to be struck with leprosy, whenever they disobeyed Him, to show them how sin damages the soul.

The Israelites were consecrated to belong to God's family. A leper had to be isolated from God’s family and was also not allowed to enter the Temple until the leprosy was healed.  Quarantine from the community and Temple was to show how sin separates us from God and His heavenly family and thereby brings suffering into our lives.
Like leprosy, a sinful life also stops us from worshipping God.

Like the unclean man, when we show ourselves to the priest in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, we first go down on our knees to humble ourselves, then we confess our sins to the Lord through the Priest.
Healing the leper was a shadow of the priest giving us absolution, after forgiving us our sins, to renew the broken Covenant.

Matthew 8:5-7
*A centurion came to Jesus, and said, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.” And Jesus said to him, “I will come and cure him.”*
Inspite of knowing fully well that the centurion belonged to the occupation troops of the enemy camp, Jesus did not misuse the centurion's weak moment to make an ungodly deal with him. Jesus did not tell the centurion that He would heal the man's servant if he and his troops left their territory. On the contrary, Jesus, out of compassion, humbled Himself to go all the way to the centurion's house to heal the sick servant.
Likewise, if our enemy is in distress, we must forget our differences and reach out to them and help them without any condition.

Matthew 8:11-12
*I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”*
The kingdom of Heaven will ultimately be occupied by the gentiles who convert to the faith, more than the Jews who became Kingdom members by natural descent, because most of the Jews rejected Christ.

But that does not mean all Christians will go to Heaven.
The same also applies to the Christians who take the Kingdom for granted and choose to separate themselves from Christ with their mortal sins, thus living in disobedience to God and losing their heavenly inheritance.

Matthew 8:15
*Now Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick in bed with a fever. They immediately told Jesus about her.  He approached her, took her by her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them.*
The healing which Jesus brings is meant for serving others.  Therefore, if Jesus has healed us of any illness (physical, spiritual, emotional, etc.), it is because He wants us to start serving others.
What Jesus has done for Simon’s mother-in-law, He has done for all humanity; He has raised all of us who lay dead through our sins (Ephesians 2:5).

Matthew 8:20
*And Jesus said to him, “foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”*
Jesus has nowhere to rest because His resting place is in our hearts.

Matthew 8:23-27
This was a foreshadow of the Church.
Likewise there will be many violent storms for the Church on the celestial journey and maybe the boat will be capsized many times due to persecutions, but if we, the sailors/followers obey God’s commandments and have faith that Jesus will always be with us to the end then we will not drown.
When God is with us it doesn't mean that we will sail in a boat with no storms. It means that we have a boat which no storm can sink.

If we look at the physical side of the scene, it seems like Jesus was asleep and the disciples were awake.
But if we look at the spiritual side of the scene, Jesus was spiritually awake and the disciples were spiritually asleep.
Jesus knew that God the Father is aware of everything that happens on earth and that God is in control.  God just wants us to focus on Him and trust in Him. But the disciples forgot that God (Jesus) was right beside them.
Like the disciples, when we are going through a crisis we too feel that God is asleep.

Matthew 8:28-34
Jesus and the disciples were faced with a storm at sea on their way to Gadara (Matthew 8:23-27).  Satan knew that Jesus was going to release the demons from the possessed man at Gadara.  That is why Satan caused a storm at sea so that Jesus and his disciples would either be drowned or they would be filled with so much fear  that they would turn and go back.  But Jesus always placed His trust in God so He was not afraid.

When God has a special plan for our lives, Satan always tries to throw rocks and thorns on our path to discourage and stop us from carrying out God’s plan because he knows that every baptized child has been chosen by God for a divine purpose.

The people told Jesus to leave because they were more concerned about their material loss than their spiritual loss. They chose the pigs over Jesus.

The pigs were considered unclean and were therefore a symbol of a materialistic / sinful way of life in this world which is controlled by demons.  And those people were a shadow of those who choose a materialistic life controlled by demons instead of a spiritual life led by Jesus.  Such people will meet with their ultimate destruction.

Matthew 9:1-8
The paralytic's friends knew what he needed and they knew they couldn't heal him themselves, so, inspite of the obstacles, they brought him to Jesus.

When we know our friends are spiritually paralyzed (going away from God) it is our obligation to try our best to bring them back to God, irrespective of the difficulties and obstacles we may face.  We must not allow anyone's criticism, humiliation, negative opinion, etc. to stand in our way.

There’s no mention of whether the sick man had faith in Jesus or not, but Jesus healed the sick man because the sick man’s friends had faith in Jesus.
God will answer our prayers even if we pray for the spiritual healing of those who don’t have faith in Him.

The man came for one miracle but Jesus noticed the need for two (physical and spiritual).

Matthew 9:15
*The days will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.”*
Our bridegroom is taken away from us whenever we betray Him with our mortal sins because our sins destroy the divine life within us.

That is why we observe one hour fasting before Mass until we receive our bridegroom (Communion).

Matthew 9:18-26
This passage is about two miracles where Jesus heals a matured woman and a little girl.  The common things about both miracles were that both recipients were females in different age groups, both had a connection with the number 12, and both miracles were performed by Jesus due to someone’s faith in His power.
When the woman was healed, Jairus’s daughter died.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God’s daughter for 12 years.

If we are God’s children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during worship.

The woman was the only one of a multitude to barely touch the hem of Jesus’s garment, yet she alone was healed.

Many people stand in the long queues for Holy Communion, like that crowd bumping into Jesus, but like that woman, very few of them receive the Body of Christ (Communion) with true faith in Him.
Let us be among those few ones who receive the Lord into our hearts with true faith.

Matthew 9:27-31
This miracle was a type of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.

*The blind man went to Jesus and asked Him for mercy.*
We can receive mercy only if we go to Jesus with humility during Confession and Mass, and ask for it.

*When Jesus touched the man he received physical sight.*
When we receive the sacraments Jesus touches us and gives us the Holy Spirit to open our spiritual eyes to perceive the spiritual reality, thus taking away the blindness which covered our eyes due to sin.

*The man was able to see only because he believed.*
Similarly, spiritual healing through the sacraments will happen only if we believe that God’s grace flows through the sacraments.

Matthew 9:32-33
*After they had gone away, a demoniac who was mute was brought to him. And when the demon had been cast out, the one who had been mute, spoke;*
Today, the mute are those of us who have a tongue but do not discuss or spread the Word of God because the evil spirit inside us makes us feel embarrassed and ashamed when we do so.
Like the mute man, let us go to Jesus and ask Him to release our tongue so that we may have the courage to spread the Gospel.

Matthew 9:36
*When Jesus saw the crowds, His heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.*
Are our hearts moved with compassion for the less fortunate ones?
If we are moved, then do we make any attempt to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, etc., as Jesus commanded us to (Matthew 25:34-36)?

Matthew 10:1-4
Jesus (the new Solomon) and His 12 apostles, of which Peter was chosen to oversee them, were foreshadowed, in the old Covenant, by King  Solomon and His 12 governors/chief ministers and one Prime Minister.

Matthew 10:4
*Why did Jesus choose Judas Iscariot to be his apostle?*
To show us that :

1. all bishops and priests are not saints.
2. there is a Judas in all of us.  When we betray Jesus with our sins we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified.
3. God can call anyone to be a priest, the good ones as well as the bad ones.
4. on the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front.  Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers).
5. whatever Satan may do to destroy the Church through his Judases, from inside (through scandals, corruption, etc.) and from outside (through persecutions), the Church (the saints) will ultimately reach the promised land (Heaven).

Matthew 10:7-8
*As you go, proclaim the good news, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’  Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.*
The Gospel is the good news because it has overcome the bad news but for most people the Gospel is just "news" because they haven't focused on the bad news.
The bad news is that, due to the weakness of our souls, we are in captivity of the enemy (Satan and his minions) most of the time through the world, the flesh and the devil (1 John 1:8).  Jesus identified the devil as the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) and Satan’s goods are we humans.  Most of the time Satan and his minions succeed in getting humans to do what they know they shouldn't do, however big or small it may be, because sin is a power.  At other times Satan succeeds in tricking humans into believing his half truths and his new ideologies, etc.  Satan has a million ways to deceive humans.  That is why Michael and his angels are constantly at battle with the evil spirits (Revelation 12:7-11), both types of spirits being represented by humans on earth.

We may not be having the power to cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons physically or dramatically but with our love, generosity, kindness, etc. we can give new life to the people who have lost hope, we can help the sick and the lepers by attending to their needs, and we can help those who live in darkness to get rid of the demons in their lives (anger, hatred, revenge, greed, selfishness, loneliness, addictions, cruelty, etc.) who are holding them in bondage.

By these physical miracles Jesus was demonstrating how He was going to free us of our spiritual suffering through the sacraments and how the power of God works.
Jesus didn't come to earth to abolish evil and heal us of our physical suffering. He came to heal us of our spiritual suffering (sin) which is the cause of our physical suffering and which thwarts us in our vocation as God’s children.

Matthew 10:28
"Fear of the Lord" is not about being afraid of God like we would be in the case of a tyrant.  "Fear of the Lord" is fear of losing Him and therefore we choose to follow Him.  We must ask the Lord to give us the grace to stay close to Him always.
When we fear the Lord we will make sure that whatever we do we will do it to please Him, just as we would do to the one we love.

Matthew 10:31
*Do not be afraid.*
Whenever we face a crisis fear grips our hearts  because we have a fallen human nature, and the devil does everything he can to install fear in our hearts so that we despair and seek immediate solutions even if they are ungodly.

Jesus tells us not to fear because if God is truly in our hearts then we will leave all our worries in His hands trusting that He will eventually bring us out of the storm even if we get injured on the way out.

Matthew 10:39
*Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.*
Those who fear death are the ones who die only once.  Those who live for Christ are the ones who die a thousand deaths before they leave this world.

Whoever focuses on nourishing and saving his natural life will eventually lose his natural life as well as his eternal life because natural life is temporary and he has not prepared himself for his eternal life.

On the other hand, whoever has lost his natural life (maybe because of persecutions) because he was faithfully following Jesus, will receive eternal life because he knew which life was more important and he spent his time on earth preparing himself for eternal life, therefore he was not afraid of losing his natural life.

Matthew 10:40
Like the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:8-35), Jesus wants us to welcome priests in our homes because, by their apostolic ordination, when we welcome them we welcome Jesus and God the Father into our homes.

### DAY 260. By Sheila

Matthew: The Lord has remembered his Mercy. "Oh Lord I am not worthy to receive You but only say the Word and I shall be healed."  We often say these words right before we take Communion. What do they mean? Essentially, it is an expression of deep faith. Faith is fundamentally an adherence to the Person of Jesus, whose Words bring Life and Healing. Our faith ought to go way beyond our assent to a body of doctrinal teaching but to a relationship with the One who comes to us as a Gift to be taken, Jesus. He is God's Gift, who bore our infirmities and took on Himself, our diseases. Each time, we receive Jesus, we commit to adhere to both, His Message and His Person.
We go on to live in a World that puts premium in having things at the tip of our fingers. We want to have 'control' over the circumstances of our life. We are no strangers of fear but fear is neither good nor bad. The things we are afraid of pushes us to shout, 'Lord save us! We are lost'. We have the wrong notion that to combat fear, all we need is to summon all the courage we have but in the end, only our faith in Jesus can save us.
Jesus saw their faith. We are in front of a proof that while faith is a personal adherence to Jesus, it is at the same time communal. The paralytic was cured only because he believed but also because of the faith of those who carried him to Jesus. This should teach us the value of nourishing one another's faith life with our brothers and sisters in Community. The Lord constituted the Church as a Community to encourage and enrich one another in our pilgrim way to Him.
Vocation to Priesthood and religious life, if we fall short of workers in the Lord's Vineyard, it is also because we have lamentably failed to look for them. This task is given to all members and hence make the daring proposal to the young people we know, who may be just there, near to you and waiting for your gentle prodding.
"DO NOT BE AFRAID", repeated three times seeks a demonstrate that God will be in charge of those who follow Him and will faithfully carry out His Promise. No amount of human effort can effect change without God by Our Side. Let's head to The House of God's Love where even a strand of hair is left unharmed. Lets only believe and fear no more.
Proverbs:  The poor, foolish, sinners and all who are righteous and wise makes The Lord their refuge.

### Ornate Souls

### Day 261 Is religion boring?

Many people complain that Christianity is boring and has a bunch of rules. We hear phrases like “I tried church, it’s not for me” or “I didn’t get anything out of the sermon today”.
If one doesn’t experience anything it mostly is not a problem with the Church or the Bible or God the problem lies in the person. As we read in the parable of the Sower, the "seed" and the "Sower" are always good there is no problem with them. The Sower is very generous with the seed, He is sowing it on all types of soil – on the paths, the rocky ground, among thorns, and on good soil.

The problem lies in the soil, in the person itself.
The person does not even listen to the word of God being proclaimed at Church – is like the seed sown on the path that the evil one snatched away. When we are distracted or not paying attention at church or while reading God’s word – the evil one is snatching away all the good seed that is being sown.

We may be the type of person who listens to the word and accepts it with joy, however, it does not take root in us – we easily forget it and move on to the next thing.

Or we may be the third type of soil that grows the seed into a plant but gets choked as it’s growing among thorns, thorns are the care and anxieties and troubles of this world that cause us to lose the Word we have received.

So the next time we try to complain about the word of God or the Church we should also examine ourselves – to see if we were good soil or we let the evil one snatch the seed away or did not let the word take root or let the cares of this world distract us from the word of God.
Everyone at Mass receives the same Eucharist, yet some turn out to be saints and others, sinners. It's not about what we receive but what we allow Christ to do in us.

As we have dedicated a year to reading God’s word in this BIAY program, I hope and pray that we are all being good soil for the good seed we receive.

I pray that we produce abundant fruit – 30, 60 and a 100 fold fruit and produce.

May we be good soil for the Word of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 261 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 11:3
*"Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"*

John was the one through whom God had revealed the identity of the Son of God (John 1:34) to the people.  So why was John doubtful now after so many months?
There are three possibilities:

AAA)
John was going to be executed shortly, but his disciples were still following him instead of following Jesus, probably because they were doubtful about Jesus being the promised divine Messiah king.  Therefore, John sent his disciples to Jesus with the question so that Jesus might clear their doubts, as well as our doubts, that Jesus is the Messiah who was to come.

BBB)
Like many of the Jews, John too may have been expecting a royal warrior Messiah who would free them from oppression under the Roman enemy and their allies. The silent healing miracles and peaceful preaching of Jesus, who was living a poor man's life, didn't fit the description of a royal warrior Messiah whom they were expecting.
This is one reason why the Jews, to this day, are still waiting for the promised Messiah.

CCC)
While in prison John had heard of the miracles Jesus was performing.  It was getting close to the time for John's execution and John must have been expecting and hoping that Jesus would come and use His miraculous power to free him (John) from prison;

John was the one who led the people to Christ, but when John himself was in distress and there was no sign of Jesus, John started doubting if Jesus was the God of Israel who was to come as prophesied (Malachi 3:1), and free them from oppression (Malachi 3:5).

When Jesus received the message He only reminded John’s messengers of the miracles which He (Jesus) had performed.

Sometimes we too can be in the same situation like John (the Baptist).
We may lead people to Christ and assure them that Jesus will be with them during their difficult times.  But when we ourselves are going through distress and we cannot see help coming in the vicinity, then we may tend to get doubtful whether Jesus really has the power to save us from our difficult times and whether we preached correctly about Him.

During such depressing moments Jesus will remind us of all the miracles which He has performed in our lives so that we start counting our blessings, and don’t focus on the storm which has hit our lives.

Matthew 11:12
*From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent people are taking it by force.*

Jesus was not talking about physical violence in the sense of doing harm.  He was talking about the fact that the people of God must be determined. We must be willing to “fight the good fight of faith.”
Christian life is a constant battle with the evil spirits who are represented by humans on earth.

“We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers in heavenly places” (2 Corinthians 10:3-6).

There is no such thing as “quietism” in the Church.
We cannot be passive and make it to Heaven.  We must actively and determinately co-operate with God’s grace.  We must “get violent” in the Spirit of God, and not by any illicit means.

Matthew 11:18-19
*”John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon’;  the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’”*

The Pharisees always found some fault with almost all their prophets, including John and Jesus.  They were not satisfied with anyone.

Like those Pharisees, our pride does not allow us to accept any of God’s anointed ones.  Whichever priest, preacher or spiritual leader God sends to us, we always have some negative comments to make about them.  When they preach, we are busy trying to find some fault in their behaviour or in their preaching, instead of listening to the message which God has sent through them. We don't seem to be satisfied with any of them even though God sends us messengers who are not identical in their character or in their preaching or in their approach. We forget that God's messengers are human like us and therefore not perfect.  We forget that we ourselves are not perfect.

Matthew 11:28-30
*Come to me, all you that labor and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”*
Yoke refers to the religious law (1 Kings 12:4 & 14).
The kings of the old Covenant had introduced harsh laws for the people which made it difficult for the people to follow them.
Jesus gave us a simple law "to love God and love our neighbour as ourselves" along with the gift of the Holy Spirit, through the sacraments. The Holy Spirit helps us to follow the new law.  It is the spiritual gift which the old Covenant people did not have and so they struggled manually to obey the law.
When we love one another our sufferings become light.

Matthew 12:8
*The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.*
In the old Covenant, God was the Lord of the Sabbath and only God could change the Sabbath or authorize someone to work on the Sabbath (Leviticus 23:3). By these words Jesus was revealing His identity as God.
Jesus was never against the Sabbath. He never questioned the sacredness of the Sabbath.  He was working towards restoring the purpose of the Sabbath according to the original Will of God at creation.
The elders had covered the spirit of the Law with numerous traditions. Although their intentions were noble, over the centuries, in the process of honoring the Sabbath the spirit of the Law was forgotten.  Jesus was uncovering them and gradually fulfilling the Law by disregarding the man-made traditions which were against God’s Will.

Matthew 12:14
*The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, to put him to death.*
It is very unusual for the religious authorities to join hands with secular political groups to destroy an enemy.
The Herodians were a group of Jews who were loyal to King Herod, although Herod was not a Jew.  They were normally at war with the Pharisees and Scribes.
But now the Pharisees and Scribes joined together with their enemy (the Herodians) because now they both had a common enemy (Jesus) whom they saw as more powerful than both their groups put together, even though Jesus had no army or weapons.

Matthew 12:29
*How can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property, without first tying up the strong man?  Then indeed the house can be plundered.*
By His sacrifice on the Cross Jesus put Satan on a leash (tied him), and by His resurrection Jesus has given us the sacraments to release all God’s people who were kept there in bondage in Satan’s house since the time of Adam.

Matthew 12:32
*Whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this life or in the life to come.*
This statement of Jesus implies that there are some sins that can be forgiven in the next life and some that cannot, which was according to the general belief of the Jews.
Mortal sins cannot be forgiven after physical death but venial sins can and will be forgiven after physical death when the person has completed his/her purification term in Sheol / Purgatory.

Matthew 12:38-42
The Pharisees & Scribes did not ask for a miracle from Jesus because He hadn’t performed any or because they hadn’t seen any, and not that they would believe Him if He performed one more.  They were probably looking for entertainment.
Jonah loved his people and was willing to die to save them.
Jesus too loved His people and was willing to die to save them.
Jonah was in the belly of the whale (the earth) (Jonah 2:2 & 6) for 3 days.
Jesus too was in the belly of the earth for 3 days.
After he came out of the whale’s belly, Jonah went to the evil and adulterous Ninevah with a message from God and Ninevah repented.
After the Resurrection of Jesus, Peter and Paul went to evil and adulterous Rome with a message from God (the Gospel) and many in Rome repented and converted to Christianity.
After Ninevah repented, God used them as an axe to destroy Israel.
After many in Rome repented and converted, Jesus used pagan Rome as an axe to destroy Jerusalem.
The evil and adulterous Jews had asked Jesus for a sign (Matthew 12:38-39) and Jesus promised to give them the sign of Jonah.  Jesus fulfilled His promise 40 years later (in AD 70) when Rome destroyed Jerusalem.

Matthew 12:43-45
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc.  A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are Baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don’t keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying.  We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Matthew 12:48
And he replied, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”  And looking at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!  Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to bear the Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Matthew 13:24–30
The weed/darnel grows with the wheat and both look identical. We can only tell the difference when the wheat starts bearing fruit.

The devil is very tricky and evil.  He takes half the truth and twists it. He then tries to prove how it matches with God's Word (Genesis 3:4-5; Luke 4:9-11).  If he succeeds in tricking us, it may sometimes be too late before we realize our errors, after we see the consequences, as in the case of Adam and Eve.  But, like Jesus, if we know our scriptures well, then we will know the difference between good and evil, and between truth and lies, and save ourselves in time.

The line of separation between good and evil, also runs within each one of us.
Do we want to believe the full truth (the wheat) or are we happy to settle for half truth (the weeds/darnel)?

Matthew 13:31-32
The first century Jews, who knew their scriptures well, would have expected Jesus to compare the Kingdom of God (the new Israel) to a cedar of Lebanon, but instead Jesus compared it to a mustard shrub which grows upto 6 to 10 feet in height.
That is because:
A) the Kingdom of God *is glorious* but does not *look glorious* like the kingdoms of this world.
B) the Kingdom of God began with 12 inexperienced members and God empowered them to expand the Kingdom.
C) the size of God’s Kingdom (the Church) depends on the *number of saints* and not on the *number of people*.
D) the Kingdom of God spreads like the roots of the mustard shrub which spread rapidly and eventually occupy the entire garden where they are planted.

Matthew 13:33
Jesus used examples from creation to teach the people because Israel was an agricultural society and also because God speaks to us and teaches us through His creation.

Preparing bread is one such example.
To prepare bread we must :

1. *crush the grains.*
   This should remind us of the scourging & death of Jesus to form the Church.
2. *then we combine the flour with water.*
   This should remind us of the baptized people meeting together for worship in Church as one family of God.
3. *then we add yeast for the dough to rise.* (Luke 13:21)
   This should remind us to spread the Word of God so that we can bring people to Christ and help the Kingdom of God to grow.
4. *then we bake the bread.*
   This should remind us that together we are one Body in Christ when we celebrate the new Passover (the Mass).
5. *then we consume the bread.*
   This should remind us that when we receive the Bread of Life / Eucharist (Communion) we are all united with Christ in a spiritual marriage.

Matthew 13:52
*And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”*
The kingdom of Heaven cannot be understood unless we understand how the new Testament is hidden in the old and the old Testament is revealed in the new.
In other words, to understand the new Testament we must first understand its Jewish roots.

On one side are the gentiles and on the other side are the Jews and Jesus is the hinge between the two.

### Day #262 Authority – Keys to the Kingdom

Jesus and his disciples go on a 29-mile hike – to a place where most Jews would not want to even go. Caesarea Philippi was in a hills country which was the epic center of all pagan worship. In the caves of the big Rocky Mountains were temples to many pagan gods, and there was a lot of pagan sacrifice happening at any given time. Jesus possibly took the disciples to the highest peak and asked them this question “Who do you say that I am?”

“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” 14 And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15 He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 16 Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” 17 And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. 18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

When Peter declared Jesus as the Messiah, the son of the living God, Peter was also saying that all of those other pagan religions are nothing but fake earthly idol worship. Jesus in return standing on a big high rock proclaims Peter as the rock on which Jesus would build His church. Unlike the rock in Caesarea Philippi that housed all pagan temples – Jesus is building His church in living people – our bodies will be the temple of the Holy Spirit.

The gates of Hades will not prevail against us – is not a defensive statement but an offensive statement. So we the church should not be fearful of the evil one and his kingdom – but the evil one has to be afraid of us – here the reference is on the gates of Hades – that means we will be able to go to the gates of Hell and defeat the evil one in his own home ground. Even the gates of Hell will not be able to stop us, who bear the light of Christ.

Peter is given authority – the keys to the Kingdom.
In order to understand the Keys to the Kingdom, we need to put on the lens of the Israeli Kingdom, not this 21st-century lens. The King was the supreme authority, but when he was going away, he would give all governing authority to the “al-habbayit” he would give him this big Key that he would literally carry on his shoulder. He would have the same authority as the king, along with authority he was also given the responsibility to be a father to the people. As we read the below verses we can read about the authority and the role of the al-habbayit/stewart/father over the household.

“In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. Is 22:20-25

This prophecy is fulfilled when Jesus instituted Peter as the first Pope(Papa/Father) the “al-habbayit”.
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Mat 16:18-20
The concept of the papacy is not something new that was introduced by the catholic church it’s seen back in Isiah. The al-habbayit who had the key which opened the gates of the kingdom and the treasury, he had the authority to bind and loose. The first pope Peter did this very role, we can see the evidence in the acts of the apostles and other letters – they would always consult Peter on doctrine. This did not end with Peter, it was handed down to Linus, and Clement (who are mentioned in the NT).
Till this day the present Pope has the authority passed down, to bind and lose. In the OT we have read how the judges and lower and upper courts would sit in judgment. Creating laws and regulations – going back and forth and finally agreeing on what is the law.
In the same way, the Catholic Church is the universal church that has the authority given by Jesus to define and expand the new law of the Spirit. The Old Testament temple authorities had very heavy laws that they would enforce on the faithful. Jesus abolishes all those man-made requirements and laws – like the washing of hands/cups and eating of certain foods only. Jesus gives this role to Peter and the disciples.
Jesus takes us back to the heart of the commandments that God gave us to love God and to love our neighbor. Jesus appointed Peter and every succeeding pope to along with the councils to bind into law all the teachings of the Holy Spirit, the Bible is one of the initial things that the catholic church was instrumental in discerning the books that belong and finally authorizing the official books of the Bible. We will learn more about what the CC teaches when we do the catechism in a year. The catechism of the catholic church is the work of the church –inspired by the Holy Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 262 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 14:15-20
This was a demonstration of how God wants to use our bodies to help the poor and needy till all are satisfied physically, which is in imitation of how Jesus generously feeds us, spiritually, with His Body (Communion).

Therefore, after seeking God’s blessings we must generously share whatever we can, with the less fortunate ones, and God will multiply our gifts so that we can share more till all are satisfied, just as Jesus generously multiplies and shares His sacramental Body (Communion) to feed us so that our souls are completely nourished.

*Jesus said to them, “There is no need for them to go away; give them some food yourselves.”*
Jesus told the Apostles to share whatever they had, and they did, and God multiplied their resources so that everyone's hunger was satisfied.
Jesus tells us the same “give them what you have.”
We don’t have to be a Bible scholar to share the Word of God.
We can share whatever we learnt and God will multiply our resources.
We don’t have to be a millionaire to help the less fortunate ones.
We can just share with them whatever we have; whether it is food, clothes, love, prayers, or anything else, but we must share the best what we have and with a clean heart.

Peter gave Jesus only his friendly love (John 21:15-19), and Jesus accepted it, multiplied it and transformed it into sacrificial love, so that Peter ended up giving his life for Jesus.
In every act of generosity Jesus says, "You do your best and I will do the rest."
What we do not have, we cannot give and that is where we trust in God.
Let us therefore offer up to Jesus whatever loaves and fish we can offer, so that Jesus can multiply them and transform them for the growth of His Kingdom.

This miracle was not just about sharing.  This was a miracle of God providing His people with supernatural food.
By the miraculous multiplication of the bread in the desert, Jesus was echoing the daily miracle of the first Exodus which was the miraculous bread from Heaven (Manna) given to the people by God to nourish their bodies during their physical journey through the desert.

Jesus was also foreshadowing the daily miracle of the new Exodus when God would feed His people with the Heavenly bread (the Eucharist / Communion) to nourish their bodies during their spiritual journey through the desert of earthly exile.
This miracle was a foreshadow of the Last Supper when Jesus used the same pattern (Matthew  26:26-30 / Mark 14:22-26 / Luke 22:14-20 / 1 Corinth.11:23-25).
He took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to his disciples to be distributed.

Matthew 14:22-33
Peter was a fisherman, he knew how to swim (John 21:7) and he knew the destructive force of the storm.  When he looked at Jesus he was able to walk on the water.  But when he looked at the storm he was afraid and started to sink because he took his eyes away from Jesus and focused on the world which only put fear in his heart.  His knowledge of the storm weakened his faith in Christ.

Like Peter, sometimes too much knowledge of worldly matters and impatience, weakens our faith in Christ by creating doubts.  When we are focused on Jesus, we can walk through any storm undisturbed.

When Peter called out to Jesus to save him, Jesus immediately reached out and took Peter by the hand but calmed the strong wind later.
When we are caught up in the storms of life, if we call out to Jesus “Lord save me” he will reach out his hand and help us through the storm if we obey Him.

Matthew 15:1-6
*And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?”*
Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined God’s truths. He instructed his followers to abide by the traditions that are not contrary to God’s commandments.  And, as the Apostles taught (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15), the rest are to be obeyed.

Matthew 15:11
*Jesus summoned the crowd again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.  It is not what goes into a person’s mouth that makes him ritually unclean.  It is the things that come out from his mouth that makes him ritually unclean.”*
Eating something that is dirty can make our bodies sick but not our souls.  Our souls become sick and weak when negative words come out of our mouths, and this puts both our souls and bodies in the custody of the devil whose aim is to destroy both.

It is therefore always best to speak when our mind is cool, even when we face people whose minds are out of control.  When our mind is heated, the words which come out of our mouths can be physically and emotionally destructive to those around us, and spiritually destructive to our own souls.

The mouth is only one God-given outlet in our body where we can control what comes out of it because whatever words come out of our mouths will always come out by our choice.
So let us avoid negative words coming out of our mouths (example: gossiping, insulting, ridiculing, speaking ill about others, lying, harsh words, offensive language, etc.).  If we are guilty of this sin then let us ensure to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and, thereafter, spread the light of Christ whenever we speak.

Matthew 15:22-23
*Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.”  But he did not answer her at all.*
Sometimes when we pray to God to help our wayward children to come back to Him, we may notice that God remains silent for a long time.
The silence of God is not His indifference. When God is silent He is secretly planning mercy for the children while He is also planning the spiritual healing of the parents.
Therefore, while the parents pray for their children, they must also focus on examining themselves.

*And his disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.”*
When we cry to the Lord to have mercy on our children who have gone away from Him, and the people around us try to silence us or discourage us, let us remember that it was the persistent prayer of the Canaanite woman that delivered her daughter from the evil spirit, inspite of facing objection from people.

*He said in reply (to His disciples), “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”*
Jesus neither gave His disciples the permission to send her away nor did He tell His disciples to remain silent like Him.
By telling His disciples that His mission was to preach first to the Jews, Jesus was actually telling her to wait for her turn till later.

*Jesus answered, “It is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”*
It may sound like Jesus was being rude to the woman, but that is exactly how it feels when our faith is being tested.
When Jesus compared the woman to a dog, she had two options :

1. she could allow her pride to control her, take the response of Jesus as an insult and leave Jesus, OR,
2. she could humble herself and accept that she was not the greatest.
   If she chose Option 1, then, because of her pride, her daughter would have to live with the demon all her life.
   But the Cannanite woman made a wise choice.  She chose Option 2, and Jesus healed the child because of the faith, humility and persistent prayer of the mother.
   Let us learn from the Cannanite woman to humble ourselves and choose our words wisely when we communicate with others.

Matthew 16:15
*Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”*
Do we really believe that Jesus is the Messiah and that he can give us eternal life?
Do our words and actions show that we are true followers of Jesus?
Would we follow God’s commandments when we are going through suffering?
To believe that Jesus is the Messiah is to follow His way of self-denial and live for others even if we have to go through suffering.

Matthew 16:16-17
*Jesus said to Simon in reply, “Blessed are you, Simon, bar-Jonah (or son of Jonah). For flesh and blood (your human brain) has not revealed this to you, but it was given to you by my Father in heaven.”*
All knowledge and intelligence comes from God because He is the one who created our complex brain and without God we are nothing. Therefore, whenever we make wise decisions in life, it is not because of the power of our brain, but because God opens our mind and makes it possible for us to make those decisions.  Therefore we need to be thankful to God and give Him the glory for all our achievements, instead of boasting about our achievements and enjoying the glory ourselves.

Matthew 16:18
*Jesus said to Simon, “And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.”*
By these words Jesus confirmed the guarantee of His perpetual divine assistance to protect the Church (the Eucharist) from Satan.
By these words Jesus also assured all Christians that as long as we live we will not be deprived of the heavenly Bread (His mystical Body / the Eucharist).
Jesus, in His humanity, is, and will be, with us in the Eucharist / the consecrated Bread every day, until the end of time (Matthew 28:20),

Jesus confirmed Simon’s office as Pope in the Kingdom of God on earth (the Church):

1. by changing his name;
2. by declaring that Simon Peter would be the leader of the foundation stones on which the Church would be built (Revelation 21:14);
3. by giving Simon the spiritual keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, an authority which rested only the Prime Minister in the Davidic Kingdom;
4. by giving Simon the power to bind and loose (the authority to interpret God’s Law, to absolve or retain sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church) (John 20:20-23; Deut. 17:8-13).

Name change was meant to reflect the divine mission of the name owner.
Jesus was going to make Simon Peter the rock-solid foundation of the Church.
God does not call the qualified. This means God does not call us for His divine mission on the basis of our expertise but He may use our talents to accomplish His divine mission through us.

Peter himself was the longest reigning Pope, occupying his office from the year of the first Pentecost in 30 AD until around 67 AD.  After Simon Peter’s death, his episcopal office was taken over by his successor, Pope Linus (AD 67), the same Linus who served the Church during the time of Paul (2 Timothy 4:21).  Pope Francis is the 266th Pope since Simon Peter.

Matthew 17:22-27
Jesus didn't have to pay the Temple tax but He still gave to the Temple.
Maybe it is time for us to examine the level of our generosity towards the Church.

### The Father's Generosity

[![The Father's Generosity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day263.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wVycggMYuBk "The Father's Generosity")

### Day #263 Forgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts us

As we read through all the parables the theme of forgiveness seems to run through all of them.
The Good shepherd goes after the lost sheep with so much love and forgiveness instead of anger and frustration. If you find yourself in sin today and are feeling down and miserable – don’t worry Jesus the Good Shepherd is coming to seek after you – He loves you and will forgive you – in fact, He will rejoice over you.

What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? 13 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. 14 So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost. Mat 18:12-14

Now “Forgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts us” that is why Peter asks how many times should we forgive.

21 Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?” 22 Jesus said to him, “Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times. Mat 18:21-22

Jesus gives peter an answer that he didn’t like – did Jesus mean that we should forgive 7\*70 times which is 490 times. No, we need to forgive them the 491st time as well, Jesus was using Hyperbole. Just like we say, “Will be back in a second” – we mean in a few mins don’t we.
Jesus helps us understand this better with this parable, which shows that we should be forgiving because we have been forgiven.

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant
23 “For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. 24 When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; 25 and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. 26 So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’ 27 And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. 28 But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‘Pay what you owe.’ 29 Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you.’ 30 But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. 31 When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. 32 Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‘You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. 33 Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?’ 34 And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. 35 So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.” Mat 18:23-35

Here the number thousand talents that the servant owed to the King – is actually such a large number when you do the math on it.
ONE TALENT = 20.4kgs (of Gold or silver)
Ten thousand Talents = 20.4 x 10,000 = 2,04,000 kgs in measurement
1 gram of gold is like $50 so for the 2,04,000 kgs – it is like $10,2000,000

So the servant owed the king 100 Million dollars.

The point here is the King knew that the servant will never be able to pay off the debt, so the king forgives the servant and expects the servant to do the same. When the servant did not forgive those who were indebted to him, that is when the King threw the servant into prison. The lesson to learn is we should forgive others as we have been shown great mercy from God. Let us learn to forgive our brothers and sisters from the heart.
Forgiveness is the "Key" that unlocks God’s super-abundant mercy.
Even if we don’t like to forgive because it hurts so much, we should pray for the strength to forgive those who hurt us and love them even though it hurts.
For our salvation depends on our forgiveness. We pray this prayer everyday when we say the Our father.

"Forgive us our trespasses “AS” we forgive those who trespass against us" Mat 6:12

In refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our hearts are closed and their hardness makes them impervious to the Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are opened to his grace. CCC 2840

So let us strive very hard to make things right with everyone, prayer and forgive them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### DAY #264 THE NECESSITY FOR WATCHFULNESS

I think one of the most important things in life is to be prepared for Jesus’s second coming. In our lifetime we will surely meet the Lord either in the second coming or when we die. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful – for no one knows the time when the Lord comes.

36 “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, 39 and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. 41 Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. 42 Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.

The day of the Lord will come when people least expect it, there will be two types of people on the day of the Lord. The first kind of people are those who are prepared for Him, and the second type is those who are not prepared. Two women were grinding food, one was taken and one was left back, two were in the field one was taken and one was left back.

Which person would you want to be? I guess you will say that “I want to be the one that was taken, the one that was prepared”. It’s simple just follow the two keywords – watchful and prayerful.

Just like in the parable of the wedding banquet, the banquet was ready and the people were not prepared for it. Those who were invited did not show up, which lead the servants to go and bring in all the people who were hungry. The people who came to the wedding banquet were not dressed accordingly. They were not prepared for the wedding banquet. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful.

11 “But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, 12 and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.”

The Church provides us with two seasons every year – Advent and Lent. Advent and Lent are perfect seasons to prepare "the way of the Lord". Just as every sports team plays different seasons – probably yearly. We get to work on our readiness every year, through fasting prayer, and almsgiving we strengthen our resolve to become holy and renew our spiritual lives. May the Lord find us ready when He comes in glory, the best way to be ready is to stay in friendship with Jesus, always stay in the state of grace and be in communion with the church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 264 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 22:1-14 (1)
In this parable, God the Father is the King (Matthew 5:35) and Jesus is the bridegroom (Matthew 9:15).
Three times God the Father sent out invitations to humanity for the marriage (Passover / Mass) of His Son (Jesus).

The 1st invitation symbolizes the initial call to human beings, when God created Adam and Eve.  He made a Covenant with them, but they broke it, and their descendants followed in their footsteps, thus declining the invitation to God’s banquet.

The 2nd invitation was for Israel, God’s chosen people led by Moses. He invited them to enter into a Covenant, at Mount Sinai, but this was also broken.  Some ignored the invitation because they were too busy satisfying their own desires and others tortured or killed many of the prophets and priests and therefore God allowed their country to be destroyed by foreign countries.

So a 3rd invitation was sent out, through the Apostles/bishops, to the whole of humanity, good and bad alike (Matthew 13:47–48), and some people started accepting Christianity, but not everyone who accepted Christianity was accepted by the King.
One man was cast out because he wasn’t wearing a wedding robe, and this seems harsh.  In the ancient world, it was customary for the person hosting the banquet to provide wedding robes for the guests. These robes were freely given by the host, just like salvation is freely given to anyone who wants to accept it.

By wearing their wedding robes the guests were honoring the host, which means that the man who was not wearing a wedding robe was showing extreme disrespect for the King and his son.  The King couldn’t believe that someone would turn down a wedding robe that was so freely given.  When the man was questioned he had no answer.

The robe (the grace of God) was given to the man and all he had to do was put it on, but the man chose to reject the grace of God.  He wanted to enjoy the banquet but on his own terms, not on the King’s terms.

This is like following only selective parts of the Bible or creating our own brand of Christianity, or making decisions based only on what we think is right and not considering if our decisions are right in God’s eyes.
There are many who want to enjoy the heavenly banquet, but on their own terms.  They want to follow their own gospels or ideologies.  If we want to be part of the heavenly banquet, we have to follow all the rules laid out by the King.

If we are not covered with a white robe (in a state of grace), then we cannot attend the banquet (the marriage supper of the Lamb / Communion).

Matthew 22:1-14 (2)
Our wedding garment must be made up of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness, love, (Colossians 3:12-14).  In other words, we can receive the robe of righteousness when peace, gratitude and the Word of God are within us (Colossians 3:15-16) and we engage ourselves with works of mercy, that is, loving concern for the people around us, specially to the least of our brothers and sisters.
We cannot participate in God's banquet of love if we remain indifferent to the suffering and needs of the less fortunate ones around us. We cannot say we love the God who we cannot see if we do not love our neighbours who we can see (1 John 4:20).

Therefore, before we gather together for the heavenly banquet every Sunday, let us ensure that we have kept our eyes and ears open to see and hear the voice of God through the cries of the needy ones so that we can be of help to them in whatever way we can.
Let us pray that we may be worthy of a place in God's kingdom by living our lives on earth according to His Will.

Matthew 22:15-21
*"Is it lawful to pay taxes to Emperor Caesar, or not?  Should we pay them, or should we not?”*
Herodians were a group of people who had made a deal with the Romans to allow the Herodian dynasty to rule Israel as vassal kings in the name of the Roman Emperors, allowing the Romans to occupy Israel, ensuring that Israel would pay their taxes to Rome, etc.  Because of this deal the Herodians were not very popular with the Pharisees.
If Jesus said "yes" then the people would be angry and go against Him for supporting the Romans;
If Jesus said "no" then the Herodians would be angry and would definitely take the message to the Romans.
The answer of Jesus is not a confirmation that state and religion are to be considered separate.  Everything that belonged to Caesar ultimately belonged to God.

*“Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.”*
God gives us leaders for our countries to be good stewards of His creation.  They are God's instruments given to us for maintaining public order and for the common good.  We are therefore bound to pay our taxes regularly and pray for our governments that they may always do God’s Will (1 Timothy 2:1–2), while we give ourselves to God, body, mind and soul, for His work and to worship Him, because we belong to Him.

We must respect our governing authorities and obey the state Laws, if they are in line with God’s Will, because they are legitimate authorities.
Let us ask our Lord to forgive us for the times we have given ourselves to our Caesars (ungodly authorities) instead of giving ourselves to God.

Matthew 22:23
*Some Sadducees, who don’t believe in the resurrection, came to him and asked him a question.*
Sadducees don't believe in the resurrection, so they asked a tricky question. If Jesus failed to prove the resurrection then He would be proving Himself to be a false Messiah.

Resurrected life is not a transfer of earthly life into Heaven.  It is a life of supreme communion with God.

The Pharisees believed in the resurrection.
The Sadducees did not believe in anything that was not mentioned in the Torah.  They also didn't accept any word that was not mentioned in the Torah.  Therefore they didn't believe in the resurrection because the word *"resurrection"* was not mentioned in the Torah.

The Sadducees were mocking the faith for which seven brothers and their mother had died, during the reign of king Antiochus (2 Maccabees 7:1-41).

Matthew 22:28-30
Marriage between man and woman was designed by God for procreation of life on earth to keep the human race alive, because every human has to be tested for their faith (in God), except those who die in the womb or before the age of accountability and those who are mentally unstable.
Man and woman must fill the earth with holy children who would then be taken to Heaven by God at the appointed time.

Procreation serves the purpose of transmitting life to the next generation.
In Heaven there is no testing so whoever passes the test on earth goes to Heaven and that is the termination of procreation, therefore there is no need for marriage in Heaven.
But this is not out of any natural necessity; it is the way God designed it.
Those in Heaven can neither die physically nor spiritually.

Marriage between man and woman is only a sign of the relation between Jesus and His bride (the Church) (Ephesians 5:23).  Just as man and woman unite to bring forth new human life, similarly our marriage with Jesus, when we receive the Body of Christ / Communion, must cause us to go forth and evangelize the world to bring souls into the Church.

“People in Heaven are like angels” does not mean that they will be spirits forever.  Humans are special beings composed of body and soul whereas angels are pure spirits.  When humans go to Heaven they will initially be only spirits but after the Last Judgement all humans in Heaven will receive their glorified human bodies, except Jesus and His Mother who were the only two humans who went to Heaven with their sinless human bodies.
What Jesus meant was that when humans go to Heaven they will live forever like the angels.

Matthew 22:35-39
The Gospel is a message of God’s pure, unconditional, sacrificial love for us.  He wants us to return that love by loving all the people who we meet during our lifetime. But we struggle to love others because love was damaged in the Garden of Eden when humans made a Covenant with the devil and allowed him to control their conscience.
Let us, therefore, ensure that we receive the sacraments (Confession and Communion) regularly, so that we can receive the spiritual strength and ability to love others as we love ourselves and as God loves us.

Matthew 23:1-7
Jesus was not abolishing religion because it is God’s Will that we must be religious as well as spiritual, which is why He spent four decades in the wilderness giving Moses minute details to train the people of the old Covenant for the religious rituals of the new Covenant.
We cannot do away with religion just as we cannot do away with politics because humans are made of body and soul composite.
Therefore, just as God gives us political leaders to govern our bodies, so also God gives us religious leaders to govern our souls.

When majority of the Christians live in disobedience to God, that is, they receive Communion with mortal sins, or don't attend Mass, or don’t help the poor, etc., the world does not get sanctified and therefore God is not glorified.

Jesus commanded us to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20) and shine our light wherever we go (Matthew 5:14-16).  When we ignore or neglect this command we make Satan’s army stronger.  Instead of spreading the Gospel, we gradually start blending with the pagan world, our sins increase and our culture becomes corrupt.

In short, if we are not willing to transform the world to be godly, then the world will gradually transform us (into pagans).

And when we get religious and political leaders from this corrupt culture we cannot expect good leaders.
Such leaders may constantly make ungodly decisions because it is usually to win the people’s favour.  When our desires are disordered we go along with their decisions and thus we walk on the road to hell along with our leaders because we ourselves are not aware of what is right and what is wrong.

Those who live in friendship with Christ will know when their leaders (religious and political) make decisions that are not in line with God’s Will.

Therefore, it is important that we shine our light wherever we go by living faithful Christian lives, receiving the sacraments (Confession & Communion) regularly, helping the poor and needy, praying daily and obeying all what Jesus has commanded us to do.

Matthew 23:19
The Altar of the old Covenant was a fore shadow of the Altar of the new Covenant. The Altar of the new Covenant represents the Body of Christ after it is consecrated.  God had commanded the people that the Altar must always be consecrated before using it for worship (Exodus 29:37) because it is the Body of Christ that makes our gifts holy, through the power of the Holy Spirit, when we place them on the Altar, the most important ones being bread and wine.
But unfortunately the people started treating unconsecrated material goods as more holy than the consecrated Altar (Matthew 23:19).

Matthew 24:29-31
Jesus was speaking of two destructions:  the Temple and the city.
The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe.
The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.

Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city.  It was a Temple with a city around it, but it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).

Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city.  It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it.  The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally (because the Church has parishes all over the world).

### Sins of Omission

[![Sins of Omission](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day265.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hcqPPHKcDSU "Sins of Omission")

### DAY #265 FAITH & WORKS

We are not saved just by believing but our faith should have associated works. Faith without works is dead, of course, we are not saved because of our work only. We cannot separate faith and works – because they are married together and one without the other is incomplete.

14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,” and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? 17 So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead. James 2:14-17
We see that in the final judgment of the nations people are either saved or lost eternally because of their works.
The Judgment of the Nations
31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, 33 and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. 34 Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; 35 for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? 38 And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? 39 And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?’ 40 And the king will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.’ 41 Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‘You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; 42 for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ 44 Then they also will answer, ‘Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not take care of you?’ 45 Then he will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” Mat 25: 31-46

The sin of omission is the sin of failing to love your neighbor and failing to come to the aid of those who are in need. The works that we are called to do are feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting those in prison in general caring for the needy. Our faith should move us to action, we cannot just say “God bless” to a person in need and expect everything to be fine. We cannot say we have faith and do no works, faith, and works are tightly interlinked.
We cannot sit tight on the gifts and talents that Lord gives us and expect everything to be okay. Like in the parable of the talents, the ones who used the talents were rewarded.
The servant of did nothing with the talents was punished and thrown in hell.

But his master replied, ‘You wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. 29 For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. 30 As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ Mat 25

Let us not be lazy with all the resources that are given to us, let us come to the aid of those in need. Let us do as much charity as we can and bless those who are struggling.
May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 265 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 25:13
*Jesus said, “stay awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Lord will come.”*
Forewarned is forearmed.
In our day-to-day life many such situations arise when we have to be prepared in advance for a crisis, but we ignore them or put them off for another day, thinking we know better.
God has given us freedom of choice to obey Him always and live in a state of grace at all times so that when Jesus knocks at the door we will be ready to go with Him.
Let us, therefore, stay alert, be aware and be prepared at all times.

Matthew 25:34-36
The sheep go to Heaven, not just because they did the works of mercy and checked off the item on their checklist but, because they did those works out of love and compassion for their neighbour.  The Gospel is a message of love and compassion, the kind of heart that God has.  And because God's kingdom is a holy kingdom it is important that all the subjects/children keep themselves sanctified by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly.

Matthew 26:1-5
*It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.*
God had given these two festivals to the Israelites as two separate feasts but during the time of Jesus they were both being celebrated together as desired by God.
Both feasts of the old Covenant were shadows of the Unleavened Bread (Communion) and Passover (Mass) of the new Covenant which Jesus inaugurated in the Upper Room and finished on Calvary and thereafter gave them to the Church to be celebrated until the end of time.

*The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, “Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.”*
The normal population of Jerusalem was around 40,000 but during the Passover it would be around 200,000, because God had mandated that every male Jew must go to Jerusalem to celebrate the old Passover, so that, without their knowledge, every male Jew would be a witness to the sacrifice of the Lamb (of God) on the Cross for the first Passover of the new Covenant, in atonement for their sins.

Everything was going according to God's divine plan and God allowed the evil ones to go ahead with their plan so that God’s plan would be fulfilled.

On the day and hour when the hour earthly lambs would be slaughtered for the old Passover to commemorate the physical liberation of the people of the old Israel from the evil Pharaoh, on the same day and hour the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) would be killed for the new Passover to spiritually liberate the baptized people of the new Israel (the Church) from Satan.

Matthew 26:14-16
*Then one of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, “What will you give me if I hand him over to you?” They paid him thirty pieces of silver, and from that time on he looked for an opportunity to hand Jesus over.*
Judas was chosen so that he could forget his past habits and become a faithful disciple of Christ. But somewhere in between Judas lost his focus on discipleship and focused more on the world.  By choosing to betray Jesus he was committing a mortal sin and therefore had a tragic end.

We are baptized into Jesus to be His disciples by living holy lives and to evangelize the world by sharing the Word of God.  But, like Judas, when we focus more on the pleasures and comforts of this world and lose our focus on our discipleship then, like Judas, we too are betraying Jesus and our soul may meet with a tragic end.

The chief priests bribed Judas to betray Jesus and Judas accepted the bribe to do the unlawful act of selling Jesus.

The chief priests represent those Christians who bribe others to get work done illegally, and Judas represents those Christians who accept or ask for bribes to proceed with work against the law.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with accepting bribes, like Judas, we too are standing on Calvary and selling Jesus to the devil to be scourged and crucified.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with giving bribes to do something unlawful, like the chief priests, we are guilty of scourging and crucifying Jesus.
Whether we give bribes or take bribes or whether we are the middle person in a bribe, in all three cases we commit a mortal sin.  If we are guilty of being involved in a bribe in any way, we must return the bribe or give it away and confess our sins without delay.

Matthew 26:17-25
*On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”*
Before the institution of the Last Supper / Eucharist, the disciples prepared a Passover lamb for the feast.  That earthly lamb was a symbol of the physical sacrifice of Jesus and was supposed to be the “LAST” animal sacrifice offered to God.

“Preparation of the Passover” meant that the lambs would be slaughtered and then roasted by spitting them with skewers, that is, passing one skewer vertically through the back of the lamb from head to bottom and the other skewer through the shoulders from left to right.  This was a shadow of the Lamb of God on the Cross.

Thus, by spitting the lambs during the Passover of the Old Covenant, the people were asked to slaughter and crucify the lambs and eat the flesh, as a shadow of the real sacrifice of the Lamb of God and the Passover meal (Communion) of the New Covenant.

Matthew 26:26
*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

The priest consumes the bread and wine separately because that is how Jesus gave it to them in the Upper Room.  The offering of the sacrifice is complete only when the priest consumes both.

*This is my body ...........*
*This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said “Amen.”
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

The words of consecration can be repeated by anyone, but the transubstantiation takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit only when an apostolic priest says the exact words in obedience to the command of Jesus because the authority was given only to the ordained apostles, who in turn must give that same authority to their apostolic successors.  Therefore, if any other person repeats the words of consecration the bread and wine will still remain bread and wine; they will not be transformed.

Offering bread and wine separately is a symbol of death, because death begins when blood is separated from the body.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice.  Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real.  Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired.  By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

When God became man, He took on our human matter (the dust of the earth).
When Jesus was on the earth and He healed the people of their sicknesses, cast out demons, gave them sight, cured the deaf and mute, etc., the people received the sacraments (graces) from the living visible God.
After the descent of the Holy Spirit Jesus pours His graces into us through the sacraments using ordinary earthly materials (water, bread, wine, oil, etc.) as an outward sign of an inward grace.
Therefore, when we receive the sacraments we receive the invisible but living Jesus.  The sacraments continue the incarnational principle when God touched the earth (Mary's womb) so that we can encounter the living invisible Jesus during our lifetime.

The first Adam gave us the forbidden fruit and thus brought death to the world.
The new Adam (Jesus) gives us the blessed fruit (the consecrated bread) when we are in a state of grace and thus brings life to the world.

Wine is a symbol of God’s love or wrath.
In the Garden of Eden. Adam & Eve were drunk on God's wine of love.  After the Original sin man and woman ran out of the wine of God’s love within them because they destroyed the divine life within them.
By giving us His Blood in the form of consecrated wine, during Mass, Jesus restores creation to its original form through.
He restores the relationship between God and man, between man & wife, between body & soul, and between humans & the rest of creation.

Matthew 26:47-49, 56, 69-74
*All 12 apostles received their priestly ordination (Holy Orders) in the Upper Room and all 12 of them had the Eucharist (Communion) but shortly after that Judas betrayed Jesus, Peter denied Jesus and the remaining 10 abandoned Jesus.*
Receiving Communion or any other sacraments is not a guarantee that the devil will stop tempting us to follow him.  One mortal sin is enough for the devil to start controlling our thoughts, words and deeds, and make us use our bodies (eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc.) for sinful purposes.  He has a million ways to fool us into committing sins.  We must, therefore, remain alert to sin until the last day of our lives and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation whenever we fail.

*Jesus was taken away from the Apostles after Judas betrayed Him.  Thereafter the apostles were scattered by Satan.*
When we betray Jesus with our sins, God leaves us because sin separates us from God.  This automatically puts us in the hands of Satan whose aim is to destroy families and communities and eventually the Church, by causing division between the members.

### Day #266 I am with you always until the end of the age

We read about Judas, the man in despair. He did not know what to do when he realized that he handed over an innocent man.

3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 He said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” 5 Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.Mat 27

We see that Judas gave into despair, he could not come to terms with the mistake he made. There was nothing and no one to console him – he took his life.
Now none of us should ever feel like taking our life, because of what Jesus did for us. Jesus paid the price for all our sins, he took away all our distress, and Jesus promises to be with us always I mean “ALWAYS”.
Jesus knows how it feels to be alone and to feel rejected and abandoned.

45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 46 And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
Jesus was crying out to Abba father – “My God my God why have you forsaken me?”
Can you imagine the pain that the Holy Trinity went through – the Father and the Holy Spirit are always united with Jesus. Even though Jesus was united to the Father, Jesus was allowed to experience the feeling of abandonment. The feeling that we feel when people betray us and abandon us. Jesus was allowed to feel the separation of God that we feel when we commit sin.

We have a loving God who knows how it feels when people abandon us. That is why Jesus reminds us that He is with us all the days of our lives.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.Mat 28
Knowing that Jesus is with us we can feel confident about our mission, the mission to tell everyone that we have Jesus. We have the love of God.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Mat 28

May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 266 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 27:3-5
*Why did Judas kill himself when his plan was successful?*

If Judas really wanted Jesus killed then he would have celebrated when Jesus was arrested because his plan was successful.  But it seems like Judas's intentions were different.

Judas may have been one of those Jews who were expecting a royal warrior Messiah.
Judas fully believed in the power of Jesus because he had seen Jesus performing many miracles, but he found Jesus to be too timid to overthrow the Roman empire and liberate Israel with His miraculous power.  In his pride Judas would have believed that with his brains and Jesus's power, he and Jesus together could overthrow the Romans and rule Israel, and Jesus would always be indebted to Judas for his brainwork to get Jesus the throne.

The temptation offered by Satan to Judas to betray Jesus, arose out of Judas’s knowledge of the power of Jesus.  Satan put the thought into Judas’s head that by having Jesus handed over to the authorities through betrayal (Satan’s method), Judas would force Jesus to use His power to release Himself from the enemy.  Thereafter, he (Judas) could instigate the crowds to crown Jesus as their earthly king.  And this is exactly what Satan wanted.

When Judas betrayed Jesus, he was actually planning his own glory as the right hand man of Jesus, so when he saw that Jesus was going to be killed, Judas understood that his glorious plans had been shattered and he had miserably failed. It didn’t work out as he had planned it.

After what he had done he would have been afraid to face the rest of the Apostles and the disciples of Jesus in the same town and therefore killed himself out of fear and despair.

Instead of killing himself, if Judas would have humbled himself and repented for what he had done, Jesus would have forgiven him, but Judas’s pride did not allow him to do so.

Like Judas, when our hearts are filled with pride it is difficult for us to say "sorry" with remorse ("metanoia" in Greek) and we end up committing more sins to cover up our wrong doings by living in fear or shame.
Repenting and confessing our sins regularly makes us humble enough to live without fear or shame.

Matthew 27:11
*Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”*
The Chief Priests and elders of the Sanhedrin had accused Jesus of blasphemy.  But Pilate was informed that Jesus was claiming to be the political king of the Jews. There was no mention of blasphemy in Pilate's court.
Why?

The Sanhedrin unanimously condemned Jesus as deserving death on grounds of "blasphemy" (a false accusation), because Jesus called Himself the Son of the most High (Mark 14:63-64).
But there was a problem.

The Sanhedrin wanted Jesus dead but they did not have the power and authority to issue a death sentence.  That authority rested only with the Romans, and under the pagan Roman law “blasphemy” was not an offence that deserved the death penalty because they themselves didn’t believe in God.  So the Sanhedrin sent Jesus to Pilate charging Jesus with the crime of treason against the Romans (another false accusation) which, according to the Roman law deserved the death penalty.

That is why Pilate had the inscription fixed on the Cross which read “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews” (John 19:19) so that, in future, if anyone would dare to rise against and overthrow the Roman power then they would meet the same fate as Jesus did.

According to the Roman law, the inscription fixed on the Cross was to indicate the crime of the person crucified.  The inscription was written in Hebrew/Aramaic, Latin and Greek and the place of the crucifixion was near the city (John 19:20).  Thus, without his knowledge, Pilate, the gentile governor, declared to the world that Jesus was King of the Jews, even though it was in mockery.

Matthew 27:11
*Falsely accused.*
If we are going through a difficult time because we have been falsely accused of a crime, let us ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was also falsely accused of two crimes (blasphemy and treason).  Jesus was scourged and crucified even though He was innocent but He forgave His offenders and shed His blood to redeem them.  He is with us through all our sufferings.
Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering.

Matthew 27:21
*All together they shouted, “No, not this man.  WE WANT BARABBAS!”*
Who was Barabbas?
Bar-Abba means “son of the Father” or “son of God”, the name which the Jews had given him.  He was also a criminal who had committed many crimes.  Bar-Abba or Barabbas represents all of us sinners who are sons and daughters of God.

Barabbas did not even turn round and thank Jesus for saving him by going to the Cross instead of him.
Like Barabbas, when we commit sins we too are being ungrateful to Jesus for going to the Cross instead of us.

The people rejected Jesus (their true Messiah) and voted for Barabbas (the false Messiah) so Pilate gave them what they wanted (Matthew 27:17).
When we choose to live in disobedience to God, God will allow us to choose the kind of leaders we deserve, religious and political, because our leaders will be chosen from among us and our sins block us from making the right choices due to separation from God.  Therefore, if we are not happy with our leaders then we need to examine ourselves, instead of judging them.

Matthew 27:22-23
*Why was Jesus killed?*
We know that Jesus died for our sins but He was not killed for our sins.  The religious leaders (High Priest, Pharisees and Scribes) did not know that Jesus came to die to save us from going to Hell and even if they knew they were too proud and arrogant to accept.

*So why was Jesus killed?*
Jesus was killed because:

1. He cured a deaf and mute man which was only possible for God but, according to them, Jesus performed the miracle with the power of Satan, because they didn't accept Him as the divine Messiah.
2. He touched an untouchable person (a leper) to heal him instead of telling the man to go away and quarantine himself.
3. He healed the sick people on the Sabbath.
4. He forgave the adultress woman instead of condemning her.
5. He dined with the despised people (tax collectors and sinners) instead of avoiding them.

In view of the above acts, according to the religious leaders Jesus had become ritually unclean and therefore had to be purged out of their land and community.

If we encounter a person in need, who was despised and shunned by society, would we reach out and help them like Jesus did or would we keep safe distance like those religious leaders?
Following Jesus is not easy.  We either please God or we please the world.

Matthew 27:24
*When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all, but that a riot was breaking out instead, he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. This is your doing.”*
Pilate had the power to release Jesus but Pilate chose not to.

Have we anytime ignored any innocent people being condemned?
When we heard the news did we try to give them physical or moral support?
If it wasn’t possible then did we try to give them spiritual support by praying for them till they received justice?

If we are guilty of having washed our hands when an innocent person was condemned, and we did nothing to help that person get justice, then we are no different from Pilate.

What you did not do for the least of my brothers, you did not do for me (Matthew 25:45).

We cannot attribute the injustice only to Pilate.  Every time we ignore injustice we are guilty of the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus.
Pilate did it physically, we do it spiritually.

Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent but the Jews were screaming that Jesus must be crucified.  If a riot broke out then Pilate would have to give up his chair as governor and thus his luxurious life because the emperor would not tolerate chaos in the jurisdiction of the governor.  Pilate was in the middle of a difficult decision. Therefore, in order to save his position, Pilate ordered Jesus to be scourged and crucified.

But it wasn't just Pilate who made this choice.
Pilate represents all those who are guilty of crucifying Jesus with their sins because they prefer to give up Jesus and cling to their earthly glory and comfortable lives.

Matthew 27:26
*So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, he handed Jesus over to be crucified.*
Pilate’s wife sent him a message to spare Jesus, but Pilate chose to hand Jesus over to be scourged and crucified, because he wanted to please the crowd.

Pontius Pilate represents all of us sinners.
So often we do the wrong things to please the world instead of doing the right things to please God and in doing so, along with Pilate, we too are guilty of the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus.

Matthew 27:26
*Denied justice.*
Have we been denied justice at any time, thus causing us and our families a lot of pain and suffering (emotional and financial)?
Have we or are we going through physical or mental torment?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this injustice willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was innocent and yet He was scourged and crucified, thus putting Him and His mother through a lot of emotional pain and suffering, but He still redeemed His offenders.

*Scourged.*
Are we suffering from pain and discomfort due to skin diseases?
Let us ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was scourged, during which His flesh was ripped off thus causing Him extreme physical pain.  Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering.

Matthew 27:28-31
*Mocked at, insulted & crowned with thorns.*
Have we been criticized or insulted?
Have we been crowned with a nickname in mockery?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus too was insulted and crowned with thorns in mockery, but He still redeemed His offenders.
On the other hand, if we are suffering from any kind of headaches, brain diseases, or any other mental disorders, let us ask the Lord to help us take our cup of suffering and go through it willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was crowned with thorns which were mercilessly sunk into His scalp.  Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering because without suffering we cannot enter Heaven.

Matthew 27:34
*Wine mixed with myrrh.*
If we are addicted to alcohol or drugs to drown our problems, let us ask the Lord to help us get out of this difficult addiction, not forgetting that Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh to drown His pain but He refused.

Matthew 27:35
*Humiliated by being stripped of His clothes in public.*
Have we been humiliated or stripped of our shame in any way, physically or verbally?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus too was humiliated by being stripped of His clothes in front of all the public, but He still redeemed His offenders.
Let us also pray for those who are going through this suffering and have no one to help them, and those who are not able to cover themselves sufficiently during harsh weathers, due to poverty.

Matthew 27:40
*“If you are the Son of God ……....”*
Satan had tried this same trick with Jesus around three years ago, but failed (Matthew 4:3 & 6), the same trick which he had tried with Adam & Eve with success.
Power and wealth being one of the worst human weaknesses, Satan thought that this one last time he would push Jesus to the edge and then play the same trick again for the last time, “if you are the Son of God …..”

If we have been challenged by others when we have power in our hands, let us first remember that getting us to accept a challenge after reminding us of our position or power, is not God’s way of doing things.
Let us always be alert to the tricks played by the devil through the people around us, by staying in touch with the scriptures every day.

Jesus had only a few moments before His death but Satan was still trying his luck to drag Jesus into his kingdom.
If Satan didn’t spare the Son of God till the end then we the creatures should not expect that Satan will spare us.  We must therefore be alert to sin until the last moment of our lives.  If we try to avoid violence, Satan will use our loved ones to lead us on his path.

Matthew 28:6
Faith in the resurrection is based on divine revelation, and not on the empty tomb. The resurrection cannot be tested or verified in a laboratory.  Also, there are no eye witnesses to prove how Jesus rose from the dead and exactly what time.  But there were witnesses who saw Jesus die and they also saw Him after the resurrection.

Matthew 28:12-15
It is surprising that the Jews never thought of asking how it could be possible that all soldiers fell asleep together when they were supposed to be on duty? And if all the soldiers were asleep then who saw the disciples taking the Body of Jesus?

Matthew 28:19
*“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations …..”*
Jesus didn’t make evangelization optional and Jesus was not speaking of political nations.  Jesus was speaking of ethnic groups which create their own gods and their own beliefs.

*“……. baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”*
By this command Jesus gave us the Sacrament of Baptism to restore the divine life within us (the life of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit), which Adam and Eve had destroyed in the Garden of Eden, by making a Covenant with Satan when they committed the first mortal sin.

Matthew 28:20
*“I will be with you always until the end of time.”*
Jesus fulfills that promise by dwelling with us in the new Covenant Tabernacles in the Church until we receive Him in Communion.  Thereafter He dwells within us and gives us divine life (John 14:23) until we commit a sin.

### Indifference and Apathy

[![Indifference and Apathy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day267.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4_15qozDj0A "Indifference and Apathy")

### Day 267 The return from exile

When the Lord wills something it will happen, just a word is spoken from the Lord and things happen. The Israelites have been in exile for 70 years – which is a couple of generations when the Lord causes the King of Persia, Cyrus to declare freedom to the Israelites.

1 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom, and also in a written edict declared:
2 “Thus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem in Judah. 3 Any of those among you who are of his people—may their God be with them!—are now permitted to go up to Jerusalem in Judah, and rebuild the house of the Lord, the God of Israel—he is the God who is in Jerusalem; 4 and let all survivors, in whatever place they reside, be assisted by the people of their place with silver and gold, with goods and with animals, besides freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.” Ezra 1
Can you imagine, if you were waiting on something for generations – like immigration status and you were given the news that the President himself has granted you and your family approval? It would have been music to the ears of many, but we can also see many who had gotten used to living in exile and didn’t want to return. Can you imagine how God works, the people were asked to go back home and even given supplies and valuables – gold and silver.
Now as the people came back and were settling down, they started contributing towards the restoration of the temple.
68 As soon as they came to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the heads of families made freewill offerings for the house of God, to erect it on its site. 69 According to their resources they gave to the building fund sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly robes. Ezra 2

As the people settled in, we see that they have forgotten about the house of the Lord. Their focus shifted to their own houses, and they have forgotten the house of the Lord.
You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the Lord of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses. 10 Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. 11 And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors. Haggai 1

Let us always be aware of the house of the Lord, of the church’s needs, and do everything we can to support our churches. This message comes in a day and age where churches and schools are closing in the western world due to lack of attendance. Hopefully, we as a human race will wake up and return home to church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Rebuilding the Temple

[![Rebuilding the Temple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day268.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CVYwsdZYNoM "Rebuilding the Temple")

### Day 268 Sloth

What is sloth? Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work. Physical sloth is plain and simple laziness, not wanting to do any work or study or chores. Everyone has some amount of Sloth in them, given a chance – people would live in filth. Laziness is fueled by luxury and comfort, one does not want to get off the couch to get the house tidy. Laziness can result in families facing financial problems.

4The lazy person does not plow in season; harvest comes, and there is nothing to be found. 5 The purposes in the human mind are like deep water, but the intelligent will draw them out. Prov 20:4,5

However bad Physical sloth may be, it’s not as bad as Spiritual sloth. Spiritual Sloth can lead us to Spiritual death. One can go to Mass every Sunday and still not pray, just going through the Mass without praying is disrespectful to Jesus in the Eucharist. Jesus is present Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity in the Eucharist – He looks forward to entering our hearts and soul every time we receive communion.

Sloth is the desire for ease, even at the expense of doing the known will of God. Whatever we do in life requires effort. Everything we do is to be a means of salvation. The slothful person is unwilling to do what God wants because of the effort it takes to do it. Sloth becomes a sin when it slows down and even brings to a halt the energy we must expend in using the means to salvation.

Sloth can prevent us from doing God’s will because we are so lazy and do not want to pray. Some people think that they will be saved by virtue of being baptized. Although we are saved by what Jesus did for us on the cross, we cannot take it for granted and do nothing. We are called to pick up our cross and follow him daily. We are called to work out our salvation with trembling. Not sit and do nothing. We are called to pray and to know the Lord. We are called to be led by the Spirit and not just be dormant.

12 Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.Phil 2

Another form of laziness is being overly busy or preoccupied with many things, that we forget to pray. Sometimes we can be so busy doing God’s work that we even forget our own salvation.
Like those folks who did many things for the Lord but didn’t really do the will of God. To know the will of God we need to have a relationship with God and spend time listening to the Holy Spirits' guidance.

21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ 23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 268 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 4:4-5
*Then the people of the land (the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin) discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build (the Temple).  The adversaries bribed officials to frustrate the plan of the Jews throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.*

The Judah and Benjamin tribes were doing the work of God but the enemies were not happy so they stopped the Jews from re-building the Temple.

Whenever we get busy with God’s work Satan will always stir up his disciples to either stop the work or mess it up.

But the obedience of the Jews had won God’s favour (Ezra 5:5).  The issue was resolved and the work resumed.

As long as we obey God’s commandments He will always send His angels to support us so that we can continue His work, and Satan’s evil plans will be foiled.

### The Day of Small Things

[![The Day of Small Things](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day269.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8vlMnuM1frc "The Day of Small Things")

### Day 269 Your words and actions only expose what’s in your heart.

Even children make themselves known by their acts, by whether what they do is pure and right. Prov 20:11

This is so simple and so true, our actions reveal who we really are. We sometimes do not know who we really are, we may think we are all good and don’t need help until we mess up. But God knows us well and still loves us.

Jesus taught that the mouth speaks what the heart is full off.
43 “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45 The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks. Luke 6:43-45

Sometimes we can put on a mask and try to be good in front of people, but our truth can never be covered up all the time. Usually, the close family knows the true nature of the person. Also, certain circumstances and situates will reveal the person.

If we like to do some self-examination, we can keep track of our words and actions and this will reveal the state of our hearts. We can also keep track of our thoughts and see know what we are thinking all the time. These will help us know who we really are and we can work on our weaknesses.

Sometimes we have a hidden nature, this nature is revealed when we have a certain opportunity or are faced with a certain situation. For example, a husband may have never imagined that he would be physically violent, but when his wife kept fighting with him, he snapped and hit her. This hidden nature is revealed, and he feels ashamed. We store a lot of good and bad memories in our subconscious mind – which shape our personality. We sometimes struggle with certain sins because of our past, we may not even remember what happened to us as children – but it impacts us. A good inner healing retreat will help.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### God's Favor with Ezra

[![God's Favor with Ezra](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day270.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Wq96tM44tAo "God's Favor with Ezra")

### Day #270 Two ways to trust in the Lord.

We see two different approaches that Nehemiah and Ezra take to prayer and trusting in God. Both of them had a similar situation – they needed to journey and in the days of Kings – one would need a small band of armed soldiers to safely travel. The two took two different approaches – Ezra was ashamed to ask the King for protection because he said that the Lord God will protect him.

21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might deny ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions. 2
2 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and his wrath are against all who forsake him. 23 So we fasted and petitioned our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty. Ez 8:21-23

Nehemiah goes the route of praying that the King will send a cavalry with him and it did happen, the King granted his request.

4 Then the king said to me, “What do you request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. 5 Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ graves, so that I may rebuild it.” 6 The king said to me (the queen also was sitting beside him), “How long will you be gone, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a date. 7 Then I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may grant me passage until I arrive in Judah; 8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, directing him to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.” And the king granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me.
9 Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and cavalry with me. Nehemiah 2: 4-9

Sometimes in life, we are faced with a situation where we need to trust the Lord. We can take either route of praying that God Himself will take care of us and we will be safe, or we could pray that God will use people in authority to keep us safe.
For example, some people could have such strong faith that they feel that God will heal them Miraculously and stop taking medicine or don’t go for surgery.
There is also another kind of people that say that God will heal them with medicines and surgery and they pray that God will guide the hands of the doctor.
Now none of us will ever know what is the right method, but all of us know that we cannot limit the way God works. God can heal us directly with a Miracle and also can use doctors and medicine to heal us.
The important thing to remember is that God is the source of everything good, as long as we trust in him – it does not matter what route we take – if we ask for an army or if we blindly trust the Lord to protect us.
Our Faithful God will always protect us, we need to be sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to know what route to take.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Israel's Foreign Wives

[![Israel's Foreign Wives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day271.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vxEtEDgtKQw "Israel's Foreign Wives")

### Day #271 Is your marriage making you holier?

The person you marry, can either make you holier or lead you away from the truth. We all know that marriage is the union of two souls, the two are united not just emotionally and physically but also spiritually. Ezra was able to clearly notice how those Israelites with mixed marriages we being led away from the true God. There were several warnings from the Lord and instructions to not marry outside the Israelite community. Not that the others were second class, but the Jews were God’s chosen people, and salvation was going to come from them.

9 After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2 For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way.” 3 When I heard this, I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled. Ezra 9: 1-3

By marrying the other people -the Israelites are slowly taking on idol worship and other practices that are forbidden. They are becoming unclean and committing grave sin.

10 “And now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations. They have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.Ezra 9:10-11

It finally came to the point where Ezra commanded the Israelites to separate from their foreign wives and children. We need to pay attention that this is Ezra’s instruction – not sure if he waited on the Lord for instruction. It was a case-by-case decision – where they determined if the separation was needed.
Of course, God does not like divorce, it is made clear by Jesus’s own words.

8 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”Mat 18:8-9

So the takeaway for us is the question – Is our marriage making us holy or taking us away from God?
God’s design is for marriage to be a small trinity, Husband-Wife-God. Children are a fruit of a good marriage. We should pray for our spouses and help them become the best version of themselves. And if your marriage is abusive or preventing you from following Christ – the Church is always there to guide you and help you with the annulment process.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 271 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 9:5-9
Ezra, in his humility, was counting himself as one among his sinful brothers even though he stayed out of mortal sin.
Like Ezra, we too must refrain from pointing our finger at the sins of others as if to say that we are sinless.

Zechariah 9:9-10
This was an image of a future king who would stop war and bring peace.
It was an image of Jesus whose power comes, not from this world but, from the Father above.  Jesus will bring peace in the world, not by using force or magic, but by spreading love and mercy through His people, the Christians.

### The Call of Nehemiah

[![The Call of Nehemiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day272.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zbvENgoZvbw "The Call of Nehemiah")

### Day #272 Grace not Vengeance.

When someone does something to us, the first thing that we want to do is get back at them, hurt them back or do something even eviler. An eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth makes the whole world blind. The wisdom of the proverbs calls for us to refrain from retaliating and becoming like the person who did evil in the first place.

Do not say, “I will repay evil”; wait for the Lord, and he will help you. Prov 22:20

We need to wait for the Lord to help us and to help the person who hurt us. If we keep doing evil for evil, this will escalate and cause a really evil world. We have to pray for God’s help so that we can do good to those who do bad to us. We should pray that we are able to bless those who curse us. Pray for the strength to turn the other cheek, walk the extra mile, and to forgive the wrongs done to us.
Forgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts you.
When someone hurts you or does wrong to you, it actually is a prayer that they are making – by their evil actions they are making a prayer – a prayer that says “Hey!! I have evil in my heart, please pray that God will give me the grace to overcome it”.
So the next time you feel offended, take a breath, prayer a bit, and let God help you. Do not avenge the action but pray for God’s grace in the other person’s life.
Just as God the father, cried over the pierced one. God could have taken vengeance on the human race and wiped out every single one of us. But God had Mercy instead of Vengeance on us.

10 And I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that, when they look on the one whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. Zechariah 12:10

We should get strength when we gaze at the crucifix, strength to forgive. He was stricken for our inequities and bruised for our offenses.
May we be moved to compassion and forgiveness, not to vengeance. Let us pray for God’s grace in everyone’s life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### The Lord's Work

[![The Lord's Work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day273.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2qNdSZ_oPQc "The Lord's Work")

### Day #273 Who is my neighbor?

We seem to be stuck with a bunch of names again in Nehemiah although it may seem boring to read them, we need to remember that it was a lot of people doing the work of the Lord. Everyone decided to leave their regular work and they picked up tools to build the wall. The high priest were only supposed to offer sacrifice at the temple, they were dedicated to the service of the Lord. Yet they took up common tools to build the wall, to do the will of the Lord.
Even though we see this massive effort to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem and the whole city was involved. We also read about those nobles who thought that doing a menial task like building a wall was below their dignity.

5 Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord. Nehemiah 3:5

We need to check our hearts and see if we are open to doing anything the Lord may call us to do.
We are called to be servants and not masters, we should be like Jesus – who came not to be served but to serve. Let us pray that our hearts be open and willing to do any little thing the Lord asks us to do. We should be open to all tasks for example: cleaning the church floor, visiting people in prison, going out of our way to talk to the person who everyone else ignores.
We may not all be called to be great preachers and evangelists – but are certainly called to be a witness at our workplace, home and friend circle. Let us be prepared to do anything the Lord asks of us because most of the time, these small acts of kindness are what bring people to Christ.
We also read how many people were only building the wall in front of their houses and were possibly not concerned for their neighbors or those in need.

28 Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one opposite his own house. 29 After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs. 30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.

We are living in a very “meWorld” and everything revolves around my wants and needs. My house, my children, my health, my family, my car, my parish, my group, my, my, my..

Our Christian calling is to live as a community, we should not just think of ourselves all the time, or else we will be like the priest who ignored the traveler in the parable of the good Samaritan.
We will be like those in the final judgment narration who failed to see Christ in the poor, the hungry, and the naked. We will end up asking the question

‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ Mat 25:44

We will end up like the rich man who was not able to see the needs of Lazarus the poor beggar who sat hoping to get the crumbs that fell from his table.

Let us not only build the walls near our homes but build the walls of the city of God. Let us not say things like – that’s the work of the clergy or that’s not my calling or someone else will do it.
Let us be the hands and feet of Christ, let us not hide our light under the bushel basket but set it on a high place for the people to see our light and praise our creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
