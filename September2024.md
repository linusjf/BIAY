### The Faithfulness of Daniel

[![The Faithfulness of Daniel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day245.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YyoM96UAEYw "The Faithfulness of Daniel")

### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” 5 He answered, “Because I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.”
6 The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?” 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.” Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, “See, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.” 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.” 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!”
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. “Look at the floor,” he said, “and notice whose footprints these are.” 20 The king said, “I see the footprints of men and women and children.”
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.” 25 Daniel said, “I worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 245 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, “Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

### Rejoice in Doing Good

[![Rejoice in Doing Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day246.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mwmk2EmKf8M "Rejoice in Doing Good")

### Day #246 God does not resentfully help us but rejoices in doing good to us.

When we commit sin our natural tendency is to stop praying or to run away from God. One tries to avoid a God encounter because we have hurt our all-loving God. We feel that God is upset with us and is very angry with us, we try to associate the experience that we had as children. Children tend to avoid their parents when they have made a mistake, knowing that they will be punished for the wrongs. This has been written so deep into us that we try to run away from God when we sin, we try to hide like Adam and Eve. We try to cover up our shame and hide our mistakes from God, but God knows it all. God knows us better than we know ourselves, we may run but can never escape God.
On the contrary, we should run to God, because He is a loving, merciful, and forgiving God. When Adam and eve committed sin, they were hiding but God came in search of them. Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the Lost sheep. When Peter denied Jesus 3 times, Jesus did not rebuke him but offered him another chance, he entrusted him with being the shepherd of the flock again. Our God is different from anything we have ever experienced, God wants to forgive us and give us another chance. God does not do this out of reluctance but rejoices to do us good.
I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.Jer 32:14
There is great rejoicing when one sinner repents than over 99 who did not need to repent. God loves the sinner and understands us, Jesus took on this weak human nature and knows how frail we truly are.
The next time you need forgiveness, do not run away but run towards the Lord. He is waiting with arms wide open.
Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:19
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 246 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 32:40
*I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The old Covenant did not have a provision for renewal because a price has to be paid by a priest, with holy blood, to make atonement, whenever God's Covenant is broken. Therefore it was not an everlasting Covenant.

The new Covenant is everlasting because Jesus, our High Priest, paid the price by offering His physical holy blood, once for all. Thereafter, whenever we break the new Covenant with our sins, God renews it through the Sacrament of Reconciliation and when we receive the sacramental Body and Blood of Christ (Communion), which was offered by an Apostolic priest, in atonement for our sins.

### True Repentance

[![True Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day247.jpg)](https://youtu.be/brdYj4UPNfw "True Repentance")

### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.” John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Cut to the Heart

[![Cut to the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day248.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jJ24ExMKoFc "Cut to the Heart")

### Day #248 Does suffering make you bitter or better?

The proverb in today’s reading hits the nail on the head about suffering and testing. Fine metals are made pure by heating in the furnace and shaped by hammering when red hot. The human heart is made pure by testing and suffering.

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Prov 17:3

Today we see how the Rechabites have been faithfully following the instructions of their fathers, to not drink wine. They were testing and passed the test.

We need to ask ourselves: will we pass the test? Let’s read.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:

2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. 3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 4 I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Have some wine.” 6 But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; 7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.’ 8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”

12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the Lord. Jer 33:1-13

In the book of Judith, we see the Israelites in distress, they have been surrounded by their enemies for 35 days now and are running low on supplies. The water in their cisterns is drying up and people are fainting on the streets due to thirst. They came to the point of giving up and wanted to surrender. They were willing to surrender and become slaves of the enemies. But then the word of the Lord came to Uzziah and he encouraged them to hold on a little longer for 5 more days.

29 Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice. 30 But Uzziah said to them, “Courage, my brothers and sisters! Let us hold out for five days more; by that time the Lord our God will turn his mercy to us again, for he will not forsake us utterly. 31 But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do as you say.”
32 Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their town. The women and children he sent home. In the town they were in great misery. Judith 7: 29-32

As we continue to read the book of Judith, we will see how God saves them from their enemies. The lesson to learn today from them is to keep strong in times of suffering, trusting God and knowing that we just need to hold on a little longer for help is on the way. Let us be encouraged by this story from the bible, even if we are weak and fainting and see no way out – if we want to give in and surrender to the enemy – we should not. Stay strong, stay brave, for you are under testing, the Lord will soon bring you help.

You are precious to the Lord like gold is precious to people. The Lord is refining you by testing. Your suffering is meant to help you grown in holiness.

But does your suffering make you bitter or better?

Don’t worry if you answered bitter, you could get better. You will have many more chances of suffering and testing and hopefully we can become better. When we encounter suffering let us praise God and offer up our suffering for those who need our prayers. Our bitter will slowly become better.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Prayer of Judith

[![Prayer of Judith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day249.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f27psD92Kv8 "Prayer of Judith")

### Day #249 Setting a deadline for our petitions is like putting God to the test.

Who said beauty, wisdom, and goodness cannot be found together in a woman, we have a heroine from the Old Testament “Judith” who has all these qualities.

We are all aware of the long-suffering they were going through, people are fainting due to lack of drinking water. Uzziah come up with a hack of an idea to wait for 5 more days and if God does not come to their aid, they would surrender. Judith was witnessing all this commotion and holds them to the truth.
Judith and the Elders

9 When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days, 10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town. 11 They came to her, and she said to them:
“Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. 12 Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs? 13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything! 14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God. 15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies. 16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading. 17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him. Judith 8:9-17

Yes, indeed we cannot set a timeline for God to work, they were setting a timeline of 5 days for God to answer their prayers. Which is nothing but putting God to the test, it’s like throwing God a challenge – if you don’t answer our prayers in 5 days we will surrender. Judith in her wisdom brought out this aspect of testing God and saved the Israelites from going into slavery.
Sometimes we need to be aware that we are putting God to the test when we pray prayers like, “Please give me a job within this month” or “Heal me at service today”.

Our attitude should be more like – “Lord I offer my prayer to you and know you can do things instantly but if you want me to bear this cross longer so be it."

We should not be making prayers like bribes – “If you answer this petition, I will donate $1000”.
Our prayers should be prayers of faith, thanking God for what we are asking for, and knowing that He will grant what is best for us in His time. -Michael Eltham

We should stop putting deadlines to our prayers to be answered, building character, faith and trust is more important than results.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 249 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 38:4–6
*Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”  King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”  So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.*

Jeremiah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Some centuries later Jesus also went through a similar experience.
Like Jeremiah and Jesus, Christians also may have to go through a similar experience during their lifetime.
When the Word of God is preached the evil one gets very disturbed and he therefore stirs up his disciples to block the Word from reaching millions of people by getting rid of the preachers.

### Final Wave of Exile

[![Final Wave of Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day250.jpg)](https://youtu.be/U8IW-EHokos "Final Wave of Exile")

### Day #250 Choosing God’s will or the easy way out?

We are reading about the final exile of the Israelites, the fall of Jerusalem. Now the captain of the guard of Jeremiah must have seen something in him or must have recognized that this prophet is truly from God. He offers to take Jeremiah with him and to keep him comfortable.
2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster; 3 and now the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said, because all of you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice. Therefore this thing has come upon you. 4 Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you; but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. 5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. 6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land. Jeremiah 40:2-6
If anyone of us were given this offer, we may have chosen to go with the captain. Now Jeremiah was not a person to seek out an easy life, all he wanted to do was "the will of God". He decides to stay with the poor in desolate Jerusalem.
Let us learn a life lesson from this prophet Jeremiah, that the most important thing to do is the will of the Lord. In life, we will be given multiple options, and more often than not, we tend to pick what is easy over the right thing to do.
Let’s look at a couple of examples.

1. If you go to the store and your kid hides a toy and does not check it out, would you go back to the store and tell them what happened or just say “these stores overcharge us – it’s good we got to take something from them”
2. If your teenage kid comes back to you and says she is pregnant, would you allow her to have an abortion or ask her to raise the kid and learn a life lesson.
   Hopefully, we will have the courage to do the will of God, when we are faced with these hard decisions in our lives.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judith and Holofernes

[![Judith and Holofernes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day251.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vPnfDIwTaZY "Judith and Holofernes")

### Day #251 Drunkenness can cause you to let your guard down.

It’s worth reading the whole episode on how Judith kills Holofernes.
Judith Attends Holofernes’ Banquet
10 On the fourth day Holofer′nes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite any of his officers. 11 And he said to Bago′as, the eunuch who had charge of all his personal affairs, “Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us. 12 For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us.” 13 So Bago′as went out from the presence of Holofer′nes, and approached her and said, “This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnez′zar.” 14 And Judith said, “Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!” 15 So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman’s finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofer′nes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bago′as for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.
16 Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofer′nes’ heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her. 17 So Holofer′nes said to her. “Drink now, and be merry with us!” 18 Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born.” 19 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared. 20 And Holofer′nes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.
13 When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bago′as closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master’s presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long. 2 So Judith was left alone in the tent , with Holofer′nes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.
3 Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bago′as. 4 So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, “O Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. 5 For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us.”
6 She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofer′nes’ head, and took down his sword that hung there. 7 She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!” 8 And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body. 9 Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holofer′nes’ head to her maid, 10 who placed it in her food bag. Judith 12: 10-16, 13:1-10
Although it’s not an explicit sin to drink alcohol, alcohol can open the door to other sins. When you consume alcohol in excess you let down your guard and would do things you wouldn’t normally do. Although drinking alcohol is not a sin, drunkenness is a grave sin that will not permit you to go to heaven.
Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor: 9,10
We read in today’s readings that Holofernes drank much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born. This led to him letting his guard down and gave Judith an opportunity to strike his head with a sword and kill him.
Let us all pray for the virtue of temperance, it the virtue that will help us avoid any kind of excess whether it be food drink or tobacco.
The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. CCC 2290
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Queen of Heaven

[![Queen of Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day252.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XJfmBfWX_7Y "Queen of Heaven")

### Day #252 The Queen of Heaven

As we read Jeremiah, the goddess with the title “Queen of Heaven” comes up a lot. Given the fact that the catholic church gives Mary the title “Queen of heaven” can be confusing. If you take the title out of context then it can seem confusing. However there are many differences that are very obvious, first Mary is not a goddess she is human. The Queen of heaven spoken about in Jeremiah was an idol, it’s talking about idol worship.

6 “As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 18 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”

The Israelites stopped listening to the word of God that Jeremiah spoke and even stopped burning incense to the idol. They are confused that they are in a poor state because they stopped burning incense to the idol. However, the real reason is that they stopped worshiping the true God of Israel.

When it comes to the title of Queen of heaven for Mary, the first thing is she is not a goddess or an idol. She is just a human being chosen by God to partner with God to bring salvation to the world. She is the daughter of Abba father, the spouse of the Holy Spirit and the mother of Jesus. In the Jewish kingdom, the queen was always the mother, because the kings had many wives.

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.

And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus’ dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1

May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are “I am a handmaid of the Lord”, “My soul magnifies the Lord”, and “Do as he says, listen to him”. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Queen of heaven intercede for us as we try to understand scripture.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Jeremiah 43:1-3
*When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to settle there’; but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.”*

The Jews did not want to obey God's Word and they were afraid to accuse God's anointed prophet (Jeremiah) directly so they accused Jeremiah's secretary, Baruch, of inciting Jeremiah to give them false messages thus making him a false prophet.  This was the only way they could defend their disobedience to God's Word.  This was a hypocritical defence on their part because earlier they had taken an oath that they would obey the Lord always, irrespective of whether the message was easy or difficult to follow (Jeremiah 42:5-6).

Like those Jews, sometimes we too twist the wrong to make it look like the right so that we can defend our wrongdoings, and thus we make the good ones look like the bad ones.

Jeremiah 43:13
*He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt.*

An obelisk is a tapering stone pillar, typically having a square or rectangular cross section, set up as a monument or landmark.  It was a symbol of the fertility of Egypt.

Jeremiah 44:1-30
A dispute broke out as to why the city of Jerusalem had been defeated in battle (v. 2-3).  One side (Jeremiah) declared that it was punishment from Yahweh (God) for the sinners who had worshipped the false Queen of Heaven; while another side (the Israelites) insisted that military defeat occurred because people had stopped worshipping the Queen of Heaven.
The Queen of Heaven was most probably the false goddess Astarte, because the Mesopotamians worshipped the same goddess by offering baked cakes, but they called her “Ishtar.”

It was the idolatry of the people that brought devastation to the nation and their lives, not the cessation of idolatry.

God wants us to worship Him by following a liturgical pattern, which includes offering to Him incense and baked cakes/wafers and pouring out libations to Him as a perpetual statute until the end of time (Exodus 29:38-42).  The Israelites were following the same liturgical pattern but to worship the false goddess (v.17 & 19).
God is a loving Father and therefore He provides us with our daily needs irrespective of whether we ask Him or not, just as our earthly father would provide for us even if we were unproductive or disobedient.  It is not Satan or the false gods who provide for our survival.

The Israelites connected their earthly pain and gain with the deity they worshipped, but the spiritual reality is opposite.

When we walk on the right path towards God’s Kingdom, worshipping the living God and obeying all His Commandments, Satan is not happy and therefore he works 24x7 to destroy our souls by destroying our peace and happiness with persecution and/or constant suffering (Revelation 12:17), in and out of our homes, to mislead us into believing that our misfortunes are due to the living God who we worship.  But God allows Satan to create those problems and sufferings in our lives to heal us spiritually.
On the other hand, when we walk on the wrong path Satan is very pleased and therefore he will not create any major crisis in our lives so that we are comfortable and happy.  He may create small problems in our lives to mislead us into believing that those are the crosses which Jesus wants us to carry and we start believing that we are walking on the right path.

If we focus on our earthly peace and happiness, we end up making wrong decisions and moving forward on the wrong path, which is exactly what Satan wants us to do.
The Israelites were making the same mistake.

The people attributed their prosperity to the queen of Heaven when, in reality, it was God who was blessing them with prosperity.

Sometimes we too are like those people.
We attribute our success to our benefactors on earth and we forget that it is God who makes it possible for them to help us prosper.  We go out of our way to give them so much importance that we won't even think twice about cancelling our time with God (Sunday Mass, daily prayers, etc.) to attend to our benefactors and please them.

### Lamentations of Jeremiah

[![Lamentations of Jeremiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day253.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SDKW8fEUP44 "Lamentations of Jeremiah")

### Day #253 Let our lamentations be prayers to Christ.

As we read the book of lamentations, we can only imagine the suffering that Baruch experienced. It is not just statements of the bad situations but it’s more like prayers rising up to God.

“See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. ” Lam 1:20

When you see your children in need of something and we cannot do anything to help them, it breaks every parent's heart. The children of Israel are destitute and there is no one who can comfort them.

“This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”
Our usual response when we go through suffering is “why me Lord” or "What did I do wrong" or we end up focused on the suffering and say "Earlier It was much better", "I was able to do this/that" or "I should not have done this or that" .

Suffering on earth is inevitable and everyone will go through various suffering on earth. We have to train ourselves to accept suffering, to voice our prayers to the Lord, to be able to lament and offer up our sufferings for the salvation of souls. We should not only focus on the why of things or how to get out of suffering, but we have to be able to live in suffering and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort us when we go through difficult times.

Difficult times make us stronger, and the Lord is always with us. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, so don’t hesitate to lament and talk to the Lord about those hard things you are facing.

Ps 34: 18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
We should unite our suffering to the suffering of Christ, for the salvation of the world.
12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 1 Pet 4: 12-13

We should not be surprised that we have suffering in our lives, we should rejoice that we are able to participate in the sufferings of Christ. Even if the suffering seems like a lot, we need to remember that the Lord will not permit anything we cannot handle, and there will always be a way out. So let us accept our sufferings, lament and pray, and be united to Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judgment of Nations

[![Judgment of Nations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day254.jpg)](https://youtu.be/AHlUaRhb2Mc "Judgment of Nations")

### Day #254 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing personal opinion.

Have you ever met those kinds of people, who want their voices heard? They don’t respect the conversation or the person but would cut you off and say only what they want. These are the people who have an opinion and don’t want to change it at any cost. Having an argument with such people is meaningless for they don’t want to understand or listen – they just want to voice their opinions. They will even twist the truth to win an argument. I’m sure you have a list of people who fall under this category, and if you find yourself on the list don’t worry the Holy Spirit will help you.
Here is some practical advice from the book of James.

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. James 1:19

Let us become good listeners, let us not be quick to judge but take time to listen, understand, ask questions, and pray about everything. We should be slow to react, slow to reply and prudent in what we speak.
Words are like bullets, once shot they will never come back.
Take your time to polish every word before you speak.

We are God’s children and our words carry weight, just as God’s words bring action even our words can affect positively or negatively. We should be very careful what we say for every word we speak is recorded, we will need to give an account of every careless word we speak.

Matthew 12:36 “But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an account for it in the day of judgement.”

Let us clean up our speech, let us speak words that we are comfortable speaking to God. Let us stop all hate speech, gossip, slander, negative talk, and mean words. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen, let us understand and not just speak our heads off. Let our words be words of love and care, words that will lift up people, and that will build community.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Hard Seasons

[![Hard Seasons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day256.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qZ_Bi8I-VXA "Hard Seasons")

### Day 256 The Lord is a strong tower

The safest place in this world is in the arms of Abba Father. There are so many dangers that we face in our life, right from the time we are born till we die – there are dangers on all sides. We can meet with an accident, be part of a shooting on the road, we can get infected by a dangerous virus, can lose our job and livelihood. There are so many things that can go wrong, and bad things can happen to us. There is no need to fear everything around us all that is needed is for us to run to safety, for the Lord is a strong tower those who run to Him will be safe.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe. Prov 18:10
The key is "run to God" and to stay in the presence of the Lord, to stay in friendship with God.

You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 2 will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.” 3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence; 4 he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. 5 You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day, 6 or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, or the destruction that wastes at noonday. Ps 91:1-6

We need to live in the shelter of God and abide in the shadow of the Almighty. We can find refuge under his wings and God’s faithfulness will be our shield and buckler. Even if we are faithless the Lord will be faithful and protect us from all harm and danger.
God will put his angels in charge of us and they will patrol around us – we will not even dash our foot against the stone, and not even a hair will be lost unless the Lord permits it.

11For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. 12 On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone. Ps 91:11,12

And

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. Ps 34: 7
Let us not fear, as we have angels around us protecting us from all harm and danger.

I met with two accidents in my life and on both occasions – I did not get seriously hurt.
I am sure that God placed angels around me and protected me at the time of those accidents. It’s also important to recognize that we have been saved from many accidents in life even without our own knowledge.
So let us all run to the Lord our strong tower and be safe in His arms.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Choose to Love

[![Choose to Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day257.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JqRK-YQxun8 "Choose to Love")

### Day 257 We should try to love our extended family

The book of Obadiah is the only 1-chapter book of the Old Testament. One of the main things that come up is the enmity between distant family. Jacob and Esau fought and reconciled – however, their descendants grew strangely apart.

For the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob,
shame shall cover you,
and you shall be cut off forever.
11 On the day that you stood aside,
on the day that strangers carried off his wealth,
and foreigners entered his gates
and cast lots for Jerusalem,
you too were like one of them.
12 But you should not have gloated over your brother
on the day of his misfortune;
you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah
on the day of their ruin;
you should not have boasted
on the day of distress. Ob 1:10-12

This could be the challenge most of us are facing as well, loving family – especially distant family can get tough. It could be something that happened generations ago and the family ends up not talking to each other or rejoicing when the other family fails. If we have this nature of rejoicing over other people's failures, we need to check our hearts for jealousy, hatred and revenge.

Forgiveness is at the heart of the Christian life and we are able to forgive, but the wounds may be deeper.

For Example: If you grew up listening to your Mom saying that your Dad’s side of the family is very sly stay away - it could be hard to know the truth as you have been brainwashed.
Or For Example: If your single Dad told you to never reach out to your mom because she does not care about you, it could be hard for one to cross that bridge and understand both sides of the story.

We all have a complex history in our families and may never be able to under the negative wiring we have, however, all hope is not lost. We need to allow the Holy Spirit to heal us and make us better people. We should pray for a just heart, a heart that is pure and guided by the Holy Spirit. A heart that cares and does not judge or rejoice when your enemies fail.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 258 St Joseph our model

We have been journeying with the Israelites for what seems like centuries and millions of people. As we read the Genealogy of Jesus we know a few more names because of our “Bible in a year” experience. We also recognize that not everyone in the genealogy of Jesus is perfect, we read their stories, but God is able to draw a straight line with our crooked lives. We recognize that there are women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar who bore a child to her father-in-law (re-read day 20), Ruth (The Non-Jew), and Bathsheba(remarried due to King David’s sins), the ancestors of Jesus were not perfect people – however, the Lord makes all things new in Jesus.
Let us take courage when we find ourselves in sin or have bad ancestors or family. We just need to trust the Lord and do good, He will make all things new.
St Joseph was such a just and humble man, that when he was confronted with the decision to be the guardian of the Savior, he felt unworthy and decided to divorce Mary. He was instructed in a dream that it was indeed God’s plan for him to be the foster father of Jesus.
St Joseph’s dream would have been confirmed when baby Jesus received gifts from the wise men, the Gold symbolized his Royal Kingly line. The Frankincense revealed that he would be of priest and offer sacrifices, however, the Myrrh would have been the most difficult to understand and it was used to embalm the dead bodies. However, this was just symbolic of His death and resurrection. It must have been hard being baby Jesus’ parents, that’s why Mary pondered all these things in her heart.
Joseph became "the savior of the savior" when we had to flee with the Holy Family to Egypt. He protected that family in Egypt and brought them safely back when Herod died. St Joseph is given the title "the terror of demons" because even when he sleeps he communicates with God in dreams.
Let us learn from St Joseph to be humble, discerning, and docile to the will of God. Dream like St Joseph.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 258 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 1:1-17
The genealogy of Jesus has Jews and gentiles which means it needs the unity of Jews and gentiles to birth the complete Body of Christ, the Kingdom of God.
By linking Jesus to Abraham through David, Matthew wants to show his Jewish audience that Jesus is the royal Messiah, the divine Son of the promise.
David is spelt DVD in Hebrew, and the numerical value is 14 ( D=4, V=6).  That is why Matthew has shown the ancestry of Jesus to Joseph in groups of 14.
The Gospel according to Matthew was written for the Jews.

Matthew mentions four women in the genealogy.
All four women were not Jews.  They were either gentiles or associated with gentiles.
Tamar and Rahab were Canaanites, Ruth was a Moabite, the tribe with which God had forbidden the Israelites from intermarrying, and Bathsheba had been married to a Hittite before David.
Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba were not very clean in character.
Tamar’s two sons were conceived through an illicit relation with Judah;
Rahab was running an establishment of ill repute.
Bathsheba had an adulterous relation with King David.

The people of the Judah tribe were also descendants of these same four women.
Matthew was preparing the Jews to receive a Saviour who was criticized for hanging around with gentiles and sinners because they themselves were the descendants of gentiles and sinful people.  They were also the descendants of illicit relations.
Matthew also shows that Jesus came to redeem not only the Jews but also the gentiles.
Matthew also shows that Jesus was the rightful heir to the Davidic throne as Joseph’s legal son (Luke 2:21), and Mary’s biological son (Romans 1:3).

Matthew begins his genealogy from Abraham who was the Father of Judaism

The first century Jews believed that Solomon was the chosen Messiah for Israel.
Therefore, after the Resurrection of Jesus there were conflicts within Jewish families where some Jews in the family accepted Jesus and the others did not.
Matthew, being aware of the situation around him, split the genealogy of Jesus to show the Jews that if Solomon could be accepted as the Messiah even though he was an offspring of an adultrous affair, and a descendant of non-Jewish women, of which two were women of ill repute, and then why couldn't Jesus, who was born of a virgin mother, be accepted as the Messiah?

Matthew 1:20
*“Joseph son of David.”*
Joseph's father was Jacob, not David, but the angel was reminding Joseph of his royal lineage, his dynastic line, because all descendants of David were generally referred to as “sons and daughters of David.”
The angel was reminding Joseph that the Messiah was going to be from the lineage of David, and since Joseph was a descendant of David, he fitted the role as father of the Messiah.

Matthew 1:21
*“You are to name Him Jesus."*
The one who gives the name is the owner or controller of the recipient, just as God named the light “day” and darkness “night” (Genesis 1:5), the dome “sky” (Genesis 1:8), the dry land “earth” (Genesis 1:10), etc., and just as Adam named all the living creatures (Genesis 2:19-20).
Giving Joseph the authority to name Jesus meant giving Joseph the authority to be the one who controls Jesus, the Son of God, and yet Joseph never misused his authority.

Matthew 1:24-25
*When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; he took her into his home as his wife and he had no marital relations with her until she bore a son.*
Matthew’s emphasis was on the virgin birth which was according to the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:22-23).  Matthew wrote for a Jewish audience and therefore he wanted to make it known that the baby was purely from the Holy Spirit and not from Joseph.

Accepting a pregnant woman as his wife would bring Joseph a lot of shame and scorn because it would now be believed that he was the man who fathered the child before marriage, which means that Joseph had broken the law.  But Joseph was willing to sacrifice his respect to save Mary.
This is where Jesus learnt about sacrificial love.

*About Joseph.*
Joseph was called a righteous man because he was obedient to the Will of God.  He carried out his duties as a father and a spouse perfectly.
Joseph is mostly painted as an old man because most people find it hard to believe that a young man could remain chaste inspite of being married to a pretty young woman.
If we cannot agree that Joseph was a young man, then we do not know what true sacrificial love is.  That is where Jesus got His values from.
Joseph knew how to master his desires, which is why he is called "righteous."
Joseph reminds us that we can do God's work even when we are working silently in the background.

Matthew 2:12
*Then they returned to their country by another road because God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.*
The magi were experts in interpreting dreams so they knew exactly what the dream meant and how important it was.  Also, they had seen how disturbed Herod was when he heard the news of the new king.

What can we learn from the magi ?

1. They were men who read and believed the Word of God.
2. They started on a journey looking for Jesus.
3. They recognized the kingship and priesthood of the Messiah and therefore presented him with the appropriate gifts, the best of what they had.
4. They humbled themselves to worship Jesus inspite of their high position in society.
5. They obeyed God and not men.
   They were truly wise men.
   The magi were not only seekers, but, most importantly, they were finders.
   They did not stop looking for Jesus until they found Him and the star led the wise men to Jesus.
   Let us become like this special star, and guide many people to Jesus.
   Like the wise men, let us not stop looking for Jesus until we find Him.

Matthew 3:9
*“Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.”*
Our God who is leading His Kingdom on earth (His Church) today, is able to raise priests and missionaries from the stones of the Cathedral / Church.
Some years ago we didn’t even imagine that the Word of God would be preached through different online platforms, which is now made available to millions of God’s children.  God gave us the social media well in advance before Covid hit the globe.  God is magnificently guiding the evangelization ministry through social media, creating new opportunities to reach people.
Having the DNA of Abraham is not a guarantee for salvation and neither is Baptism.

Matthew 3:13-17
*Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything. During His baptism Jesus (the sinless man) was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give Him the means by which He could impart to us the Holy Spirit which we were lacking in due to original sin, and He gives the Holy Spirit to us through our Baptism.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.
God always begins a new creation with water and Spirit, a symbol of baptism (Genesis 1:2; Genesis 8:10-11; Exodus 14:22).
Likewise Jesus started the new creation with His baptism.

*And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”*
God is very pleased, not only when Jesus was baptized, but also when any human is baptized.  Baptism is a gift from God, given with love, to make us members of His family and it makes Him very happy whenever a human accepts His gift, just as it makes us happy when someone accepts our gift given with love.

Matthew 4:1-11
Satan tried to tempt Jesus because Satan wanted Jesus to abandon His mission so that humanity would be trapped in sin forever.
If Satan didn't spare the Son of God, then we have no reason to believe that Satan will spare us.

Satan promised to return to Jesus all creation which belongs to Jesus but without suffering.
Satan tempts humanity with this offer of wealth, comfort and pleasure without suffering, even today.

Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly and obey God's Commandments, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us.

Jesus was alone in the wilderness when the devil attacked Him.
The devil's strongest instrument is our isolation from family. He therefore starts by breaking families with divorce, fights for possessions, etc. and then starts working on attacking each soul separately.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.
Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Temptations are God’s way of training us for spiritual warfare.
A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.
Similarly, we cannot fight the spiritual enemy (Satan) by leading comfortable lives.

To be able to win a physical battle, a soldier of the country has to undergo constant physical training and practice of the use of physical weapons.
Similarly, to be able to win a spiritual battle, a soldier of Christ must undergo constant spiritual training to stay out of sin with daily prayer, reading the Word of God, regular repentance and reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist (Communion), etc. and practice the use of spiritual weapons (peace, love, understanding, patience, humility, kindness, generosity, etc.).

Satan offered 3 shortcuts to Jesus to increase the number of His followers.
*The first shortcut:*
*The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”*
In other words, do whatever you think is right in your eyes; no rules, forget duty, only remember your rights and your desires, etc.

*The second shortcut:*
*Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;*
In other words, humans love excitement and surprises. They love anything that makes them say "vow" even if they forget it after a week.  So perform some magic here and there to keep them entertained and they will follow you.

*The third shortcut:*
*Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”*
In other words, Theology is boring. It only talks about suffering. It encourages living in poverty. It tells you not to retaliate when someone insults or humiliates you.  So forget theology and get involved in politics in whichever field you may be, whether in school, at work, in a religious community, or anywhere else, and do whatever it takes to reach the top and have power in your hands, even if you have to hurt some people along the way.

What shortcuts do we take in our lives to increase the number of our likes, followers, viewers and subscribers?

Matthew 4:19
*I will make you fishers of men.*
Why only fishers and not hunters?
Jesus called His first disciples “fishers” because He wanted them to first focus on finding the Israelites who were scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing.  The gentiles/lost tribes, living in the woodlands, would be found later by the “hunters” (Jeremiah 16:16).  After His resurrection Jesus sent Saul/Paul on the mission to bring the gentiles/lost tribes into the Church.

### The Sermon on the Mount

[![The Sermon on the Mount](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day259.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fXSy0DsEnak "The Sermon on the Mount")

### Day 259 Do not be anxious, isn’t life more than food and clothes

At the start of the sermon on the mount, Jesus sets the scene when he goes up the mountain and sits down. In the OT going up the mountain was almost always an indication of a God experience – here the people meet God in the person of Jesus Christ. In the OT the teachers would sit down to teach – unlike in our modern culture where they stand up to preach, so when Jesus sat down, they know He will be teaching. Jesus is the new Moses who gives us the new law of love. Moses brought the ten commandments written on stone tablets and Jesus was the word of God himself - the word written on our hearts – he spoke those beautiful beatitudes – not just the law but the life – Jesus tells us what we need to do to be happy.
One thing that steels happiness is anxiety. We are a generation that is worried and anxious about too many things. We are constantly thinking about tomorrow, what we will eat and what we wear. It seems that we are overly concerned about earthly matters and achievements. We seem to forget the more important things like our soul and our prayer life.
The Lord reminds us that He is in control of our lives, He feeds us just as He feeds the birds of the air that are there today and gone tomorrow. Would not the Lord cloth us, He would cloths the lilies of the field.
25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?28 And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith?
31 Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32 For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
34 “So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.
Mat 6:25-34
The best way to rid ourselves of anxiety would be to know our relationship with God. He is a Good Father who takes care of his children.
9 Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone? 10 Or if the child asks for a fish, will give a snake? 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Let us shun all our anxiety because we are children of Abba Father who cares for us. In Jesus we have this beautiful relationship – we are made bold enough to cry out “Abba Father”.
Our father in heaven will supply every need of ours, let us not forget to pray. We will receive our daily bread.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### DAY 259 By Sheila

Matthew: ln Matthew we learn to love our enemies those whom we consider unworthy of our love and affection. It is precisely in loving, the love of God surpasses way beyond human norms of acceptability. The Father's Love is given to the good and the unpleasant and is humbling. God never withdraws His Love for us just because we did something that is not right.

The Our Father we say is To God, Our Father whom we can relate to, with sheer intimacy, veering away from pagan ways of praying. Jesus wants us to come to God as a child approaches his father, a whole new way experience of Divine nearness to burst out our hearts desires.

```text
Don't worry, don't be anxious and don't be too preoccupied. Set our hearts on the Kingdom of God and all other things will be given.

Sadly, in our faith life, many tend to despise the things which require time. We have become so impatient whenever God seems to delay His response to our prayers. We are accustomed to instant life, an easy way and the urgency to wait. Thus lost the thrill of choosing the Narrow Gate which requires careful discernment, endurance and let God be God.
```

Proverbs: therefore teaches us to choose life, love, whose price is far above and encourages devotion and perseverance with a deeper loyalty.

### BIAY Day 259 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Matthew 5:1-12
Jesus is uniquely qualified to answer what happiness is because, he made us with His divine nature, so he knows what will fulfill us; and with His human nature he experienced the most perfect happiness possible, so we can follow him to the same destination.
At the dawn of our race, there was a great shipwreck, and among the things that went down with the ship was the human heart. So damaged was the human heart by the wound of original sin that its full potential for happiness and love remained largely unknown until Jesus came with the instruction manual for the human heart, namely, “the Beatitudes.”

While men were vainly seeking happiness in wealth, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are the poor in spirit.”
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the fleeting pleasures of the emotions, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are those who mourn.”
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the esteem of men, Jesus came with the instruction “blessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you.”
Truly, the human heart is counterintuitive, and without Jesus we could not have found happiness on our own. We were like flies vainly seeking the light of the sun through a windowpane when the way out was an open door through the darkness right behind us.

In this sermon Jesus teaches us how to live a true Christian life.

In the old Covenant, the righteous people were blessed with material wealth and prosperity.
In the new Covenant, the righteous people may or may not be blessed with prosperity in this life but they will definitely be blessed with prosperity in Heaven if they take up their cross and endure through their suffering to the end (Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23).

Jesus showed us the meaning of the beatitudes by living His life in accordance with His teaching.  The beatitudes are a spiritual profile of Jesus Himself. He wants us to follow His example.
The devil has a million ways to drag us into his kingdom. Jesus wants us to be alert to sin in everything we do and say.

Matthew 5:3
The poor in spirit are those who are humble, and depend upon God completely for everything good, bodily and spiritual. They have three qualities in common:

> > they all trust in God to provide for their needs;
> > they are all detached from wealth or honor; and
> > they all love God more than wealth or honor.

Matthew 5:16
The sanctity of the world depends totally on the sanctity and obedience of Christians to the teachings of Christ, and not so much on the sanctity of non-Christians who have not heard of Jesus but are leading holy lives.
And when the world is sanctified, God is glorified.
Jesus did not focus only on maintaining the sanctity of His soul.  While maintaining the sanctity of His soul, Jesus focused on bringing others to God.
We too must do the same.
If we live our Christian lives in a state of grace at all times, then the world will be sanctified and God will be glorified because the percentage of faithful Christians will be far greater than the percentage of non-believers.

Jesus came to bring light to the world.
As followers of Christ we must use the scriptures to dispel our own darkness first and then the darkness in others.
If we have any confusion we can always ask the Lord for His help.

Like the Olympic Torch bearers, God required the Patriarchs to carry His light  through thousands of years across the world.
Like the Patriarchs, we too can become torch bearers and carry the light of Christ to the world around us.  We don't need to run several miles like the Olympics Torch bearers. We can do it from where we are.

We don't do good works to gain merits.
We must do good works because good works are part of God’s plan for salvation of the entire world and God uses His children to accomplish His divine plan.
When we help or pray for those in need we become the instruments through whom God works. We can enter into God's divine plan for salvation through prayer, good works or suffering.

Matthew 5:17
The old law was not perfect because it could not purify the souls of the people.
“He abolished the old (sacrifice) in order to establish the new (sacrifice)” (Hebrews 10:9).
By His life, death and resurrection, Jesus fulfilled the shadows of the old Religious Law and gives Himself to us through the sacraments to purify our souls.

Matthew 5:20
Jesus was not speaking against the scribes and Pharisees.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees was real but it was earthly, human and natural, and it was based on the Mosaic Law.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees could only discipline God's people to make them good citizens of the earthly Jerusalem.  It could not purify their conscience/souls.  But the Law of Christ makes us saints of the heavenly Jerusalem because it purifies our conscience/souls through the sacraments.
Therefore, as a new Covenant people, our righteousness must go beyond the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, not against it.

Matthew 5:21-22
The old law said “do not kill” (Exodus 20:13).
But Jesus did not just forbid murder. Murder was already forbidden in the old law.  Jesus forbade us from using harsh or insulting words when speaking to others so that our anger does not progress to hatred, hatred does not progress to revenge, and revenge does not progress to murder.  Jesus wants us to nip the evil in the bud.
It is not wrong to be angry when someone has offended us but we must not allow our anger to progress to sinful words and actions.

Matthew 5:23-24
Before offering our gift / sacrifice at the Altar, Jesus wants us to make peace with everyone around us and change our anger, hatred, enmity into love because we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor (everyone around us).
If we have anger, hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness against anyone then we cannot have union with the Lord at the Altar and all our fasting, almsgiving, prayer, etc. is all a waste.

Matthew 5: 27-32
In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church.  Physical adultery and divorce are symbols of spiritual adultery and divorce.
In a spiritually adulterous relation we (the Church) abandon our spouse (Jesus) and join with our lover (Satan) when we commit mortal sins.  Therefore, Jesus forbade adultery and divorce.

Matthew 5:38-39
*“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also;”*
If God had allowed the ancient form of justice to continue till the end of time then, at the speed with which violence is increasing in today’s world, by the end of time two thirds of humanity would probably have no eyes and teeth.
Jesus softened the law by introducing forgiveness because retaliation doesn't create peace and security around us.

Development of morality in salvation history:
After the fall of man, Cain could avenge 7 times.
Moses could avenge equal times (an eye for an eye).
Prophets preached that mercy was as important as justice.
Jesus said, "love your enemies; forget vengeance and forgive 70 times seven; leave the vengeance to God.  If enemy repents then God will forgive them too."

Due to man’s sinful nature, it took thousands of years for God to forbid retaliation totally and bring humanity down to this level.

Matthew 6:1-2
Hypocrites are not only those who make a public show of their good deeds.
When we profess our faith in Christ but don’t live our lives like Christ then we are hypocrites.
When we pray The Lord’s Prayer on one side, and live with a grudge against our offenders and speak ill about them on the other side, then we are hypocrites.

Matthew 6:5
Synagogues were places where the Law was explained to the people (Acts 13:13-16) and they were taught how to apply it to themselves in their daily lives.  They also sang the psalms.  The Jews never prayed or worshipped God in the Synagogues.  Worship was strictly reserved to be only in the official Temple where the sacrifice was offered (John 4:20).  The hypocrites prayed on the streets and in the Synagogues because those were the places where there were crowds of people and the hypocrites wanted people to see them praying.

There is no harm in praying at home with our families but additionally Jesus wants us to spend time with God in solitude, every day, just as He did.   There is also no harm in gathering with people outside homes to pray as long as we are not making a show of it for personal gain.

Matthew 6:6
Prayer is not about giving God information. It is an activity he wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.
We don't pray to God to change His mind to do our will.
We pray to God to change our mind to do His Will.
By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

Matthew 6:7-8
Jesus was condemning the heathen's/pagan's repetitive prayers because :

1. their prayers were not made to the living God.
2. their prayers did not include praise and thanksgiving to the living God.
3. their prayers did not have any repentance and request for forgiveness.
   Repetitive prayers made to the living God are not condemned by God (Daniel 3:25-45; Daniel 3:51-90; Psalm 118:1-4; Psalm 136:1-26; Matthew 26:44).
   Our prayers to the living God must always begin with praise, thanksgiving for blessings received and repentance for sins committed.  This may or may not be followed by our petitions.

Matthew 6:10
Jesus taught us to pray, “May Thy Kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done”,
But how can God's Kingdom (Heaven) come down on earth if we, Christians, remain silent and worry about our own comfort and reputation when we see people around us doing sinful things?

Matthew 6:24
*You cannot serve two masters.*
God does not want our divided attention, that is, 50% with the Church and 50% with the world.  He wants us to surrender ourselves to Him totally, which is 100%.

Matthew 6:33
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers, unless we are in a critical condition and cannot pray).
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God’s Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Matthew 7:1-5
When we remove the log from our eye, we will notice that what was in our brother's eye was only a splinter. It is not wrong to hate someone else's sins and expect them to correct themselves. But it is definitely wrong if we are only focusing on correcting others and not correcting our own errors. Our holiness must not be in comparison with other humans. Our holiness must be in comparison with Jesus, which no human can surpass but we must try to get as closer to Him, in holiness, as possible.

Matthew 7:21-23
*“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.*
What is the will of our Father in heaven?
God's Will is that we must worship Him the way He wants us to and to obey all the teachings of Christ which are:
A)  repentance (Luke 24:47);
B)  caring for others, specially the poor and needy (Matthew 9:13);
C)  serving God by serving others (Matthew 20:26-28).

*On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many deeds of power in your name?’  Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers.’*
Those people had been given the power to prophesy and perform miracles, and yet they were not allowed to enter Heaven.

That is because the Holy Spirit gives us two types of graces:
(1) charismatic or natural grace, and;
(2) sanctifying grace.
Sanctifying grace is the saving grace (Ephesians 2:8) and those who do not have this grace when they die are the ones whom Jesus says He will reject, even though the Lord may have done many good works through them through their charismatic or natural grace.
We must therefore ensure that we are in a state of grace at all times.

Matthew 7:21
*Faith and works.*
Works are not meant to earn our way to Heaven.
Every Christian has an obligation to allow the Holy Spirit in them to do good works for the growth of the Church and the salvation of the world thus becoming the salt and light of the world while they make sure they maintain their own holiness.

Matthew 7:24-25
*“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.  The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock.*
There will definitely be storms in the life of a Christian because our faith must be tested.  But the question to ask is not "will there be a storm in my life?" The question to ask is "when the storm hits my life, will I be spiritually ready for it?"
