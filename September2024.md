### The Faithfulness of Daniel

[![The Faithfulness of Daniel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day245.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YyoM96UAEYw "The Faithfulness of Daniel")

### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” 5 He answered, “Because I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.”
6 The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?” 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.” Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, “See, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.” 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.” 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!”
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. “Look at the floor,” he said, “and notice whose footprints these are.” 20 The king said, “I see the footprints of men and women and children.”
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.” 25 Daniel said, “I worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 245 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, “Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

### Rejoice in Doing Good

[![Rejoice in Doing Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day246.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mwmk2EmKf8M "Rejoice in Doing Good")

### Day #246 God does not resentfully help us but rejoices in doing good to us.

When we commit sin our natural tendency is to stop praying or to run away from God. One tries to avoid a God encounter because we have hurt our all-loving God. We feel that God is upset with us and is very angry with us, we try to associate the experience that we had as children. Children tend to avoid their parents when they have made a mistake, knowing that they will be punished for the wrongs. This has been written so deep into us that we try to run away from God when we sin, we try to hide like Adam and Eve. We try to cover up our shame and hide our mistakes from God, but God knows it all. God knows us better than we know ourselves, we may run but can never escape God.
On the contrary, we should run to God, because He is a loving, merciful, and forgiving God. When Adam and eve committed sin, they were hiding but God came in search of them. Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the Lost sheep. When Peter denied Jesus 3 times, Jesus did not rebuke him but offered him another chance, he entrusted him with being the shepherd of the flock again. Our God is different from anything we have ever experienced, God wants to forgive us and give us another chance. God does not do this out of reluctance but rejoices to do us good.
I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.Jer 32:14
There is great rejoicing when one sinner repents than over 99 who did not need to repent. God loves the sinner and understands us, Jesus took on this weak human nature and knows how frail we truly are.
The next time you need forgiveness, do not run away but run towards the Lord. He is waiting with arms wide open.
Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:19
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 246 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 32:40
*I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The old Covenant did not have a provision for renewal because a price has to be paid by a priest, with holy blood, to make atonement, whenever God's Covenant is broken. Therefore it was not an everlasting Covenant.

The new Covenant is everlasting because Jesus, our High Priest, paid the price by offering His physical holy blood, once for all. Thereafter, whenever we break the new Covenant with our sins, God renews it through the Sacrament of Reconciliation and when we receive the sacramental Body and Blood of Christ (Communion), which was offered by an Apostolic priest, in atonement for our sins.

### True Repentance

[![True Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day247.jpg)](https://youtu.be/brdYj4UPNfw "True Repentance")

### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 “Therefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the Lord—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.” John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Cut to the Heart

[![Cut to the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day248.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jJ24ExMKoFc "Cut to the Heart")

### Day #248 Does suffering make you bitter or better?

The proverb in today’s reading hits the nail on the head about suffering and testing. Fine metals are made pure by heating in the furnace and shaped by hammering when red hot. The human heart is made pure by testing and suffering.

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Prov 17:3

Today we see how the Rechabites have been faithfully following the instructions of their fathers, to not drink wine. They were testing and passed the test.

We need to ask ourselves: will we pass the test? Let’s read.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:

2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. 3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 4 I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Have some wine.” 6 But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘You shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; 7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.’ 8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’ That is why we are living in Jerusalem.”

12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the Lord. Jer 33:1-13

In the book of Judith, we see the Israelites in distress, they have been surrounded by their enemies for 35 days now and are running low on supplies. The water in their cisterns is drying up and people are fainting on the streets due to thirst. They came to the point of giving up and wanted to surrender. They were willing to surrender and become slaves of the enemies. But then the word of the Lord came to Uzziah and he encouraged them to hold on a little longer for 5 more days.

29 Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice. 30 But Uzziah said to them, “Courage, my brothers and sisters! Let us hold out for five days more; by that time the Lord our God will turn his mercy to us again, for he will not forsake us utterly. 31 But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do as you say.”
32 Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their town. The women and children he sent home. In the town they were in great misery. Judith 7: 29-32

As we continue to read the book of Judith, we will see how God saves them from their enemies. The lesson to learn today from them is to keep strong in times of suffering, trusting God and knowing that we just need to hold on a little longer for help is on the way. Let us be encouraged by this story from the bible, even if we are weak and fainting and see no way out – if we want to give in and surrender to the enemy – we should not. Stay strong, stay brave, for you are under testing, the Lord will soon bring you help.

You are precious to the Lord like gold is precious to people. The Lord is refining you by testing. Your suffering is meant to help you grown in holiness.

But does your suffering make you bitter or better?

Don’t worry if you answered bitter, you could get better. You will have many more chances of suffering and testing and hopefully we can become better. When we encounter suffering let us praise God and offer up our suffering for those who need our prayers. Our bitter will slowly become better.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Prayer of Judith

[![Prayer of Judith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day249.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f27psD92Kv8 "Prayer of Judith")

### Day #249 Setting a deadline for our petitions is like putting God to the test.

Who said beauty, wisdom, and goodness cannot be found together in a woman, we have a heroine from the Old Testament “Judith” who has all these qualities.

We are all aware of the long-suffering they were going through, people are fainting due to lack of drinking water. Uzziah come up with a hack of an idea to wait for 5 more days and if God does not come to their aid, they would surrender. Judith was witnessing all this commotion and holds them to the truth.
Judith and the Elders

9 When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days, 10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town. 11 They came to her, and she said to them:
“Listen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. 12 Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs? 13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything! 14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God. 15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies. 16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading. 17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him. Judith 8:9-17

Yes, indeed we cannot set a timeline for God to work, they were setting a timeline of 5 days for God to answer their prayers. Which is nothing but putting God to the test, it’s like throwing God a challenge – if you don’t answer our prayers in 5 days we will surrender. Judith in her wisdom brought out this aspect of testing God and saved the Israelites from going into slavery.
Sometimes we need to be aware that we are putting God to the test when we pray prayers like, “Please give me a job within this month” or “Heal me at service today”.

Our attitude should be more like – “Lord I offer my prayer to you and know you can do things instantly but if you want me to bear this cross longer so be it."

We should not be making prayers like bribes – “If you answer this petition, I will donate $1000”.
Our prayers should be prayers of faith, thanking God for what we are asking for, and knowing that He will grant what is best for us in His time. -Michael Eltham

We should stop putting deadlines to our prayers to be answered, building character, faith and trust is more important than results.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 249 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 38:4–6
*Then the princes said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.”  King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”  So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.*

Jeremiah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Some centuries later Jesus also went through a similar experience.
Like Jeremiah and Jesus, Christians also may have to go through a similar experience during their lifetime.
When the Word of God is preached the evil one gets very disturbed and he therefore stirs up his disciples to block the Word from reaching millions of people by getting rid of the preachers.

### Final Wave of Exile

[![Final Wave of Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day250.jpg)](https://youtu.be/U8IW-EHokos "Final Wave of Exile")

### Day #250 Choosing God’s will or the easy way out?

We are reading about the final exile of the Israelites, the fall of Jerusalem. Now the captain of the guard of Jeremiah must have seen something in him or must have recognized that this prophet is truly from God. He offers to take Jeremiah with him and to keep him comfortable.
2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster; 3 and now the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said, because all of you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice. Therefore this thing has come upon you. 4 Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you; but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. 5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. 6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land. Jeremiah 40:2-6
If anyone of us were given this offer, we may have chosen to go with the captain. Now Jeremiah was not a person to seek out an easy life, all he wanted to do was "the will of God". He decides to stay with the poor in desolate Jerusalem.
Let us learn a life lesson from this prophet Jeremiah, that the most important thing to do is the will of the Lord. In life, we will be given multiple options, and more often than not, we tend to pick what is easy over the right thing to do.
Let’s look at a couple of examples.

1. If you go to the store and your kid hides a toy and does not check it out, would you go back to the store and tell them what happened or just say “these stores overcharge us – it’s good we got to take something from them”
2. If your teenage kid comes back to you and says she is pregnant, would you allow her to have an abortion or ask her to raise the kid and learn a life lesson.
   Hopefully, we will have the courage to do the will of God, when we are faced with these hard decisions in our lives.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judith and Holofernes

[![Judith and Holofernes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day251.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vPnfDIwTaZY "Judith and Holofernes")

### Day #251 Drunkenness can cause you to let your guard down.

It’s worth reading the whole episode on how Judith kills Holofernes.
Judith Attends Holofernes’ Banquet
10 On the fourth day Holofer′nes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite any of his officers. 11 And he said to Bago′as, the eunuch who had charge of all his personal affairs, “Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us. 12 For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us.” 13 So Bago′as went out from the presence of Holofer′nes, and approached her and said, “This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnez′zar.” 14 And Judith said, “Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!” 15 So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman’s finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofer′nes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bago′as for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.
16 Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofer′nes’ heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her. 17 So Holofer′nes said to her. “Drink now, and be merry with us!” 18 Judith said, “I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born.” 19 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared. 20 And Holofer′nes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.
13 When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bago′as closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master’s presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long. 2 So Judith was left alone in the tent , with Holofer′nes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.
3 Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bago′as. 4 So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, “O Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. 5 For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us.”
6 She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofer′nes’ head, and took down his sword that hung there. 7 She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, “Give me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!” 8 And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body. 9 Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holofer′nes’ head to her maid, 10 who placed it in her food bag. Judith 12: 10-16, 13:1-10
Although it’s not an explicit sin to drink alcohol, alcohol can open the door to other sins. When you consume alcohol in excess you let down your guard and would do things you wouldn’t normally do. Although drinking alcohol is not a sin, drunkenness is a grave sin that will not permit you to go to heaven.
Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor: 9,10
We read in today’s readings that Holofernes drank much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born. This led to him letting his guard down and gave Judith an opportunity to strike his head with a sword and kill him.
Let us all pray for the virtue of temperance, it the virtue that will help us avoid any kind of excess whether it be food drink or tobacco.
The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. CCC 2290
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Queen of Heaven

[![Queen of Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day252.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XJfmBfWX_7Y "Queen of Heaven")

### Day #252 The Queen of Heaven

As we read Jeremiah, the goddess with the title “Queen of Heaven” comes up a lot. Given the fact that the catholic church gives Mary the title “Queen of heaven” can be confusing. If you take the title out of context then it can seem confusing. However there are many differences that are very obvious, first Mary is not a goddess she is human. The Queen of heaven spoken about in Jeremiah was an idol, it’s talking about idol worship.

6 “As for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 18 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”

The Israelites stopped listening to the word of God that Jeremiah spoke and even stopped burning incense to the idol. They are confused that they are in a poor state because they stopped burning incense to the idol. However, the real reason is that they stopped worshiping the true God of Israel.

When it comes to the title of Queen of heaven for Mary, the first thing is she is not a goddess or an idol. She is just a human being chosen by God to partner with God to bring salvation to the world. She is the daughter of Abba father, the spouse of the Holy Spirit and the mother of Jesus. In the Jewish kingdom, the queen was always the mother, because the kings had many wives.

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.

And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus’ dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1

May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are “I am a handmaid of the Lord”, “My soul magnifies the Lord”, and “Do as he says, listen to him”. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Queen of heaven intercede for us as we try to understand scripture.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 252 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 43:1-3
*When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, “You are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to settle there’; but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.”*

The Jews did not want to obey God's Word and they were afraid to accuse God's anointed prophet (Jeremiah) directly so they accused Jeremiah's secretary, Baruch, of inciting Jeremiah to give them false messages thus making him a false prophet.  This was the only way they could defend their disobedience to God's Word.  This was a hypocritical defence on their part because earlier they had taken an oath that they would obey the Lord always, irrespective of whether the message was easy or difficult to follow (Jeremiah 42:5-6).

Like those Jews, sometimes we too twist the wrong to make it look like the right so that we can defend our wrongdoings, and thus we make the good ones look like the bad ones.

Jeremiah 43:13
*He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt.*

An obelisk is a tapering stone pillar, typically having a square or rectangular cross section, set up as a monument or landmark.  It was a symbol of the fertility of Egypt.

Jeremiah 44:1-30
A dispute broke out as to why the city of Jerusalem had been defeated in battle (v. 2-3).  One side (Jeremiah) declared that it was punishment from Yahweh (God) for the sinners who had worshipped the false Queen of Heaven; while another side (the Israelites) insisted that military defeat occurred because people had stopped worshipping the Queen of Heaven.
The Queen of Heaven was most probably the false goddess Astarte, because the Mesopotamians worshipped the same goddess by offering baked cakes, but they called her “Ishtar.”

It was the idolatry of the people that brought devastation to the nation and their lives, not the cessation of idolatry.

God wants us to worship Him by following a liturgical pattern, which includes offering to Him incense and baked cakes/wafers and pouring out libations to Him as a perpetual statute until the end of time (Exodus 29:38-42).  The Israelites were following the same liturgical pattern but to worship the false goddess (v.17 & 19).
God is a loving Father and therefore He provides us with our daily needs irrespective of whether we ask Him or not, just as our earthly father would provide for us even if we were unproductive or disobedient.  It is not Satan or the false gods who provide for our survival.

The Israelites connected their earthly pain and gain with the deity they worshipped, but the spiritual reality is opposite.

When we walk on the right path towards God’s Kingdom, worshipping the living God and obeying all His Commandments, Satan is not happy and therefore he works 24x7 to destroy our souls by destroying our peace and happiness with persecution and/or constant suffering (Revelation 12:17), in and out of our homes, to mislead us into believing that our misfortunes are due to the living God who we worship.  But God allows Satan to create those problems and sufferings in our lives to heal us spiritually.
On the other hand, when we walk on the wrong path Satan is very pleased and therefore he will not create any major crisis in our lives so that we are comfortable and happy.  He may create small problems in our lives to mislead us into believing that those are the crosses which Jesus wants us to carry and we start believing that we are walking on the right path.

If we focus on our earthly peace and happiness, we end up making wrong decisions and moving forward on the wrong path, which is exactly what Satan wants us to do.
The Israelites were making the same mistake.

The people attributed their prosperity to the queen of Heaven when, in reality, it was God who was blessing them with prosperity.

Sometimes we too are like those people.
We attribute our success to our benefactors on earth and we forget that it is God who makes it possible for them to help us prosper.  We go out of our way to give them so much importance that we won't even think twice about cancelling our time with God (Sunday Mass, daily prayers, etc.) to attend to our benefactors and please them.

### Lamentations of Jeremiah

[![Lamentations of Jeremiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day253.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SDKW8fEUP44 "Lamentations of Jeremiah")

### Day #253 Let our lamentations be prayers to Christ.

As we read the book of lamentations, we can only imagine the suffering that Baruch experienced. It is not just statements of the bad situations but it’s more like prayers rising up to God.

“See, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. ” Lam 1:20

When you see your children in need of something and we cannot do anything to help them, it breaks every parent's heart. The children of Israel are destitute and there is no one who can comfort them.

“This is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.”
Our usual response when we go through suffering is “why me Lord” or "What did I do wrong" or we end up focused on the suffering and say "Earlier It was much better", "I was able to do this/that" or "I should not have done this or that" .

Suffering on earth is inevitable and everyone will go through various suffering on earth. We have to train ourselves to accept suffering, to voice our prayers to the Lord, to be able to lament and offer up our sufferings for the salvation of souls. We should not only focus on the why of things or how to get out of suffering, but we have to be able to live in suffering and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort us when we go through difficult times.

Difficult times make us stronger, and the Lord is always with us. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, so don’t hesitate to lament and talk to the Lord about those hard things you are facing.

Ps 34: 18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
We should unite our suffering to the suffering of Christ, for the salvation of the world.
12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 1 Pet 4: 12-13

We should not be surprised that we have suffering in our lives, we should rejoice that we are able to participate in the sufferings of Christ. Even if the suffering seems like a lot, we need to remember that the Lord will not permit anything we cannot handle, and there will always be a way out. So let us accept our sufferings, lament and pray, and be united to Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Judgment of Nations

[![Judgment of Nations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day254.jpg)](https://youtu.be/AHlUaRhb2Mc "Judgment of Nations")

### Day #254 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing personal opinion.

Have you ever met those kinds of people, who want their voices heard? They don’t respect the conversation or the person but would cut you off and say only what they want. These are the people who have an opinion and don’t want to change it at any cost. Having an argument with such people is meaningless for they don’t want to understand or listen – they just want to voice their opinions. They will even twist the truth to win an argument. I’m sure you have a list of people who fall under this category, and if you find yourself on the list don’t worry the Holy Spirit will help you.
Here is some practical advice from the book of James.

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. James 1:19

Let us become good listeners, let us not be quick to judge but take time to listen, understand, ask questions, and pray about everything. We should be slow to react, slow to reply and prudent in what we speak.
Words are like bullets, once shot they will never come back.
Take your time to polish every word before you speak.

We are God’s children and our words carry weight, just as God’s words bring action even our words can affect positively or negatively. We should be very careful what we say for every word we speak is recorded, we will need to give an account of every careless word we speak.

Matthew 12:36 “But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an account for it in the day of judgement.”

Let us clean up our speech, let us speak words that we are comfortable speaking to God. Let us stop all hate speech, gossip, slander, negative talk, and mean words. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen, let us understand and not just speak our heads off. Let our words be words of love and care, words that will lift up people, and that will build community.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
