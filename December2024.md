### The Council at Jerusalem

[![The Council at Jerusalem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day336.jpg)](https://youtu.be/i9JLabc1K1E "The Council at Jerusalem")

### BIAY Day 336 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 15:2
*No less dissention.*
This was Luke's polite way of saying that there was a huge explosive argument due to disagreement, that it almost led to a quarrel.
The members of the council didn't end up in dividing the Church in response to the difference of opinion.  They made a common decision and then abided by that decision.  That is the principle of an ecumenical council.

Acts 15:1-12
*Why was there a huge debate in the early Church?*

Paul’s refusal to impose the Mosaic Law upon the gentile converts, provoked very strong objection from the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem.  This was one of the common problems in almost all the first century Churches (Romans 3:21-31; Galatians 3:1-5).\
For more than a thousand years they were given to understand that, according to the Mosaic Law, an uncircumcised man, along with his family, cannot be part of God’s family (Genesis 17:12-14).

Although they understood that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism, they were unable to understand why the gentiles were being baptized and allowed into the Churches, without being circumcised.

When the Jewish Christians from the sect of Pharisees started spreading the wrong message, it created confusion within the entire Church.
This topic led to a huge debate between the Apostles and the priests, until Peter stood up during the Council at Jerusalem, and in his authority as the Pope / Prime Minister of God’s Kingdom (the Church), he made the final decision, through the power of the Holy Spirit, that people could now enter the Church and be part of God’s family through faith followed by baptism, not circumcision.\
Thus baptism replaced circumcision.

The purpose of showing Peter the vision (Acts 10:9-16) and sending him to preach to Cornelius and his household earlier (Acts 10:19-20), and thereafter to baptize them (Acts 10:48), was to teach Peter that the Mosaic rituals were soon to be replaced with new rituals.  With the Cornelius event in mind, the Holy Spirit may have also reminded Peter that before the Ascension, Jesus did not command them to circumcise all nations, but to baptize them.

Therefore, Paul’s refusal to impose the Mosaic law on the gentile Christians was supported by Peter on the ground that within his own experience God bestowed the Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household without pre-conditions concerning the adoption of the Mosaic law.

Satan always uses his disciples to create problems and confusion, but God allows those problems to teach us how to move forward on the right path, and we will do well if we live in obedience to God’s commandments.

The Apostles had not addressed this issue earlier, therefore by allowing this problem in the Church God was teaching the Apostles how to organize and develop the Church, just as God allowed problems in the House of Israel to teach Moses how to organize and develop his community (Exodus 18:19-24; Numbers 11:16).

Debates and problems in the Church between the bishops and the clergy are common and are required to help the Church grow. These are times of trial which we must go through for purification and growth. When there's a difference in opinion, a meeting is called and the debate begins with a prayer for guidance from the Holy Spirit. After the debate a common decision is arrived at.
The important thing is that the Church remained unified inspite of the debate.

When the Church is challenged by heresies then it becomes necessary to hold a council and come to a decision in order to protect the faith of its entire congregation.

However, when the faith of a minority is shaken by heresies, then the Bishop may resolve the issue through epistles as Paul did.

The council at Jerusalem was the first council held by the Church but not the only one.  Thereafter many councils have been held, as and when the need arose.

The *Mosaic Civil law* was not required to be followed universally because it applied only to Israel.  Therefore, it was eventually deleted.
However, the *Mosaic Religious and Moral laws* must be followed by the subjects (the Christians) of the holy Kingdom, and therefore cannot be deleted.  They were however gradually modified with the guidance of the Holy Spirit to suit the new Covenant requirement due to the change in priesthood (Hebrews 7:12).
Acts 15:7-21
Peter spoke on behalf of everyone and gave a doctrinal pronouncement about what the Church believes (Acts 15:7–12) because Peter was the first Pope / Prime Minister, and James gave a practical solution (Acts 15:13–21) because James was the Bishop of Jerusalem.

The Apostles (bishops) and presbyters (priests), in agreement with the whole Church (the laity), wrote a letter to the gentile Christians with their decision which became the new Law of the Church (Acts 15:22–29).

<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/7%E2%80%9312>
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/13%E2%80%9321>
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/22%E2%80%9329>

1 Corinthians 11:10
*For this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.*
This is a warning that gender confusion and improper attire, during worship, will offend the heavenly hosts. Angels are ministers of the natural order and angels are present during the sacramental worship of the Church (Hebrews 12:22). Therefore it is important that we stand in front of the Altar with modest clothing.

1 Corinthians 11:26
*For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.*
Paul, and the other Apostles, always ended the proclamation of the Gospel with breaking of the bread (Mass).

“Proclaiming the Gospel” means that during every (Mass) the Christians must re-live the ministry of Christ on earth from the baptism of Jesus to His resurrection, where the Priest represents Christ and the congregation represents the first disciples of Christ during His ministry on earth.

“Proclaiming the Gospel” includes :

> > )  forgiving the people’s sins (through the Penitential Rite);
> > )  glorifying God (The Gloria).
> > )  reading the scriptures from Old & New Testament, Psalms & Prophets;
> > )  preaching the Gospel;
> > )  teaching the people how to apply the Gospel to their lives with reference to the readings of the day (through the homily);
> > )  consecrating the bread and wine and offering them to God as a perfect sacrifice in atonement for sins (anamnesis / re-living the Upper Room and Calvary events); and,
> > )  celebrating the Resurrection by eating the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ (Communion) (re-living the post resurrection events) (Luke 24:30).

1 Corinthians 11:27-30
Paul uses judicial language because when we receive the Body of Christ in an unworthy manner (with a mortal sin) we are abusing the Body of Christ and therefore breaking the Covenant with God, the result of which we have seen in the case of Judas (Acts 1:18) when he made the same mistake (John 13:27).

When we continuously abuse the Body of Christ / Eucharist we are in a continuous Covenant with Satan, which is the reason why we have so many problems in life.  Receiving the Body of Christ with a mortal sin is like playing with fire.

A person cannot become guilty of eating and drinking the Body and Blood of Christ unworthily if the bread and wine were not the real Body and Blood of Christ.

During every Mass when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution “this is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant” (Matthew 26:28) we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse (Revelation 16:1-17).\
During every Mass we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement.

1 Corinthians 11:27
Our sacrifice becomes cause of our judgement when it is offered with an unclean heart because we offer a sacrifice for the renewal of a Covenant, not a contract.

When we don’t receive the Body of Christ / Communion in a state of grace or we do not attend the new Covenant Passover celebration (Mass) every Sunday, God is glorified less than He should be and the world is sanctified less than it should be.

It is, therefore, not surprising that sin in the world is increasing, thus giving Satan the power to cause famines, natural disasters, crisis at state / national / global level, problems between family members, terminal illnesses, and suffering & misery in many other forms.

1 Corinthians 12:12–13
*For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.*
We (the body parts of Christ) are united with Christ (the Head) through our Baptism.
One single part of the human body cannot say that *it is a body.*  It can only be *a part* of the human body.  But when all parts are in union with each other then they become *one body.*
Likewise, each individual Christian cannot say that he/she is the Body of Christ.  We become one body only when we are all united in Christ by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace.  If any one of our body parts is separated permanently, it would definitely decay.  Moreover, a separated body part cannot function on its own, without the head, because it will have no life.
Therefore, if we don't live our Christian lives in union with Christ (the Head), then our sinful soul will eventually decay and end up in Hell.

### Day 336 The gifts of the Holy Spirit.

In our modern day and age, we seem to have either suppressed or forgotten the gifts of the Holy Spirit. St Paul urges us not to be unaware of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;
5there are different forms of service but the same Lord;
6there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 1 Cor 12:1-6

There are different gifts but there is only one reason for them, for the service of the Lord. All these gifts are given to us by the same Spirit. These gifts can be used to edify our own spiritual lives and the lives of everyone around us. The gifts are for the building up of the church. The gifts do not make one great or one insignificant, let us remember that it is a gift we did not earn it or deserve it.
To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
9to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
10to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. 1 Cor 12:8-10

The gifts can be listed as:

1. Wisdom
2. Knowledge
3. Faith
4. Healing
5. Mighty deeds(Miracles)
6. Prophecy
7. Discernment of spirits
8. Tongues
9. Interpretation of tongues

The gift of knowledge is to gain supernatural insight into something or someone’s life like people have a vision of something or a strong feeling that the Holy Spirit is speaking to them about something.

The gift of Wisdom is similar to knowledge only difference is it’s usually direction from the Holy Spirit on how to act, it’s more like getting hearing Holy Spirit teach us the will of God or at least a hint about what God wants us to do.
The gift of Faith is not just regular faith that we all have, faith the Jesus is God and the other basic teachings of the church. The gift of Faith is a supernatural gift that we gain such confidence at a certain moment that we know that we are able to pray for God’s supernatural intervention.
People with the gift of healing can lay hands and pray over the sick for natural or supernatural healing.

The gift to work mighty deeds and Miracles are a great sign for the non-believers.
A person with the gift of prophecy is able to listen to the Spirit and speak out God’s words, usually, you will hear the person with this gift say “I sense the Lord saying” followed by the message – it usually is a like a verse from the Bible. The prophecy should always be in alignment with the teaching of Jesus and the church.

The gift of discernment of spirit is a gift that will help us know the where the prophecy is coming from or what spirit is behind a certain action. Like a person who seems to be possessed by the evil may actually only have a medical problem. Anyone with the gift of discernment will be able to discern if it’s because of evil spirit or not.

The gift of tongues is one of the most common gifts, the person with the gift of tongues prays according to the will of the Father in mourns and groans too deep for any human language to explain. But God who looks into the hearts knows the intent.

The gift of tongues is most useful to the congregation when someone has the gift of interpretation of tongues. So that everyone in the congregation will be able to know what the person praying in tongues has just prayed.
Although the gifts of the Spirit may see pretty spectacular, we should not use the gifts as a yardstick for the greatness of the person. Because the gifts are not earned but given, the gifts will cease but one thing will remain. Let us wait till tomorrow to know what is greater than any gift.

Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.
But I shall show you a still more excellent way. 1 Cor 12:31

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Importance of Love

[![The Importance of Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day337.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ekHYubXUoCA "The Importance of Love")

### BIAY Day 337 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 16:3
*Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.*

Paul wanted Timothy to be circumcised because the Jews would not allow an uncircumcised man to enter their territory.  The Jews still strongly believed that every man had to be circumcised, whether he wanted to be a member of the Temple or the Church.  Paul needed Timothy to assist him in his religious work so the only option left was to circumcise Timothy so that they could both enter the Jewish areas and continue their work.

Although the decision had been made during the first council that circumcision was not required to enter the Church, Peter's encyclical had not yet reached all the Churches (v. 4).  It was therefore very important for Paul to visit those areas to settle the disputes between the Jews and the gentiles.

Since circumcision was ordained by God, Timothy was willing to go through it for the sake of the Gospel.

In the process of doing God's work, like Timothy, we must be willing to sacrifice our comfort, if we have to, for the sake of the Gospel, making sure that whatever we do is according to God's Will.

Acts 16:6-10
Everything that Paul was doing for the Church was good work but there's a difference between doing good work and God's work.

Paul had a desire to go to preach in Asia, but God had different plans. God wanted Paul to focus his preaching more in the Greeko-Roman territory because of his knowledge of multiple languages and the culture of the people. Although Paul's intentions were good and he was doing his work for the Lord, he humbled himself and submitted himself to the Lord's desire.

It was at this point that Paul met Luke. Also, the Macedonians were in some kind of trouble and they needed urgent help.

If Paul had gone to Asia against God's Will then maybe he would not have met the evangelist Luke and the Macedonians would not have been saved on time.

Like Paul, sometimes when we have a particular plan laid out to do God’s work, God may inspire our superiors to use our potential in a different way or in a different area that may not have been in our plans. During such time let us humble ourselves and submit ourselves to the Lord's desire, even if we don't like the new mission, rather than fighting with our superiors and being adamant about following only the desire of our heart.  If we forcibly decide to do God's work our own way then the good work which we do is not God's work because it is being done in disobedience to God and therefore contrary to God’s plan.  In the process of doing God's work, like Paul, we must be willing to sacrifice our plans for the sake of the Gospel.  If we allow pride to stand before us, God may give the chance to someone else and not use us at all.

Evangelisation is not about doing God's work the way *we* want it done.
Evangelisation is about doing God's work the way *God* wants it done.
When in doubt, always pray.

Acts 16:25-27
*About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God as the prisoners listened, there was suddenly such a severe earthquake that the foundations of the jail shook; all the doors flew open, and the chains of all were pulled loose.  When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew \[his\] sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.*

Paul and Silas were beaten and thrown in prison but they did not complain or curse their offenders.  Instead, they spent their time in prison praying and singing hymns to God.  Therefore, through their suffering Jesus converted the jailer.
God allowed the earthquake and opened the gates of the prison to move the jailer to ask for salvation.

Acts 16:30-31
*Then the jailer brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”*
*And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you and your household will be saved.”*

The faith of the head of the family was sufficient to baptize the entire non-Christian household because the entire household is expected to obey and respect the head of the family.  Minor children and infants were also included in the baptism because they are under the authority of their parents.  Moreover, children were not allowed to choose a different faith than their parents.

On the other hand, if we are disturbed with the behaviour of any of our family members, God is well aware of what is happening but He will not intervene to bring peace into our homes because He is waiting for us to repent and change ourselves.

If we repent with godly repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10) and lead holy lives, our fallen-away family members can eventually be saved.

God allowed the violent earthquake and whatever happened at the prison on that day because He wanted the jailer and his household to be converted.

The apostles converted the entire households of many Jews and gentiles in the first century AD because one member accepted Jesus and the rest of their families followed in their footsteps.

Therefore,  instead of wasting our time trying to change our difficult spouse, our rebellious children, our nagging in-laws, etc., let us first examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to the Lord in all we do and say.  And let us be thankful to God in every situation, positive or negative, even though we cannot see any good in the negatives.

1 Corinthians 13:1-3
*If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.*
*And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body to be burnt so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.*

Speaking in tongues, prophetic powers, faith in Christ, knowledge of scriptures, donating all our possessions, martyrdom, etc., are all good, but if we hate or dislike even one human, living or dead, then we are not in a state of grace and everything else we do is in vain.

The new law is a law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love, written on our hearts, and must be put into practice.  It is not meant just to be kept in our memories or on our tongues.

If we cannot love everyone 100 percent and if we cannot help those in need then we have disobeyed the new Commandment and our worship is all false.

True faith in God combined with true love of neighbor produces good works of mercy just as a good tree produces good fruits (Matthew 21:18-22).

### Day 337 Love never fails

The gifts of the Holy Spirit are not sanctifying gifts, they are for the common good of the Church. Of course, they can aid in our sanctification if we cooperate with God’s will. But the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not the yardstick, the fruits of the Holy Spirit are what we should look for.
If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.
2And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. 1 Cor 13:1-2

So if someone has all the gifts and no fruits they are a noisy cymbal. All the gifts of the Holy Spirit should operate out of love. Love in our modern-day standards is stripped of its true meaning. The true meaning of love is stated in Corinthians.
Love is patient,
Love is kind.
Love is not jealous,
Love is not pompous, it is not inflated,
Love is not rude,
Love does not seek its own interests
Love is not quick-tempered
Love does not brood over injury,
Love does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. 1 Cor 13:4-8

The best way to judge a person is not with the gifts but by the fruits. We should see if the person is patient, kind, not proud, not jealous, not rude or quick-tempered, does not brood over injury or hold a record of wrongs. The person can bear all things, believe and hope for all things and endures all things.
We need to grow and develop the fruits of the Spirit, cooperate with God’s grace and develop fruit. That is why St Paul said that Love will never fail, everything else will be pass away.

If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.
9For we know partially and we prophesy partially,
10but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love. 1 Cor 13:8-10, 13.

So let us strive for the gifts of the Holy Spirit, so we can serve the church and also edify our spiritual lives. But our focus should be on our relationship with the Lord. We should grow in the fruits of the Holy Spirit because only the fruit last the gifts will cease.

Let us grow in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Gal 5:22,23

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Death Defeated

[![Death Defeated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day338.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hOyFIABD9IY "Death Defeated")

### Day 338 O death where your is your sting

All the advancement in science and technology has not allowed anyone to live forever. Death can be extended but never overcome.
None of the gods in this world can say they have overcome death or are able to rise again from the dead. Thanks be to God Jesus died and rose again, He now gives us eternal life.

“Death is swallowed up in victory.
55Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?”
56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
57But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Cor 15: 54-57

We have nothing to fear as the worst thing that can happen to anyone death, has been conquered by Jesus Christ. We have victory through Christ, we have life eternal, after we died we live forever. We just transition from earthly life to eternal heavenly life.

Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
52in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53For that which is corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility, and that which is mortal must clothe itself with immortality. 1 Cor 15:51-53

On our own we are not holy enough to enter into God’s presence, we are mortal and corrupt. But when we put on Christ, the immortal and incorruptibility we are made perfect and holy so we can enter into the presence of God.
Some of us have a lifetime to prepare and some will not, so we are to always be ready for the Lord. The seasons of the church, Advent and Lent are perfect times to reset and reevaluate our lives. Everything corrupt needs to be clothed with Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Priscilla and Aquila

### Day 339 Living as a loving community

Many people stay away from church because of a bad experience with other folks at church. People are hurt intentionally or unintentionally, and people feel excluded or unworthy. Let us try to overcome all of these and come together as a loving community for Christ.

Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
Your every act should be done with love.
I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they made up for your absence,
18for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such people.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Cor 20: 13,14,17,18,20

St Paul encourages us to be on our guard and to stand firm in our faith, to be courageous and strong, and do everything out of love. We have to be strong both inside and outside the church, we should stand firm when someone tries to push us around, our faith should overcome any fear or overpower any negativity. We should do everything out of love, remember love is patient, kind, enduring, does not hold grudges, not proud or rude. We are called to be a good example in the church, and exhibit love where there seems to be a lack of love.

We should also love the Lord above everything else.
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Marana tha. 1 Cor 12:3

St Paul seems to be coming off to strong here when we said if anyone does not love the Lord let him be accursed. But a deeper understanding of the word can help.

Accursed: literally, “anathema.” This expression (cf. 1 Cor 12:3) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in preparation for the Lord’s coming and judgment

During the season of Advent don’t we pray Maranatha?

Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the early Christian liturgy. As understood here (“O Lord, come!”), it is a prayer for the early return of Christ.
Come Lord Jesus Come.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Power of the Holy Spirit

[![The Power of the Holy Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day340.jpg)](https://youtu.be/S66B7h4dObE "The Power of the Holy Spirit")

### Day 340 A true Christian life should have a personal relationship with Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit.

Many people complain that faith and religion are boring and that they get nothing out of church. Sunday Mass becomes another weekend chore like grocery shopping. We may be missing one of these two important parts of our faith.
We see how the evil spirit tossed up the sons of Sceva, because they did not have a personal relationship with Jesus.

Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”
14When the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, tried to do this,
15the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I recognize, Paul I know, but who are you?”
16The person with the evil spirit then sprang at them and subdued them all. He so overpowered them that they fled naked and wounded from that house.
We cannot live our faith lives with textbook knowledge of Jesus, we need to have a loving and living relationship with Jesus. We cannot just claim to know “about” Jesus but need know him.

“You are one with Jesus as the body is one with the head. You must then have one breath with him, one soul, one life, one will, one mind, one heart, and he must be your breath, heart, love, life, your all.”—Saint John Eudes

The second thing missing in our life may be a relationship with the Holy Spirit. We may be like the Christians in Ephesus who had no clue who the Holy Spirit us.
When I was younger I though the Holy Spirit was just a nice dove that flew around and descended on Jesus at His Baptism. Some people think of the Holy Spirit as a symbol of fire, dove or wind.

He said to them, “Did you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?” They answered him, “We have never even heard that there is a holy Spirit.”
3He said, “How were you baptized?” They replied, “With the baptism of John.”
4Paul then said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”
5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6And when Paul laid \[his\] hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.Ep 19:2-6

The Holy Spirit is no simple dove, but the very life support of our souls. The Holy Spirit is our advocate, counselor, helper, teacher, guide and the very help that Jesus promised us. Jesus said it was better that He went away so that the Holy Spirit can be sent. The Holy Spirit gave the fearful disciples courage to come out of hiding and preach the good news – without fearing even death.
Let us spend time to speak with Jesus each day and listen to His words, be led by the Holy Spirit and live a love and joy filled life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 340 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 19:5-6
*When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.*
*And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.*

The believers received two Sacraments.
The believers entered the Church with faith.  They were then baptized with water (v.5) (Sacrament of Baptism) to wash away all past sins (for adults), including the curse of original sin (for all), and make them worthy of being part of God’s family, thus enabling them to receive sanctifying graces and take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion).  Thereafter Paul (the Apostle/Bishop) confirmed them by laying his hands upon them (v.6) to receive the Holy Spirit (Sacrament of Confirmation).
When we receive the first Sacrament (water baptism) the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Jesus (1 Corinthians 12:13) but when we receive the second Sacrament (Confirmation) Jesus baptizes us with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 2:4).
Through Baptism we receive the life of the Trinity and through Confirmation we receive the mission of the Trinity.

Acts 19:11-12
*So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God accomplished at the hands of Paul that when face cloths or aprons that touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.*
God heals people even through material things or through dead bodies just as God heals our bodies through the doctors, and heals our souls through the priests; and just as God sanctifies us through water (baptism), and anoints us through oil, etc.
When the dead body of a Moabite touched Elisha’s dead body the Moabite became alive (2 Kings 13:20-21).
People were healed when they touched the fringe of the garment of Jesus (Mathew 14:35-36; Mark 5:28-29).
God uses people and material things to heal people because He wants us to remain in communication with each other to build a family relation.

Acts 19:13-16
*Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”  Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.  But the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.*
Exorcism in the name of Jesus cannot be performed without faith in Jesus.
Exorcism performed without the name of Jesus would be demonic.
Exorcism performed without being in a state of grace can be dangerous for the exorcist.

The authority to exorcise demons was given by Jesus only to the 12 apostles. He didn't give the authority to His other disciples.
Exorcising demons is not something that anyone can do. To be a successful exorcist it is very important that a man has to be an ordained priest living in a state of grace otherwise it can prove to be disastrous or even fatal for him.

### Eternal Weight of Glory

[![Eternal Weight of Glory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day341.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_JwmReST630 "Eternal Weight of Glory")

### Day 341 We walk by faith, not by sight.

The Christian life is a life of dependence on God, we may not know God’s plan for us but we trust Him fully. We do not go by what we see but walk by faith, knowing that the God who created us will take care of us. We may feel abandoned or alone on this journey especially when we are going through the trials of life. Let us rest assured that Jesus is walking with us and is carrying us.

“We walk by faith, not by sight.” 2corinthians 5:5
We will face many challenges in life, we may feel as though we are crushed but we will rise again in the strength of the Lord.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;
2 Cor 4:8-9

Although we may seem persecuted, afflicted and struck down, we should have faith and we God will make a way out for us. We will never be constrained or driven to despair or destroyed. We will rise up with wings as eagles and our strength will be renewed. The Lord Himself will hold our hands and lift us up. When we are weak He is strong.
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.

11For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 2 Cor 4:10-11

When we suffer, we suffer with Christ, He is the head and we are the body. But our suffering will bring new life in heaven. Our suffering takes on a new meaning when we unite our suffering with Christ's suffering for the salvation of the world.
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence. 2 Cor 4: 14

Our suffering will not be in vain the Holy Spirit will raise us up into the presence of Jesus.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Generous Hearts

[![Generous Hearts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day342.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pM7Yv6QskfI "Generous Hearts")

### Day 342 The real struggles of being a disciple of Christ.

When we read about the great miracles performed by the early disciples we can assume that they were able to do anything. But the disciples had real problems and suffering. They needed to be strong and endure the hardships that came their way.

We cause no one to stumble in anything, in order that no fault may be found with our ministry;
4 on the contrary, in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships, constraints,
5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts;
6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
7in truthful speech, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
8through glory and dishonor, insult and praise. We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
9as unrecognized and yet acknowledged; as dying and behold we live; as chastised and yet not put to death;
10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things. 2 Cor 6:3-10

The disciples had to endure so many hardships as listed above, that they were beaten and not respected. They were proclaiming the truth but were considered deceivers. They were chastised and put to death because they decided to preach Christ.
In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the church of their many sins. He prayed and hoped that they would change their lives for the Lord.
For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it; and if I did regret it (\[for\] I see that that letter saddened you, if only for a while),
9I rejoice now, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened into repentance; for you were saddened in a godly way, so that you did not suffer loss in anything because of us.

10For godly sorrow produces a salutary repentance without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death. 2 Cor 7:8-10

Paul’s suffering and struggle did not go in vain, his first letter bore good fruit. The church in Corinth repented and there is great rejoining in heaven when anyone repents.
Sometimes as parents or leaders, we should not hesitate to correct those in our care. We are responsible for their spiritual lives, we should tell people that they are wrong when needed.
Let us pray for all teachings, leaders, priests, parents, elders, or anyone in authority.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 342 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 21:13
*Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”*

The man who once took the life of a Christian because of his faith (Acts 7:58) was now ready to give his own life for the same faith.  One act of mercy from Stephen changed the life of Paul forever and brought thousands into the Church.
Paul's conversion should give us hope that if we forgive our persecutors and pray for them, it is possible that they will repent and accept Christ some day.\
However sinful a person may be, God can convert anyone anytime and use them for His glory.

Therefore, while we make sure to pray for our brothers and sisters who are victims of persecution, let us not forget to pray for the conversion of the persecutors.

2 Corinthians 6:2
*For he says: “In an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.”  Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.*
For us, the day of salvation is not what happened 2000 years ago.  For us, the day of salvation is "today" because we are members of the Body of Christ.
We ask the Lord to give us our new Manna "today" (Matthew 6:11) so that we can consume it “today” because if we keep it for the next day it will rot (Exodus 16:19-20).\
We are building bridges, not walls.

2 Corinthians 6:16–18
*We are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  Therefore, come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters.”*

This promise was made to the Israelites (Leviticus 26:11-12; Ezekiel 20:41) but now it is only for the Christians (Jewish and non-Jewish).

When we receive the Body of Christ (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) we receive divine life and thus we become temples of the living God because God will live in us until we commit a mortal sin.

2 Corinthians 7:10
*For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.*
True godly sorrow is sorrow over having wounded and broken God’s heart with our sins.  The Holy Spirit will bring out that sorrow.  We cannot truly repent without the Holy Spirit convicting us of our sin.

Trying to appear repentant and sorrowful to escape the consequences of our wrong doings in this world, after being caught, is not true repentance.\
Repenting and confessing sins without the feeling of guilt, just to keep out of Hell, is also not true repentance.\
Those are all types of worldly sorrow.

When we realize just how much God loves us, and when we feel the pain that Jesus felt during His passion for our sins, the Holy Spirit will make that awareness come to us and cause us to grieve. It is more like a rebellious young man in a prison cell reflecting on how he hurt and disgraced his parents and siblings by committing a crime; that is godly sorrow.  It is the sorrow that comes from our heart.

2 Corinthians 8:9
*For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.*
Jesus was rich when He was divine but He became a poor human so that by receiving Him into our bodies in a state of grace we can share in His divine nature.  In other words, Jesus in His generosity gave up His divinity to make us spiritually rich.\
Likewise, in imitation of Christ, we too must give up all our earthly comfort and luxury and lead simple lives so that we can give our excess to the poor to help raise them up to our level (Acts 4:34-35).

Thus we can gradually erase poverty with our generosity.

### Day 343 Boast in our weakness

St Paul went through many trails and hardships as he persistently preached Jesus.
I am still more, with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, far worse beatings, and numerous brushes with death.

24Five times at the hands of the Jews I received forty lashes minus one.
25Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I passed a night and a day on the deep;
26on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own race, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers;
27in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights, through hunger and thirst, through frequent fastings, through cold and exposure.
28And apart from these things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 1 Cor 11:23-28

St Paul was beaten, stoned, shipwrecked, exposed to the dangers of elements, robbers, wilderness, sea, fasting, hunger and most hard of all daily pressure and anxiety for all the churches. Instead of running away from suffering, Paul decided to boast in them, boast in his weakness.
“If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness” 2 Cor 11:30.

As a spiritual exercise let us try to reflect on two things.

1. What suffering am I willing to go through for the sake of the Kingdom?
2. What do I boast in, my strengths or my weaknesses.

In our weakness, we are strong, because God's power is made perfect in out weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 343 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 22:30
God could have definitely freed Paul but it was not His Will at that moment because it would not accomplish God's salvation plan.

If we are going through some problem or sickness or suffering, there is no harm in asking God to free us from the problem or sickness or suffering but until the solution comes we must continue focusing on God's Will because that may have been God's way of leading us on His path.

2 Corinthians 9:7
*Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.*
The sheep received their heavenly reward because they were charitable and the goats were condemned.
Paul was teaching the people how important it was to be charitable.

2 Corinthians 10:12
*We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they do not show good sense.*
False prophets equal themselves to eloquent speakers to prove that they are the true prophets.

2 Corinthians 11:4
*For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.*
The false prophets may have been teaching one or more of the below heresies which had already started spreading during the first century AD:

1. Jesus was not God
2. Jesus was not man,
3. Jesus wasn't crucified,
4. Jesus didn't rise from the dead.
   Paul gave the people a choice.  They could either embrace the truth, even if the preacher was not a good speaker, or they could accept an impressive preacher who tickled their ears with lies.

### The Thorn in Paul's Side

[![The Thorn in Paul's Side](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day344.jpg)](https://youtu.be/GZadAsEqM8o "The Thorn in Paul's Side")

### Day 344 My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.

St Paul received great revelation from God, he did not meet the other disciples or learn much from them, we all remember Jesus appeared to him during his conversion when he was struck down from the horse. It seems he was receiving all this doctrine supernaturally.

Therefore, that I might not become too elated, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.

Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me,
9 but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.
10Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Cor 12:8-10

St Paul was given a thorn in his flesh, we can only speculate if it was a sin, sickness or disability. Or probably the inability to speak well in public or his poor eyesight. Whatever it was it really troubled him, Paul begged God to take it away 3 times, here 3 times is not literally 3 times it must have been more than three. 3 is a complete number symbolizing the trinity – so St Paul really prayed through and prayed completely for this thorn to be removed.

God did not answer him positively but gave him a better solution. The solution was God himself, it was not by our holiness but by God’s power that our weakness is made strong. We are made perfect in Christ. God’s grace is sufficient for us, whatever is lacking in us is filled by God’s love.
God was saving Paul from the greatest sin of all, the sin of Pride. That is why the thorn was permitted in Paul’s life.

So when you struggle with habitual sin or a chronic condition and wonder why God does not deliver you from it, maybe it’s God’s way of keeping us close to Him. Whenever you find yourself lacking or weak run to Jesus in the sacrament of Reconciliation and the Eucharist. God’s grace is sufficient for us, power is made perfect in weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 344 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 23:6-11
Paul was aware of the mixed crowd in front of him and therefore used his wisdom to create a situation which would force the Sanhedrin to transfer him to Rome, where he wanted to take the Gospel because Rome was the center of the world during those days. He distracted them with his statement and pitted them against each other, causing an uproar in the House so that he would be removed from the trial.

2 Corinthians 12:7-10
*Therefore, that I might not become too elated because of the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.   Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me, but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.”  I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.   Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.*

The thorn in the flesh may have been an adversary of Paul who was making his life miserable, or it may have been a wound that hurt him real bad, like a throbbing pain, so he begged the Lord to take away his suffering.

Like Jesus in the garden of Gethsemene, three times Paul begged Jesus to spare him of the suffering but the answer was "no," therefore Paul accepted the suffering as God's Will.  The healing was withheld for a higher purpose.

When God chooses people for His mission, He will break them with sufferings (sickness, insults, humiliation, rejection, problems, etc.) so that when people see the positive results inspite of the suffering they will believe that it is because of the power of God working in those chosen people and not because of their expertise.  The suffering is also meant to humble the chosen ones so that they may not boast about their achievements.

When Paul spoke of his credentials he did not refer to the degrees or certificates which he had acquired from learning under the guidance of the famous Rabbi.  Rather he spoke of his sufferings (2 Corinthians 11:23-28) because, by being patient and resigned during his sufferings for the sake of Christ he had allowed Christ to suffer through him and thus made Christ victorious in bringing salvation to others.

Paul clearly understood his mission as a follower of Christ and was faithful to his mission.
If we have not understood our mission as Christians then let us ask the Lord to help us understand His Will for us.

2 Corinthians 12:12
*The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, signs and wonders and mighty works.*
The proof of a prophet or apostle chosen by God is seen in the miracles which the prophet or apostle  works.

Many people try to justify not going to Church by saying – “I’m a good person”. They are trying to justify themselves by following the law, not the Jewish law but their own law. People make up their own rules or follow the moral rules of natural law and think they will get to heaven. Heaven is described as a place where God is present and if people don’t want to have anything to do with God on earth then there is no point in going to heaven to be with God forever.

who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.Gal 2:16

We are not saved by works, so just doing good works will not get us to heaven. If we could be saved by being a good person then there was no need for Jesus to die for us.
If we are satisfied by just being a good person we fall into the trap of being perfect and not needing a savior, because we have already achieved what is good.
We are to have faith in Christ, we need to die to ourselves and live in Christ.

For through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;
20yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.
21I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.Gal 2: 19-21

Living a life united with Christ on earth will get us to heaven. When goodness itself lives in our heart, we radiate the love of Christ to this dark world.
It is no longer about me, it’s about Christ present in my heart. My hands are not mine anymore but Christ’s hands which love the poor and weak. My feet are not mine but Christ’s which are feet that bring good news to the world.
I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

Galatians 1:6-12
The false Gospel which Paul was referring to was the teaching which some people were spreading among the gentiles that accepting the Gospel and being baptized was fine, but if they truly wanted to be saved then, in addition, it was also necessary that they must be circumcised and they must follow the Mosaic Law.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

We must follow the Gospel which the Apostles have given us, not a Gospel that teaches us different, or a Gospel that has been modified.  In other words, if we depart from the Liturgy of the Church, we depart from Christ.

Galatians 2:10
Peter, James and John emphasized to Paul that he must always remember the poor.
From the time the law was first given to God’s people, God had emphasized that they must always take care of the poor (Deut. 15:11).  Jesus also reminded us of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).
Therefore, reading the Bible every day, praying for long hours, attending worship, etc. are all of no use if we have neglected the poor people around us.

Galatians 2:11-14
Peter was not giving any erroneous doctrinal teaching.  Paul opposed him because Peter was not practicing what he was preaching.
Spiritual leaders are sinners like us and are therefore likely to commit sins like us. Peter was trying to save his skin and therefore ended up going against his own teaching. In such cases they must be open to correction from their subordinates.

Galatians 2:16
*We, who are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles, yet who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.*

Paul was clearing the confusion among the Jews who had been baptized, that they had not received their hope for salvation because they were obedient to the Law of Moses, but that the gates of heaven had been opened for them because of God's grace.

We are not justified by works of the Mosaic Law or works that are not done for Christ.  The Mosaic Law was given to the people to discipline them and to live holy lives.  The Mosaic Law was not good enough to purify a person’s conscience/soul to receive salvation.   Therefore, after the resurrection, we now follow the Law of Christ, not the Law of Moses.

The early Church still being in its infancy, it was normal for the Jewish Christians to face such confusion because they were previously expected to strictly follow the Mosaic Law or else they would be cut out from God’s family.

Galatians 2:20
*Yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.*

Christ lives in us from the time we are baptized, and continues to live in us as long as we are in a state of grace and surrender our will to His Will.

Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was the first Christian in whom Christ lived physically, and the life which she lived in the flesh she lived by faith in the Son of God, her Son, who loved her and gave Himself up for her, as much as He gave Himself up for us.

Let us follow her example and live by true faith in Christ and for Christ so that Christ can live in us always.

Galatians 3:1-14
Paul was not speaking about good works of mercy, or against it.  According to the Jews "works of the Law" meant "strictly observing all the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law," example: ritual washing, circumcision, Sabbath, kosher diet, etc. Paul was explaining to the Galatians that by observing those ceremonies they would never be able to save their souls because those were only shadows of the reality of the Christian faith. They can be saved by faith in Jesus and by obeying all the commandments.

### Fruits of the Spirit

[![Fruits of the Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day346.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ai-TYQfqfJo "Fruits of the Spirit")

### Day 346 The Fruit of the Spirit

Just as a tree is known by its fruit, a disciple of Jesus is known by their fruits.

In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.Gal 5:22-23

We could spend hours going over each of these fruits and we should ponder on each of these each day. We can use the fruits of the Spirit to examine our conscience every night, check if we loved enough, had joy in our trials, keep the peace, were kind to strangers, generous to those in need, faithful to God, family and friends, did we have self-control on our senses? I’m sure we all will feel that we are lacking in some area or the other.
So how do we grow more fruit? The answer is simple we need to nourish the tree. We nourish ourselves with the Sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist, we prune dead branches at the sacrament of reconciliation. The trees need the sun to live so do we, we need the “Son” to live. Personal prayer and Bible reading are a critical part of our nourishment as well. Also trees stay together in a forest so they can withstand gusty winds and other elements, we likewise need the love of a community to grown and be strong.
Most important thing for a tree is water, we need the living waters – the Holy Spirit to thrive.

For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want. But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Gal 5:17-18

If we want to bear fruit we need to be guided by the Holy Spirit, we just cannot do what the flesh desires. The desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit. The works of the flesh can drag us down and stunt our growth.

Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,
20idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,
21occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Gal 5:19-21

Let us steer clear of the above traps of the flesh and be led by the Holy Spirit. If we can focus on leading a holy life, a life led and guided by the Holy Spirit the fruit of the Spirit will automatically grow and people will take joy in our presence. People will be drawn to us when they see the love, joy, peace, patience…..

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 347 Promises & Blessings from Ephesians 1

Sometime the best thing to do is read and ponder on the Bible. Let us do just that as we read the promises and blessings from Ephesians 1.

4 God choose us in Christ before the creation of the world

5 From Eternity he destined us in love to be his adopted sons and daughters in Christ

7 in Christ we obtain freedom, sealed by His blood
have forgiveness of sins greatness of his grace he lavishes on us

14 We were sealed by the Holy Spirit

17 May God reveal himself to you & give you a spirit of wisdom & revelation

18 May he enlighten your inner vision
May we know how great the inheritance, the glory, God sets apart for us

19 May we understand with what extraordinary power he acts in favor of us who believe

20 Jesus Christ is above all rule, power, authority, dominion or any supernatural force that could be named

22 God put all things under his feet, Christ is the head we are the body.

Let us Pray: Lord Jesus, reveal your self to me and may I experience the greatness of your grace. Thank you for working in my favor with extraordinary power. I submit my life at your feet Lord, lead me Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 347 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 26:14
*"It hurts you to kick against the goads (spikes)."*

This is a Greek proverb about useless and harmful resistance, well understood by the farmers. Stubborn yoked oxen that kick against the plowman will only hurt themselves on the goads (sharp spikes) behind them.

Jesus had told Paul that Paul’s resistance to the Gospel was futile to the point of being personally harmed.

This is true, not only for Paul, but for every human, Christian and non-Christian.
It is possible that a Christian can reject the Gospel some time after he is baptized, if he desires to follow another faith, either because he is threatened or offered some benefits or for any other reason.

Acts 26:32
*And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”*

Paul appealed to the emperor (Caesar), not because he wanted to be set free but because he had a strong desire to preach the Gospel to Caesar (Acts 28:xxxxx).\
Do we have that kind of passion to spread the Gospel even when times are bad for us?

### Rules for the New Life

[![Rules for the New Life](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day348.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DXRlsHSDHRo "Rules for the New Life")

### Day 348 Put on the armor of God

To live as a true Christian means to live in a war zone on earth. The world around us is not a perfect place to live in, there are many distractions, temptations, anxieties, and opposition. The world values are opposed to the Kingdom's values and principles. We sometimes overlook the fact that the devil and his fallen angels are constantly at war against us trying to rob, steal, and destroy our souls.
For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens Ep 6:12

We need to draw strength from the Lord who is all-powerful and the enemy stands defeated in His Mighty and Matchless name, the name of Jesus.
Finally, draw your strength from the Lord and from his mighty power. Ep 6:10

We need to guard ourselves against the contact attack we are under, the way to do that is to put on the whole armor of God. In fact, it is stated twice to put on the armor of God. When things are important they are mentioned twice. Just like Jesus said “truly truly I say to you”
Put on the armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the tactics of the devil. Ep 6:11

Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your ground. Ep 6:13
The armor of God is compared to a soldier’s armor, because we are in the battlefield.
So stand fast with your loins girded in truth, clothed with righteousness as a breastplate,
15and your feet shod in readiness for the gospel of peace.
16In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all \[the\] flaming arrows of the evil one.
17And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Ep 6:14-17

· Belt of Truth
· Breastplate of righteousness
· Shoes of Peace
· Shield of Faith
· Helmet of Salvation
· Sword of the Spirit – the word of God

BELT OF TRUTH
As a Christian we know that the truth sets us free, so we always have to secure our lives in the truth. Just as the belt holds our cloths secure and prevents us from disgrace, so does truth. My mom always said – “if you tell one lie, you will need to tell 10 more lies to cover that up.” We have to hold firm to the truth of the Gospel and the truth about ourselves.

BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
None our us can claim to be righteous except through the righteousness we receive from Christ. We should always stay in a state of grace, going to confession if we have any mortal sin on our hearts. Going to regular Mass helps wash away the venial sins.

SHOES OF PEACE
Blessed are the feet that bring good news to the world. We are called to be peacemakers and ones who will bring people together. We are called to go out to the ends of the earth to proclaim God’s word. Wearing shoes means ready and willing to go out as the Holy Spirit leads.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!” Is 52:7

SHIELD OF FAITH
In all circumstances we should hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. The evil one will shoot arrows of doubt, negativity, lies, confusion, envy, jealously, anger… we are to hold up the shield of Faith, knowing that God will take care of us. Holding up the shield of faith means knowing that God is on our side and no weapon formed against us will prosper.

HELMET OF SALVATION
Knowing that Jesus has saved us from death and that He will give us eternal life should always be on our minds. If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or depression, guard your mind with the Helmet of Salvation.
SWORD OF THE SPIRIT – THE WORD OF GOD
Imagine a soldier in a battle without his sword. The enemy will keep on attacking until the armor is broken. That is the case with many Christians today, they do not know the word of God. “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” So rightly said in Hosea we are unable to stand up against the devil because we do not know the Word of God. Remember Jesus in the desert fought off the devil with the Word of God. The Sword is the only offensive weapon we have, and so is the Word of God, it is sharper than any two-edged sword. If you want to live a victorious life, read scripture and memorize it. The Holy Spirit will bring to you the right scripture in battle.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 348 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 27:17
*They hoisted it aboard, then used cables to undergird the ship. Because of their fear that they would run aground on the shoal of Syrtis, they lowered the drift anchor and were carried along in this way.*

The sailors were afraid of being driven across to the quicksands of the African coast, so they lowered the topsails and were thus driven before the wind.
The ship that Paul was sailing on encountered a huge storm with hurricane force winds. For fourteen days they didn’t see the sun or the stars. The sailors tried their best to steer the ship, did everything they could to keep control, but the winds were too strong. Therefore, instead of fighting it and trying to force where they wanted the ship to go, they took down the sails and let the wind drive them.

Are we trying to control everything and getting upset because it’s not happening according to our way?  Are we trying to force things to happen our way?

When we have done everything we can —we have prayed, we have believed, we have stood in faith—there comes a time when we have to do like the sailors did:  Quit fighting it, quit trying to force it to work out, quit losing sleep, and release control of it into God’s hands. Then rest in faith and trust Him.  God will take the same winds that were meant to stop us and shift them to blow us forward according to His plan.

Acts 27:33-38
After breaking bread (“artos” in Greek) (v. 27:35), Paul did not distribute it as is the normal procedure.  Paul celebrated the new Passover (Mass) and consumed the Body of Christ (Holy Eucharist) himself, while the other people in the boat ate normal food (“trapheh” in Greek) (v. 27:34 & 36), probably because they were not baptized people.

Ephesians 4:7 and 11-13
*But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift.  The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.*

The duty of the people in authority in the Church is not only to spread the Gospel but also to train their subordinates to spread the Gospel. And the role of the subordinates in the Church is not a passive role of just listening to the Word of God, but, along with the people in authority, the subordinates must also play an active role in the Church by assisting in spreading the Gospel.

Ephesians 4:26
*Be angry but don't sin.*

When we are offended by others or when we see the wicked ones harming the innocent ones, it is understandable that such behavior makes us angry. But, in our anger, when we go one step further to retaliate, then we are no different than those sinners.

Creating a negative situation is the devil's way of dragging the good ones on his path.
God allows that to happen as a test for us and also so that we can bring those negative people close to Him with our patience, prayers and forgiveness.
When we face such situations let us remember that when Jesus was attacked physically and verbally, He did not retaliate.  Instead, He patiently bore the pain of the extreme torture and forgave them.

Ephesians 5:1-20
If a man uses his neighbors or friends to help him daily with his work, he will pay them at the end of the day or the month and send them home, but he will not give a share of his inheritance for his neighbors or friends.  His inheritance will always be for his obedient children, not even for his rebellious ones.  The rebellious ones may end up in prison for life.

Similarly, since God is a Holy Father, He may use many people to do His kingdom work on earth but His inheritance will only be for His obedient children.  The rebellious ones may end up in prison (Hell) for life.

Paul therefore warns us to beware of unholy life.  We must avoid sinful thoughts, sinful words and sinful deeds.  God’s children belong to Heaven and must therefore not allow anger, hatred, revenge, greed, selfishness, lies, disobedience, etc., etc. to enter their hearts (Ephesians 4:31-32).  Alcohol must be consumed within limits so that they don’t get drunk or else the evil spirit will start controlling them.  We must lead holy lives so that we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us always (v.18).

We are called to be like God by practicing our virtues.  We must therefore be kind, loving, generous, forgiving, etc.

Ephesians 5:1
*Be imitators of God, as beloved children.*

Paul was not asking us to divinize ourselves.

We have been created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), therefore we have the ability to be loving, forgiving, generous, kind, patient, understanding, etc. and we can imitate God by practicing these virtues.  This means that we must always remain in a Covenant relation with God, not with Satan.  We can go a long way by doing little acts of love and forgiveness, little acts of generosity and kindness, etc. both in and out of our homes.

God is love, and those who live in love live in God, and God lives in them (1 John 4:16).  God's Covenant love is free, faithful, total and fruitful.

If we say that we have surrendered ourselves to Christ, then we must love everyone around us unconditionally like Christ, and we must also be ready to suffer like Christ, because there is no true love without suffering.

Ephesians 5:3-7
When our faith is weak, we must not associate ourselves with people who take us away from God.  Instead, we must strengthen our faith and do our best to bring others closer to God by the way we live, speak and interact with others.
Idolatry is not just about worshipping statues of creation. Idolatry is also about spending more time with creation than required and less time with God.\
Example:  working extra hours, spending too much time with social media, entertainment (movies, TV shows, sports, etc.), etc.

Ephesians 5:8-14
Paul was addressing the Ephesians who were pagans before they came into the Church. They were probably not aware of what was good and what was bad because in paganism it was normal to accept certain practices which were abhorrent to God, such as abuse of women and children, idolatry, immorality, etc.
Christians must therefore, not only avoid doing those evils but they must also avoid speaking about them.

Ephesians 5:14-16
*Awake, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

Paul wants us to wake up from the sinful world, stay away from it and try to do everything that pleases God.  We do not know when our time on earth will end therefore we must spend our earthly life in making wise decisions that will help us to come closer to God by the way we live and by the way we act.

Ephesians 5:15-16
*Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

We must use our time to do God's Will and try to accomplish God's mission, as if we are going to die tomorrow. We must try to do whatever is possible when we are alive. We must not use our time to get involved with worldly things.

Ephesians 5:18-20
*Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.*

God gave the Israelites a land which was rich in grapes (Numbers 13:23), because wine was to be used in the daily offerings during the Liturgical services, in the old Covenant (Exodus 29:38-42) as well as in the new Covenant (Matthew 26:27; Revelation 6:6).

Therefore Paul does not say "don't drink wine"; He warns us not to get drunk because excess of anything, other than God, is a sin and the beginning of disaster.  Drinking wine is not a sin but if we don’t have self-control then it is better not to touch wine.

The Ephesians may have had a serious addiction to wine because Paul doesn't speak so strongly to the other Churches about getting drunk.  However, Paul's instructions are valid even today. When we consume wine beyond limit it causes evil words to flow out of our mouths, and thus we separate ourselves from God (Proverbs 23:31-35).  Instead, Paul wants us to use our tongues to worship God by singing Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, etc. and engage ourselves with activities that bring us closer to God.

Ephesians 5:21-33
The first level of humility is obedience.  The next level is service.
A baptized man is a symbol of Christ (the new Adam) and a baptized woman is a symbol of the Church (the new Eve) (Ephesians 5:23-24).
When a man does not obey God's commandments then he must not have any expectations from his wife because when the head of the family is in a Covenant with Satan then the whole family struggles spiritually.

Marriage with conditions is a contract, not a Covenant and is not from God.\
In marriage there is no return policy.
Man and wife must love and serve each other to bring out the best person in the spouse, and not to highlight their spouse’s weaknesses (Ephesians 5:21).  We must allow God to use our spouses to correct us whenever we are wrong.  Both man and wife must find ways to serve each other, and not expect to be served.

As the head of the family, a man's mission is to die to himself every day in order to make his wife holy.  Whatever he does he must do for his wife and not for himself.  The intention is to ensure that with their love and care for each other, no sin enters their home and their lives, so that they will both receive eternal life.

The Holy Family is a great example for us. Jesus was the Son of God the Father and Mary was the Mother of God the Son. Joseph was the only ordinary human and the least among the three. But Jesus and Mary did not rule over Joseph. They subjected themselves to Joseph in obedience to his every decision.

Ephesians 6:10-20
In Ephesians 5 Paul just finished giving us advice on how to live a holy family life, by loving each other with sacrificial love; love between man and wife, between parents and children, between masters and slaves.
But in Ephesians 6 Paul starts speaking of spiritual warfare.
The greatest battle field we have to stand on in life is the battle field of our own homes.  Jesus commanded us to carry our crosses faithfully every day (Luke 9:23) but the most difficult crosses which we have to carry may be in our own homes.   We may, therefore, sometimes find it more easier to practice our Christian faith faithfully outside our homes rather than inside.
Marriage was God's plan for bringing forth new life therefore family is what Satan hates because he is the author of death.

Therefore, if we have a difficult or unfaithful spouse, rebellious children, nagging in-laws, etc. let us remember that it is not our family members that are bad but it is Satan using our family members to force us to eat the forbidden fruit through quarrels, misunderstanding, accusations, blaming each other, etc. to drag us into his kingdom along with our families.\
Let us, therefore, ensure that we forgive each other as God forgives us, not with sarcastic apologies, but with genuine apologies from the heart.
It is not wrong to put on the full armour of God when we are outside our homes, but God wants us to put on His full armour first in our own homes.\
Spiritually healthy families together make a healthy Church.

### Holy Indifference

[![Holy Indifference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day349.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lreKo78BWI "Holy Indifference")

### Day 349 Work out your salvation

We are called to work out our salvation, as opposed to a passive I’ll do nothing but God will save me. Being a Christian means striving to be holy and do good works of mercy. Although our holiness will never be enough because of our fallen nature and the corrupt world we live in, God in His Mercy and Grace will purify us and welcome us into heaven.
So then, my beloved, obedient as you have always been, not only when I am present but all the more now when I am absent, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
13For God is the one who, for his good purpose, works in you both to desire and to work. Ph 2:12-13

God is on our side and God works in us with both desire(faith) and works. We need not fear for our God is the almighty one, everything on earth bows down to our God.
Rather, he emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.
9Because of this, God greatly exalted him
and bestowed on him the name
that is above every name,
10that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father. Ph 2:7-11

Our God is greater than anything we see, feel or experience. Jesus is Lord over all the earth and the heavens. We need not fear anything as long as we are humbly working out our salvation. Jesus will provide and protect us. Just as Paul was protected from the viper bites.
Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper, escaping from the heat, fastened on his hand.
4When the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must certainly be a murderer; though he escaped the sea, Justice has not let him remain alive.”
5But he shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.
6They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead but, after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god Acts 28:3-6

Remember Jesus promised that the disciples would pick up snakes with their hands and not be hurt.
“they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.” Mark 16:18
Let us know that even if we are in a situation where we have a viper in our hands and it bites us, Jesus will protect us. No venom can kill us because Jesus is in our hearts. We need to just trust in Jesus fully as there are bound to be attacks of the evil on our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 349 By Cynthia Dsilva

Philippians 1:6
*I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.*

In the old Covenant, God's people waited with joyful expectation for the first coming of the Lord. But in the new Covenant, most of God’s people are scared or anxious when they think of the second coming of the Lord and the final judgment, because they are not really sure if they are leading their lives according to God's Will or not and whether they have completed the mission for which they were sent to earth.

Paul was therefore assuring the Philippians, and us, that if we continue growing in holiness as well as working for the growth of God’s Kingdom, then it is not us working but the work of Christ dwelling in us.  Therefore, we don’t have to be anxious about whether or not we will complete our mission before the Lord’s parousia, because what Christ started doing in us, He will definitely finish before the last day, and if we are loyal to Him and allow Him to remain in us as long as we live then we will definitely be with him and share in His eternal glory.

Philippians 1:15-18
*Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.  These proclaim Christ out of love, knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel;  the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment.  What does it matter? Just that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice.*

The Philippians did not have good relations with many people in their neighbourhood.  Even the two ladies, who were working with Paul to assist him in his preaching, had difficulty agreeing with each other (Philippians 4:2).

Although some were preaching the Gospel in Paul’s absence, all the preachers  were not trying to bring people to God out of love for Christ because they weren't leading holy lives themselves.

Some of the preachers were envious of Paul’s popularity and leadership role.  They started preaching because they wanted to grab Paul’s position and popularity for themselves while he was in prison.

Some of them were preaching for their own benefit, while some were preaching out of rivalry against each other, etc.  There were only a few who were genuinely preaching the Gospel out of love for Christ.   But whatever reason the preachers were preaching for, Paul was happy that they were bringing people to God.  Regarding their personal character they would have to deal with God directly.
And so it is with us.

When we do good works with ungodly motives, the beneficiary will definitely benefit from it but our heavenly reward will depend on our motive.

Philippians 1:21\
*For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.*

Christian life is a win-win life because life is Christ and death is gain.
If we receive the Body of Christ in a state of grace at all times (1 Corinthians 11:27) then we will have divine life within us, therefore Satan will not have power over our souls, and if we die with divine life within us then Satan will not be able to claim our souls, and our souls will be raised on the last day (John 6:54).

So, whether we are living or dead in this world, it is a win-win situation because our souls will always be in the custody of Christ (John 10:27-28), therefore, we should not be afraid of death.

Paul was anxiously waiting for his natural death so that he could be with Christ for eternity but God wanted him to stay on earth for a while to accomplish the mission assigned to him (Philippians 1:22-24).

Paul and the other Apostles are not the only ones who had a mission to accomplish. Every Christian has a mission to accomplish for the Lord.
Let us therefore ask the Lord, without delay, to help us know what our mission is, so that we can get busy with helping in the growth of God’s Kingdom as long as we are here on earth while we also maintain our holiness.

Philippians 2:1-8
If we are the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head, then the body must be in sync with the head.

Our body is an analogy for our souls.
If our body does not obey what our head/mind tells us to do, then our body suffers in many ways and we may have to see a doctor for physical treatment. We tell him our symptoms and he prepares/prescribes medicine for us along with some lifestyle changes.

Similarly, if we do not obey what Christ wants us to do, then we suffer in many ways due to our sins and we may have to see a spiritual doctor (the priest) for spiritual treatment.  We tell him our symptoms (sins) and he prescribes some lifestyle changes (penance).  Thereafter he prepares the medicine (the Body of Christ / Communion) for us, to be consumed regularly.

To begin thinking like Christ, Paul is not asking us to move mountains or build projects.  Paul advises us to start with baby steps. He just wants us to do, what we do for others, with love and concern for them, starting with our own families and the people around us, and not by selfishly pursuing our own interests or by looking at others as lower than us.\
Additionally, we must read the scriptures every day (the old and the new).
At all times we must humble ourselves and use whatever power or authority we have in our hands, to serve others, just as Christ did.

Unlike the first Adam, who in his pride grasped at being like God without God, the new Adam (Jesus) humbled himself to become a slave, obedient even unto death on the Cross (Romans 5:12–17). In this He has shown sinners, each one of us, the way back to the Father. We can only come to God to serve in His vineyard (the Church), by having that same attitude as Christ.

Philippians 2:12
*Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.*

Paul was aware that his Baptism was not sufficient for salvation.\
Salvation is an ongoing lifetime process.
We were saved when we were baptized, we are saved during our lifetime whenever we receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, and we will eventually be saved if we die in a state of grace.

We must, therefore, be alert to sin at all times and keep ourselves purified as long as we live.

### Faith and Works

[![Faith and Works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day350.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2lCax3ZsJXk "Faith and Works")

### Day 350 Doers of the Word, not hearer only.

We are called to be not just hearers of the Word but doers as well.
Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.

23For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his own face in a mirror.
24He sees himself, then goes off and promptly forgets what he looked like. James 1:23-24

Imagine going in front of the mirror in the morning and not combing your hair, it seems foolish, doesn’t it. But if we read God’s Word and commands and do not act upon them then we are fooling ourselves.
In the same way, if we say that we have faith that can move mountains but do not have works to prove it, then our faith is dead.
The formula “Believe in your heart and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and you will be saved” is not complete.
Although Faith is necessary but faith alone is not enough, works are needed to demonstrate our faith. We are not hearers only but doers as well. In reality, we are not saved only by faith and works but are saved by grace.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day,
16and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,” but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is it?
17So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead. James 2:14-17

So the next time someone tells you faith only saves, ask them to search the Bible for the words “Faith alone” the only verse that will come up is James 2:17 which said faith by itself is dead.

It is easy to hear God’s word and love it, but hard to act on it. We may feel overwhelmed or powerless to be doers of the Word. Let me encourage you and remind you that God empowers us and we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

I have the strength for everything through him who empowers me. Phil 4:13

And we can rest assured that God will supply all our needs in accordance to the glorious riches we have in Christ Jesus.

My God will fully supply whatever you need, in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. Phil 4:19

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 350 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 1:12-18
God is a Tester, not a Tempter.
God does not tempt us but He does test us by allowing trials and tribulations in our lives.
Temptation is meant to deceive us and lure us into sin, which is the work of the devil, and we can overcome temptations only if our faith, love and trust in God is strong.

*Why is it necessary for God to test us?*
God does not test us for Him to know the result.  He already knows the result before we were born. God tests us so that we can be aware of our spiritual weaknesses and so that we can work on improving in those areas. The trials and tribulations (terminal exams) are meant to help us grow stronger in our faith and love and to prepare us spiritually for our final exam before we leave this world.

James 1:19-27
Our inability to listen to others arises from lack of patience. We are always eager to speak; we always try to give suggestions to others even when they don't ask us for it. Sometimes we have selective hearing. We listen only to the part of the conversation where we can give our knowledge, our opinion, our solutions, our judgement or our reply.  If something we have heard touches our pride, we choose to activate our anger and thereafter harsh words pour out of our mouth.

James is inviting us to listen attentively to others.  This means we must keep our eyes and ears open and maintain our silence, speaking only when it is necessary.

Sometimes we like to talk too much about our own problems, achievements and success but we don't have patience or interest to listen to the problems, achievements or successes of others.

James is advising us to learn to control our tongue, which is the cause of most of our sins, and to focus more on generosity towards the destitute, giving preference to widows and orphans.

James 2:1-9
James addresses one of the major problems in the early Church, which was the issue of discrimination. People were being grouped according to their wealth, possessions, power and status in the secular world.  As a result the less fortunate ones were being ignored and treated with disrespect while the successful ones were given more attention and treated with great respect.

As Christians, we must avoid giving importance to people just because they have a higher material value or status in life, because Jesus gave His life for every human, irrespective of their caste, religion, colour, status, power, etc.

Let us therefore check ourselves and see if we too have been making the same mistake as the early Christians did. If we have, then let us change that from today and start giving more attention to the less fortunate ones (the poor, the needy, the old age homes, etc.) while we treat all humans as equals.

James 2:14-17
James was reminding us of the words of Jesus (Matthew 7:24).
Jesus is not happy with only lip service from us.  He wants to see our works which prove our words (Matthew 25).  We cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbors or if we ignore our neighbors who are in need of help.

We have been created for a purpose and our mission on earth must begin with faith in Christ.  But faith without works is dead faith (James 2:17) because faith without works is only lip service.  Our faith must be tested, and we can prove our faith (belief and trust) in God only by our works (Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 14:12; 20:12–13; 22:12).  Part of our mission on earth is to do good works for Christ by doing good works for others, not for ourselves.

*What is “works”?*
James was speaking about all good works accomplished in Christ.
Loving and trusting God and obeying His commandments, even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations, is called “works.”

James 2:24
Salvation is not through Faith alone.
We enter the Kingdom of God (the Church) through faith but we will be judged by our works.

Philippians 3:2
*Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!*

Paul’s main enemies were the Jewish Christians who refused to accept the decision of the first council in Jerusalem that the gentile converts need not be circumcised.  Those Jewish Christian opponents were creating chaos in the Churches by spreading the erroneous message that for a Christian to be saved they must also follow the Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher food, animal sacrifices, etc.).

Philippians 3:4–11
Before his encounter with Jesus, Paul was puffed up with pride because he was circumcised, he was an Israelite, he belonged to one of the tribes of Israel, he was highly educated in the Mosaic Law under the patronage of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel, and above all, he had zeal for God. Like all Pharisees and Scribes, He believed that he was doing everything that was required to receive eternal life because he obeyed the Mosaic Law word-to-word. But unfortunately there was no feeling in his heart for humans.

Paul was highly educated but he couldn't see the truth.  He wanted to eradicate Christianity, not realizing that he was trying to eradicate the only source of eternal life.
Most of the time our education tends to make us aggressive and arrogant if we are not alert to sin and the devil's tricky ways.

After Paul had an encounter with Christ, he later realized that all his earthly achievements were just trash, compared to the glory that Jesus had offered him, even though the road to eternal life was going to be full of rocks and thorns.

After his encounter with Jesus, Paul wanted to forget his past, he wanted to forget Saul and try his best to follow Christ as Paul, not as Saul. It was the risen Christ within him who made it possible for Paul to face the suffering which he went through thereafter.

Like Paul, we too can sometimes swell up with pride because we are more educated than others, or because we are more successful in this life than others.  But if there is no God in our hearts and in our homes, and if we have no feelings for others, then all our achievements in this life are of no value in God’s eyes.  God is not interested in our success in this life.  God blesses us with earthly success so that we can use it to reach out to the people around us, specially the less fortunate ones.
Following Christ should not be limited to just reading the Bible, attending daily worship / Mass, fasting and praying.  Jesus wants us to open our eyes and ears and help the people around us with love, as if they were our close family members, specially the less fortunate ones.

### Draw Near to God

[![Draw Near to God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day351.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dCcGGslB9lQ "Draw Near to God")

### Day 351 Words have power

We need to remember that our words have power because we are children of God. God created everything with just a word, “let there be light.” James reminds us that we who are teachers should realize that we speak God’s word and hence have to avoid any other bad speech.
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,
2for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also. James 3:1,2

There are 3 striking examples given to demonstrate the importance of the good use of the tongue.

1. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.
2. It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination wishes.
3. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.
   For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
   8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. James 3:3-8

It is very hard as to tame the tongue, we can easily slander, gossip, lie, curse, speak rudely, angry words, insults… Let us pray for the grace to control our tongue, so we will have the strength to control the whole body.
If we take some time to ponder on our speech we may fell as though we are hugging a cactus. But we have to come to terms with reality and draw near to God, for only with God’s strength can we control our tongue.

Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds.
9Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.
10Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you. James 4:8-10

As we draw near to God we come to a realization of our sin and want to cleanse our hands, hearts and tongue. If we humble ourselves before the Lord, Jesus will lift us up.
Let all our words be holy and positive, for our words have power. Let us speak blessings on our children everyday. Let praise be on our lips all the days of our life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 351 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 3:1
*Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.*
When we become teachers of the faith it is possible that we can swell up with pride because we may see ourselves as better than those who we teach.  As teachers of faith it is important that we ourselves practice what we teach others.  We must accept correction from others when we are wrong.

God gave us a tongue to praise and worship Him, not to abuse, curse or speak ill of those who are made in the likeness of God.\
Let us learn to use our tongue to praise and worship God and to bring happiness in the lives of others.
Let us not be quick to find fault with others or to make negative comments about them.
Let us learn to use our tongue to speak well of others, to remember their good deeds, and to express gratitude.
Let us learn to use our tongue to ask for forgiveness from those whom we offend and to forgive those who offend us.
Let us pray to God to help us practice self-control and to use our tongue wisely.

James 3:13-18
As James explains, worldly wisdom is reflected in covering up our sins or tactfully justifying ourselves for a wrong or evil action.  By justifying our ungodly actions we are actually saying that evil is right.
Worldly wisdom causes us to misuse others, specially the less fortunate ones, for our benefit.
Worldly wisdom causes us to pretend that we are perfect and that we have knowledge of everything. We pretend that we are what we are not. We believe that everything we say and do is right, and we refuse to accept corrections.
Worldly wisdom causes us to work for the devil in the name of God.
Thus worldly wisdom causes us to live spiritually bipolar lives.

James advises us to show godly wisdom through our actions and by living good and honest lives.

James 5:7-10
Patience is a virtue which we must practice because we have to wait for God to answer our prayers. While we practice patience we get spiritually healed.
We must have patience before we draw a negative conclusion about a person or a situation.\
We must have patience when dealing with negative people, specially with those who provoke us.

The sibling of patience is time. They collaborate with each other to solve our difficulties or problems and the long wait helps us to understand the situation better.
Let us ask the Lord to give us the grace to be patient at all times, and specially during our difficult times.

James 5:14-15
James was talking about the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick with holy oil.
But James was not introducing this Sacrament as a new procedure.

He was telling the people that they must not let this already existing opportunity go waste.

He was reminding the people to call the Priests when someone was in danger of dying, so that maximum souls could be saved.
The Apostles continued anointing the sick with holy oil, as Jesus had taught them before the Resurrection (Mark 6:13).\
Unlike baptism, this anointing must be administered only by a Priest ("Presbyters" in Greek / elders) (James 5:14) for the Sacrament to be effective, that is, for God's grace to flow through it.

James 5:16
*Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.*
Before the Resurrection the people’s sins were forgiven by God (Jesus) through a Priest (Jesus) (Mathew 9:2-8).
After the Resurrection Jesus commissioned His Apostles/Priests to forgive sins (John 20:21-23), but the grace was given to them only after Pentecost Sunday.

James was not introducing the Sacrament of Reconciliation as a new procedure.  He was just reminding the people of what they already knew about but were probably neglecting.

When we confess our sins we are not really sharing our dirty little secrets with God, because He already knows everything we think, say and do, whether good or bad.  Instead, we are humbling ourselves before God and opening the door to the healing power of His mercy which He wants to give us but cannot, unless we ask for it through His anointed priest.  Confessing our sins to a Priest teaches us to practice humility, which is the virtue that removes Pride, the source of sin.

The words of absolution which come from Jesus through the Priest, are not just the babbling of a clergyman or the performance of a ritual.  Those words are more powerful than when God said “let there be light ….” (Genesis 1:3), and when Jesus said “Lazarus come out” (John 11:43), because creation and Lazarus were not meant to last forever, but our souls will, when we are spiritually healed.
While we spend so much time and effort to keep our physical bodies clean, let us not forget to give regular attention to our spiritual hygiene also.

Colossians 1:24-27
It was the ancient belief that suffering comes only to sinners so the Colossian Christians could not understand why Paul was going through suffering even though he was an Apostle.  Paul was explaining to them why he, and all Christians, must go through suffering.

Paul earlier mentioned that all the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily (Colossians 1:18-19).  If Christ is fully divine then He cannot be lacking in His afflictions or suffering of the Cross.

However, if a sinner's love can cover a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8), then God's infinite love can cover an infinite multitude of sins. Therefore, there cannot be anything lacking in the sacrifice of Christ.  And as Paul himself said, the Blood of the Cross had the power to reconcile, not only humanity but, the entire cosmos to God (v. 20).

But Paul was not talking about the suffering of Jesus on the Cross. He was talking about his own participation (v. 24) which was lacking in the suffering of Christ (Matthew 16:24).

On Good Friday Jesus inaugurated His redemptive suffering and afflictions with the intention that it will continue in His mystical Body through us (the Christians on earth) which is His Church so that He could be united with His bride (the Church).  Therefore, when we (the Christians) suffer, inspite of leading holy lives, we do not suffer in vain.  Rather, we suffer in union with Christ for our own salvation and for the salvation of others.

Let us, therefore, not waste our sufferings by pitying ourselves or complaining or retaliating, etc.  Let us suffer willingly while we offer all our sufferings (aches & pains, sickness, financial problems, legal problems, etc.) to Christ as penance for our sins as well as for the sins of our offenders (if any) or the sins of those who we feel are in need of being saved.

[![Purified by Fire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day352.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SsWsfRY0wCo "Purified by Fire")

### Day 352 Suffering unjustly

Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.1 Pet 2:18

Most people are either complaining about work or their boss, mostly for the right reasons. Bosses can be very hard to deal with as some of them are really corrupt, they are seeking their own gain. However, as Christians, we should be subject to them whether they are good or bad. Now does Jesus want us to be always under the yoke of hard work, absolutely not. God will give you the right job and boss to benefit you. We should always pray for our boss and job and do it to the best of our ability, God will bless us and we will find fulfillment for the dignity of work comes from God.

For whenever anyone bears the pain of unjust suffering because of the consciousness of God, that is a grace.

20But what credit is there if you are patient when beaten for doing wrong? But if you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good, this is a grace before God.
21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps. 1 Pet 2:19-22

If we suffer unjustly because of the consciousness of God we can rest assured we are under grace. God will give us the strength to suffer because Jesus suffered unjustly and set an example for us.
“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.” When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly. 1Pet 2:22-23

So whether we suffer justly or unjustly let us remember to unite our suffering to the suffering of Jesus. When we unite our suffering to Jesus’ suffering our suffering becomes redemptive and we receive a blessing, in fact it is a privilege to suffer unjustly. However if we only suffer unjustly then it may turn to abuse, so we need to make people aware if they treat you poorly. Take a stand for what is right, but also accept your cross until the time it is resolved.

May the Holy Spirit lead 🙏

### BIAY Day 352 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 2:20-25
Circumcision was meant only for the natural male descendants of Abraham but Baptism is meant for everyone, old and young, Jews and gentiles.  God wants every human to belong to His family from the 8th day of their birth so that they can be brought into a relationship with Him and thereby start receiving sanctifying graces.

In the old Covenant all male descendants of Abraham had to be circumcised on the 8th day of their birth even though the old Covenant could not sanctify their souls.
But the new Covenant is more powerful than the old one, and therefore Peter extends the invitation for baptism to adults and children alike, so that they can be brought into the new Covenant without delay.

Three thousand were baptized after hearing Peter's sermon because Peter spoke with the power of the Holy Spirit.

*By his stripes we are healed.*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus we are spiritually and physically healed, but the carrying out of that healing process happens in different ways and at different times.
Original sin is cleansed and we are restored to a state of sanctifying grace through baptism. Our souls are redeemed but our bodies are not.  And even our souls are not immediately restored and perfected.  The disorder of concupiscence remains, that is, the "fomes peccati" (in Latin) or “tendency to sin” that afflicts us until we attain our ultimate goal of final salvation at the end of our lives.

The sanctifying graces which we receive through the sacraments are not only a source of healing and restoration, but they are a summons to spiritual battle.  They enter us into our time of testing that will lead us to our full and final redemption, that will include not only the full and final redemption of our souls, but also "the redemption of our bodies" (Romans 8:23), but only if we are faithful unto death (Revelation 2:10).

Why?
That is because our bodies are not redeemed yet in any sense. This is unlike our souls that have already experienced redemption, but are in a process of redemption / salvation / justification that will reach its completion at the end of life.

When God chooses to heal our bodies, whenever we are physically sick, that is also a participation in the healing that came to us through the Cross.  But it is temporary and points to the more important healing of the soul, as we see in the case of the paralytic when Jesus healed the soul first and then the body (Matthew 9:2-6). The ultimate and absolute healing of the body comes only at the end of time for all humans, with the exception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who did not need any healing of body and soul.

In other words, it means that the healing is not automatic. The healing medicine was prepared by Jesus, spiritually, when He received all His wounds during His passion and death, and also by the holy life He led, but since the time of the Resurrection it has been made available to us for our healing, first during Baptism and thereafter only when we pray and when we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, during which time physical healing may or may not happen but spiritual healing definitely happens.

Colossians 3:5-10
Old person / old self / old man refers to the first Adam and new person / new self / new man refers to the new Adam (Jesus).
The first Adam's sin caused humanity to receive damaged souls which weakened our conscience and therefore we fall into temptations easily.
The new Adam (Jesus) gave us a renewable Covenant so that we, who are baptized, can renew the Covenant whenever we break it, thereby allowing us to restore the divine life within us which gives us the spiritual strength to resist evil and keeps us ready for eternal life.
Our fallen nature can accept evil without any effort, but to resist evil we need spiritual strength which is powerful and we get that power from the sacraments.

Colossians 3:12-21
Divine authority is reflected in human authority. We have 3 persons in the Trinity with God the Father above all but all three are always in unity with each other. Authority does not mean that the subordinates must be misused or abused by their superiors. Authoritative positions are given to us by God so that we can serve others, and not to expect the subordinates to serve us.  Subordinates are given to us by God to assist us in serving others.

An authoritative position gives the person the authority to make rules to enforce discipline, to ensure that everyone obeys the rules, to deal with those who violate rules, to make decisions, to organize things, etc. whether it is in a household, in the Church, at our work place, etc.

By humbling Himself and washing the feet of His disciples (John 13:5), Jesus, the King of all kings, gave us an example of how a person in authority must act.  Let us follow His example.

### Day 353 A gentle and calm disposition

True beauty is not found in fashion, accessories, hairstyles or jewelry. Many people pay to a lot of money on designers cloths and accessories. It's true they may be in fashion but believing that it makes you more beautiful is a lie.
Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,
4but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God. 1 Pet 3:3,4

True beauty is from a gentle and calm disposition, internal beauty of the person is more important than looks.
A calm internal disposition is hard to come by in this disturbing world. But it’s not impossible to have it if can cast all our care unto the Lord.
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.1 Pet 5:7

The God who created everything we see cares about us, so we need not worry about anything, just stay close to God. God will take care of all our needs. We need to just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and we will be exalted in due time.

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet 5:6

We also have to be on the watch because the devil our enemy is prowling around looking for who he can devour, he comes to rob steal and destroy.
Let us stay close to God who cares for us, we will be protected if we stay in God’s shadow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

1 Peter 3:1-2
*Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives’ conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.*

A woman must lead a devout Christian life, following God's commandments faithfully, so that even if her husband does not obey God's Word, the splendour of her Christian life will draw her husband towards Christ.
And Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the best example of a faithful and godly wife.

1 Peter 3:9-10
*But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.*

A priest is a man chosen by God to offer the prescribed sacrifices on the Altar, in the Temple during worship.

*Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people.*

To be "God’s own people" means to be in a Covenant relation with God.  Therefore, to be "not the people of God" means to be outside the Covenant of God (Hosea 2:23b).
Thus the Church is the new Temple as well as the new Israel (Galatians 6:16).

The Theology of Peter's first letter to the Church is of a Church in exile, a Church on a journey, a Church that is moving from this world to the world to come.   And just as the first Israel was taken out of Egypt and thereafter became sojourners, moving through the desert to the promised land, so also the believers to whom Peter wrote this letter, were wandering in the earthly exile and moving towards the heavenly promised land.

Family, married life, good works, prayers, etc.... are all spiritual sacrifices.

1 Peter 3:17
*For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.*

There are 3 reasons why God allows suffering in our lives:

1. To remind us to confess our sins of commission or omission and ask God for forgiveness (1 Peter 4:15).
2. To spiritually heal the good ones (1 Peter 4:14, 16 & 19).
3. To glorify the holy ones, as in the case of Jesus and His mother.
   Whenever we or our families go through suffering, besides praying for a solution or healing, we must focus on making a thorough examination of our conscience and confess any unconfessed sins.

1 Peter 3:19-20
*In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient while God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water.*

This was the last phase of the Messianic mission of Jesus.

Purgatory is a temporary condition for a soul that has passed individual judgment but still has the temporal component of sins to atone for before attaining the beatific vision.

Purgatory / Sheol / Hades is like a spiritual hospital (or preparation room) where the venial sins of the righteous ones are purged after they die so that their souls can be covered with white robes before they stand in front of a divine God.

The souls of the righteous ones of the old Covenant were preserved in the same or similar place for their venial sins to be purged until the holy Blood would be shed and the Gospel would be preached to them by Jesus because, although their earthly bodies had perished, their spirits were still alive (example: story of the rich man and Lazarus).

After His death, Jesus went down to Purgatory and preached the Gospel to the righteous ones of the old Covenant who had fallen asleep and thereafter, as prophesied (Daniel 7:22 & 27), they became saints (Mathew 27:52).  The cloud of witnesses (Hebrews 12:1) are those saints in Heaven (Hebrews 11:4-38).

In the ongoing liturgical celebration in Heaven (Revelation) all the angels and saints together pray for the saints on earth because our damaged human souls are in great need of God’s blessings.

While we owe it to our children to hand down the faith to them, we do owe it to our deceased parents, ancestors and other family members to pray for their souls to rest in eternal peace.
The saints in Heaven intercede for us continuously (Revelation).  By His death, Jesus reconciled God and man and thereby populated Heaven with saints and thus He also reconciled angels and saints.

On 1st November the Church celebrates the feast of all saints who are already in Heaven, and on 2nd November the Church dedicates the day to pray for the souls of all those saints who are waiting their turn in Purgatory.

1 Peter 3:21
*This prefigured baptism, which now saves you.*
Baptism is not the only time when we were saved.
Salvation is a lifetime process.
Christians are first saved (from going to Hell) when they are baptized, which is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit because Jesus paid the price by shedding His blood on the Cross, 2,000 years ago.
Christians are in the process of being saved during their lifetime when they pick up their crosses and follow Christ faithfully and when they faithfully follow the fundaments of their faith (Repentance, Sharing and Serving).
Christians hope to be saved, if they have endured to the end of their lives.

*It is not a removal of dirt from the body but an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.*
The great flood, which took place during the time of Noah, was only a symbol of baptism.
The rituals for washing which were introduced in the old Covenant from the time of Moses, were also symbols of the new Covenant baptism but they were also meant to remove dirt from the body as an analogy for the soul.\
But the baptism of Jesus is more powerful than its symbols.

The baptism of Jesus saves us from Hell because it washes away spiritual dirt (sins), to purify the soul, and thereby restores divine life within us, which in turn provides us with sanctifying graces to perfect our souls, without which we cannot enter Heaven.

*Water without the Trinity* washes physical dirt because water by itself does not have any power.
*Water + the Trinity* washes spiritual dirt (sins) because the water now has the power of God. The power of the Trinity in the presence of water is sufficient to erase the past sins of a person.

Once we are baptized, we can start receiving the regular sacraments (Reconciliation & Eucharist) to keep our souls constantly sanctified as long as we live.

1 Peter 5:8
*Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.*
The devil roars like a lion to scare people into believing that he is the lion of Judah whereas Jesus is the true lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5).

1 Thessalonians 2:11
*As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children.*
This is one of the reasons why we call our priests "Father" because they are our spiritual fathers.

### Partakers of the Divine Nature

[![Partakers of the Divine Nature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day354.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sRt5Az3cnHk "Partakers of the Divine Nature")

### Day 354 Always Rejoice, Pray and Give Thanks

If you want to live like a disciple you ought to follow these three

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks

Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing.In all circumstances give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-27

It could not be stated any more clearly, that it’s the will of God for us to always rejoice, pray without ceasing, and give thanks to God in all circumstances.
If it’s the will of God for us to rejoice always then why is there so much suffering in our lives? Our joy is not mere happiness based on our circumstances, but the inner joy with the knowledge that God is in control of every situation. The rejoicing comes when we count it a blessing to suffer with Christ for the redemption of the world. When we are persecuted for the sake of the Kingdom we count it Joy.

Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you \[falsely\] because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Mat 5:10-12

We are called to rejoice when evil is done against us because of our walk as Christians. Like we read in St Paul’s letter to the Philippians a few days ago, from his prison cell St Paul asks us to Rejoice. He says it twice, again I say rejoice.

Rejoice in the Lord always. I shall say it again: rejoice!
5Your kindness should be known to all. The Lord is near.
6Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.
7Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Have no anxiety at all, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, may your request be known to God.

We should pray always knowing that God will answer our prayer. Actually Thank God as soon as you pray, even before you receive what you want, Thank God for the blessing that He will bestow on you soon. We may feel that God is not answering our prayer but let us remember it is not for God’s benefit that it’s taking time but for our own benefit.
But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day.

The Lord does not delay his promise, as some regard “delay,” but he is patient with you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. 2 Pet 3:9

Although the above scripture is about Jesus’ second coming we can also apply it to our prayer petitions. Even if it seems like a thousand years let us know that God has a plan. So let us be peaceful with the peace that surpasses understanding, thanking God for all the answered prayers and for future blessings. Praying always in the Spirit, using the gift of tongues, with the full armor of God, using the sword of the Spirit the word of God to fight off any anxiety and worry.

Let us always:

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks
   “for this is the will of God.”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

2 Peter 1:4
Saints in Heaven will have certain characteristics of God (example: power, holiness, intelligence, knowledge, love, etc.) but not to the same degree, that is, they will not have the “omni” attributes.  Saints in Heaven will still be human but of a highly superior quality.  They will be children of God, they will be parttakers of God’s divine nature and they will be completely sanctified (1 John 3:2-3).

2 Peter 1:20-21
*Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the Holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.*

Peter rules out the option of personal interpretation of the Scriptures.  The authority to interpret the Scriptures was given only to the apostles who in turn handed it down to their succeeding apostles / Apostolic bishops.

Often cited, along with 2 Tm 3:16, on the “inspiration” of scripture or against private interpretation, these verses in context are directed against the false teachers of 2 Pt 2 and clever tales (2 Pt 1:16). The prophetic word in scripture comes admittedly through human beings (2 Pt 1:21), but moved by the holy Spirit, not from their own interpretation, and is a matter of what the author and Spirit intended, not the personal interpretation of false teachers. Instead of under the influence of God, some manuscripts read “holy ones of God.”

2 Peter 3:8\
*But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.*

We, on earth, are bound by time (days / weeks / months / years, etc.) because light (day) on earth is interrupted by darkness (night) and darkness represents evil.  So when we see light again we call it another day and that’s how we measure time.
But God is not bound by time because in Heaven there is no evil and therefore no darkness, and time cannot be measured when there is no change in the existence of light.

Therefore, even if we complete ten thousand years on earth, in Heaven it is still day 1, which was, which is, and which will be the same forever.\
In other words, there will never be a day 2 in Heaven.

2 Peter 3:9\
*The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.*

There are people who do such horrendous things in society that our minds struggle to understand such things.  Such people make our hearts cry out for justice, and rightly so.  But often we go a step further and condemn them to Hell.\
The revolutionary attitude takes solace in the destruction of the aggressor.\
When people do terrible things, we may sometimes wonder why God does not strike them down immediately and send them to Hell.  But this is not God’s mind.  God is teaching us to desire the conversion of hardened sinners, and to pray for them.
Jesus was thirsty (John 19:28), not only for the souls of the saintly, but also for the souls of the most hardened sinners (Matthew 9:12).

God is slow in punishing the wicked because He waits for His children (the Christians) to carry out His Will by helping the wicked to come to repentance with love, peace, kindness, sacrifice, prayers, etc.

Therefore, when a crime is committed, while we generously pray for the victim we must also remember to pray for the culprit, because God wishes that all should be saved.

In a Covenant relation it is always the innocent ones who suffer / pay the price for the sins of the wicked so that the wicked may be saved, just as Jesus suffered for us so that we may be saved.

1 Thessalonians 4:15-17
*For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died.  For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel’s call and with the sound of God’s trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first.  Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever.*

When Paul wrote to the people to be ready always because the end would come soon, the people stopped cultivation and waited for the end of the world.  Therefore he changed his message later saying that the end would come soon but we do not know when (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12).

After the final judgment, Jesus will send His angels to gather His elect who are left behind (Matthew 24:31; Revelation 11:15), but Paul and the first century Christians believed that this would happen during their lifetime and so Paul was insisting on the Christians to be prepared for the coming of the Lord.  Paul had written the same message to the Corinthians also (1 Corinthians 15:51-52), but the Christians who escaped to the mountains in Pella during the destruction of the Temple, were not taken up alive.  Many of them returned to Jerusalem six decades later.

The prophecy of Jesus (Matthew 24:3-8) was meant, primarily, for Jerusalem, to mark the end of the age of the old creation, the old Covenant, the old sacrifice, the old priesthood, and the old Temple because Jesus had already inaugurated the beginning of the new creation when He was baptized and the only thing standing in the way of the new Covenant, the new sacrifice, and the new priesthood was the old Temple.  Therefore, it had to be removed and the man-made Temple was destroyed in AD 70 because we now have a temple that is not made by hands, the mystical Body of Christ, the Bread of Life.

The destruction of the Temple in AD 70 was, however, a prophetic sign of the future.  The condition of the people was so devastating and horrible that the people thought it was the end of the world.  But what happened to Jerusalem and the Temple locally will happen to the Church globally at the end of time.  The Church (the mystical Body of Christ) must go through its final passion just as the physical Body of Christ did.

Therefore, Paul’s prophecy was about the end times or the second coming of the Lord in His glory before the Last Judgement, and the holy ones who will still be living at that time will not see death but an immediate transformation of their bodies, which means that Jesus will not wait for every single human to die before His second physical appearance.

### The Things of This World

[![The Things of This World](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day355.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DiTWA-wbY2I "The Things of This World")

### Day 355 If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive

One lie of the devil that is spreading rapidly in our younger generation is indifference to God/Religion and relativism. Many people say your truth is your truth and mine is mine. When we have our own standards instead of the standards of God, the concept of sin disappears.

Let us be reminded that we all have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory. If we say we have no sin then we make God to be a liar.

If we say, “We are without sin,” we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
9If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
10If we say, “We have not sinned,” we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 Jh 1:8-10

And for those who follow Christ, we need to be in the light and follow his commandments. This will guarantee that we know Christ if we keep his commandments.

The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep his commandments. Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1 John 2:3-4

We ought to demonstrate our love for Christ by loving our earthly brothers and sisters.
Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness.
10Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. 1 Jh 3:9-10

The world will know us by the love we show to our brothers and sisters. If we say we love God but hate our brother then we are liars and we are not walking in the light.
Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16For all that is in the world, sensual lust, enticement for the eyes, and a pretentious life, is not from the Father but is from the world.
17Yet the world and its enticement are passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains forever 1 Jh 2:15-17

We should not love the things of the world as they are passing away. The world with all its glitter and temporary satisfaction will not fulfill our desires. The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life are all passing away. Let us only focus on love of the Lord and his commands. Let us not lust over our brothers and sisters but love them instead. The path to holiness is to humble ourselves instead of walking around proud and pretending to be great. Let us hold to the highest standard of holiness, which is love. Love our brothers and sisters as Christ loved us.

Let us not fear but repent for If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.2 Th 3:5

May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 355 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 1:8
*If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.*

Sin is not only about robbing a bank or murdering someone or committing adultery.
Due to the fall of man our love for one another has become so distorted that we are not able to love one another without conditions and most of the time we ignore the needy ones.  This distorted love causes us to constantly commit sins in our daily lives, by gossiping, complaining, showing off, talking too much, criticizing, insulting, humiliating, abusive language, etc. etc.  All these are the result of lack of love in our hearts for the people around us and thus, in following these habits, we disobey the new Commandment given to us by Jesus (John 15:12).

Therefore, knowing the weakness of our souls, God sent His Son to give us the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that, whenever we become aware of our sins, we can repent and renew the broken Covenant by confessing our personal sins (1 John 1:9) and receiving the sacrament (John 20:23).  Thereafter we can make atonement for those sins and share in the sacrificial meal so that we can have communion with God once again (John 6:54).

1 John 1:9
If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.\
In the history of salvation, God was not content only to redeem Israel from physical bondage by bringing them out of Egypt (Deut. 5:6) because the people constantly attached themselves to a sinful lifestyle (idolatory, immorality, etc.) and God does not want anyone worshipping Him when they are held in bondage.  Therefore, after redeeming them God saved them from their personal sins by forgiving the sins (Leviticus 4:20b, 26b, 31b & 35b; 5:10b, 13a, 16b & 18; 6:7) which were confessed to Him in the presence of the priest (Leviticus 5:5) who would then make atonement for their sins on their behalf (Leviticus 5:6), to purify them symbolically, because sin is always an offence against God, and only He can forgive it.

After the mortal sin of the first Adam, all humans were destined to go to Hell because nothing unclean must enter Heaven (Revelation 21:27.  But God had a redemption plan in place, therefore, the souls of all the deceased righteous ones were preserved in Purgatory/Sheol (Numbers 20:26; 27:13; Luke 16:25).  By shedding His Blood on the Cross, Jesus redeemed all the deceased righteous people of the old Covenant (Mark 3:27; 1 Peter 3:19-20).

In the new Covenant, however, we are redeemed / released from Satan when we are baptized.

But God was not content only to redeem us.   He knows that, due to the weakness of our souls, we are definitely going to break the Covenant over and over again by committing sins between our baptism and our death and He wants us to maintain our baptismal holiness as long as we live. Therefore, He gave us the purification Sacrament.

So now, if we confess our sins as mandated by God (Leviticus 6:7), He will forgive us our sins and renew the Covenant (John 20:23) which we broke with our sins because confession is not complete until the broken Covenant is renewed, atonement is made for the offense and we take part in the sacrificial meal so that we can once again have communion with God.

Meanwhile, all sins confessed with remorse in our hearts, will be forgiven by God (Leviticus 6:7) except sins which are retained by the priest as permitted by Jesus (John 20:23).

1 John 3:1-3
*See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are.  Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.*

Through baptism, God has given us the privilege of being called “His children.”  Therefore, we must live our lives like children of God and not like children of Satan.
Saints in Heaven will be able to see Jesus as he is, that is, in His glorious state (beatific vision) (Matthew 5:8) because they will be part-takers of God’s divine nature.  But to be able to take part in God’s divine nature we must repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly, so that we may die in a state of grace, that is, in a Covenant relation with God.  Further purification, if required, will be done in Purgatory.

1 John 3:18
*Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.*

God does not want our lip service.  He wants us to prove our love for Him by the way we live our lives, that is, by loving one another without conditions, specially by caring for and sharing with the needy ones.

We don't do any good by sympathizing with the suffering people around us and asking others to help them, if we are not making any attempt to help ease their suffering ourselves.  If we genuinely cannot give them financial support, we can at least give them physical support and pray for them.

If we become aware of someone who is in need of help, it is not by accident.  It is God making us aware because He wants to use our hands to help them.

1 John 3:19-20
*And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.*

Sometimes in the past, when we were angry or extremely annoyed, we may have said or done something that had hurt or damaged someone, severely.  But even after we confessed our sin and we were forgiven, our conscience still torments us because of how we hurt that person.  John assures us that God is aware whether we have truly repented for our sinful behavior or whether we have confessed our sin for other reasons.\
We may succeed in fooling humans / the priests but we can't fool God.

2 Thessalonians 2:15
*Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught, which you received either by word or by a letter of ours.*
The Church didn't have a Bible in hand until the end of the third century AD.  Therefore, the written Tradition which Paul was referring to were all the epistles which he had written to the Christians to correct their errors, discipline them, etc.\
The oral Tradition was however handed down through their successors.

### God Is Love

[![God Is Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day356.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hCHHw_GVAZI "God Is Love")

### BIAY Day 356 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 4:20
*Whoever claims to love God, and yet hates a brother or sister, is a liar. For Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.*

The biblical understanding of true love is to will for the good of others, irrespective of whether they are related to us or not and irrespective of whether they love us or not, because “Love” is self-giving, and when others are in distress or troubled we are willing to pay a price to help them, even if it costs us our lives.

1 John 5:6
*This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is the witness, and the Spirit is truth.*

This verse refers to the baptism (water) and crucifixion (blood) of Jesus.

During the baptism of Jesus, God the Father declared that Jesus was His Son and this was witnessed by the Holy Spirit who appeared in the form of a dove.

When Jesus was crucified, after His death the centurion declared that Jesus was the Son of God.  It is believed that the centurion was inspired by the Holy Spirit because the centurion was a stranger and had no other way of knowing anything about the divine sonship of Jesus.

1 John 5:16-17
*If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one.  This is only for those whose sin is not mortal.  There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that.  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.*

There are two type of sins:  Mortal (deadly or fatal) and Venial (forgiveable).
*Mortal sin* instantly destroys the divine life or the life of God within us, as it did with Adam and Eve.  Divine life gives us the ability to love without conditions but it is still subject to our choice.
*Venial sin* diminishes the divine life within us but does not destroy it instantly.

By virtue of our Baptism we belong to God's family.  Therefore, as an act of charity, and if we ourselves are in the Body of Christ, then we can pray and make atonement on behalf of the living believers on earth (Church militant) or deceased believers who have committed venial sins and are still in the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-26) (Church suffering in Purgatory) and God will restore their divine or supernatural life ("zoay" in Greek).\
We can pray for both types of venial sinners (Church militant and Church suffering) because both types belong to God's supernatural family.  But we cannot make atonement on behalf of the living or dead baptized members who have committed mortal sins because the guilty ones need to repent and that can be done only when they are living.  Moreover, mortal sins sever the baptized members from the Body of Christ.  The living ones can, however, once again become part of the Body of Christ after they repent and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and make atonement for their sins but the deceased ones have no hope of being saved.  Meanwhile, we can pray for the conversion of the living ones (1 Timothy 2:1-2).

1 John 5:18
*We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one cannot touch them.*
Jesus protects us from Satan from the time we are baptized because our baptism puts Satan on a leash therefore he cannot touch our souls (Mark 3:27).  But Satan tries to control us by luring us into his den with his deceptive offers of wealth, power, comfort, entertainment, etc.  To receive those offers we must get close to Satan.  When we choose to get close to him, we are actually going far from Christ and we fall into Satan’s dangerous trap, which is only a candy-coated ball of destruction.  The only way out of the trap is to follow God’s commandments, repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist, regularly, to give us the strength to fight Satan spiritually and stay with Christ.

1 Timothy 2:4
*God desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.*
God has predestined every human for glory.
Damnation is a failure of the human will or persisting in a willful turning away from God, to the end.

A good teacher always wishes that all his/her students must succeed in the final exams.  The teacher provides all the necessary resources, guidance and support to help everyone succeed but some students may still end up as failures by their own choices due to little or no effort from their side.  The teacher, however, did not prepare those students for failure.

We are not robots acting out a pre-programmed script.  We have free will to make our choice so let us make wise choices and choose God’s Will for us.

1 Timothy 2:1-4
*First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way.  This is good and pleasing to God our savior, who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.*
As per the above instructions of Paul, our petitions for our country, community, world, etc. are/must be included during Mass (Prayer of the Faithful) every Sunday because the sins of Christians have a negative effect on the community and environment around us.  Therefore, since the Church is a universal institution, we must pray for all people, specially for the Church and for those who are responsible for the welfare of the country.

During this intercession (Prayer of the Faithful) we must pray for:

1. the Church.
2. the world
3. the government
4. the sick and the suffering
5. specific needs
6. the deceased members of the community.

These are the prayers which are received by the angels and saints in Heaven and answered by God according to His Will (Revelation 5:8).
These prayers are sent up to God because we are part of the Communion of Saints in Heaven through baptism, but we have still not accomplished our mission on earth.  We encounter many obstacles in our daily lives which make it difficult for us to accomplish our mission on earth and remain holy, due to the damaged nature of our souls and because we are still in the flesh.
These prayers include general needs of the Church community, the public authorities, the oppressed, etc., whatever could be a possible obstacle in maintaining the holiness of the Church (God’s people).

1 Timothy 2:5-6
*For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and man, Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all.*
Jesus is the only mediator between God the Father and man, but not the only intercessor.  Jesus can mediate because He is both God and man.

### Day 356 One Mediator and Traditions

We all have Christian names and go to church, but what really shows that we are Christians is the love that we have each other.

Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.
8Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another.
12No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us.
We love because he first loved us.
20If anyone says, “I love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
1 Jh 4: 7,8,11,12,19,20

So it is obvious that God loved us first and we received a nature of love from God as we are Children of God. As children of God we ought to love God and love our neighbor. Loving God can seem easy as we need to follow his commandments and we receive a lot of love from God. It can seem awfully hard to love our neighbor as we live among broken people. People have anger problems and can be liars, lovers of money, blinded by lust and selfish. We also naturally love ourselves a lot and find it hard to love others like we love ourselves.
Who can save us from this, thanks be to God, the one in me is greater than the one in the world.

You belong to God, children, and you have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 1 Jh 4:4:
We should draw strength from the Holy Spirit in us, to fight off the evil forces outside us.
On a couple of apologetic topics, there is usually a lot of confusion about the one mediator verse in Timothy.

For there is one God.
There is also one mediator between God and the human race, Christ Jesus, himself human,
6who gave himself as ransom for all. 1 Tim 2:5,6

This is used a lot against the sacrament of confession – we also know that Jesus instituted the sacrament himself and gave authority to the apostles to forgive sins. Just as they act as mediators to baptize people or pray for healing or preach God’s word. Mary and the saints are also mediators of God’s grace from heaven. The heavenly church(church glorified) does not have any powers or graces of their own, they are but mediators that bring our prayer intentions to God.
Another topic is that the Bible is the ultimate source of truth. For starters the Bible never claims to be the ultimate source of truth, in fact, it was the church led by the Spirit that put the Bible together. Jesus never gave us a book but he gave us a Pope – Peter and gave him authority which got handed over to this very generation.

But if I should be delayed, you should know how to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth. I Tim 3:15

In fact the Bible says that Church is the pillar and foundation of truth. And that the apostles and prophets are the foundation of the Church.
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone. Ep 2:20

Also we are called to hold firm to the traditions of the church which have be taught through word and letter.

So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter. 2 The 2:15

So here is an apologetics 101 answer to the questions the “one Mediator” and “Sola scriptura -Bible alone”

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 357 The love of money is the root of all evils

We live in a very materialistic world and people try to buy themselves out of all problems. This approach will never leave anyone fulfilled. Money can’t buy you everything in fact the more money one has the more one wants to get. Many people have spent their whole lives trying to be successful and end up so sick that they can’t even enjoy the money they saved.
For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. 1 Tim 6:10

We see people working multiple jobs to make it big in life, constantly thinking of how to make more money. This has caused them to skip Mass and other important spiritual activities. This also has drawn people away from family life. We see many young couples not wanting kids because they want a successful career. Let us stop for a moment and think what if we gain the whole world but lose our soul.
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction. 1 Tim 6:9

For we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it. 1 Tim 6:7

Let us remember that we came in empty-handed into this world and we will take nothing back with us.
Alexander the Great who conquered most of the world said “With my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I want people to know that I came empty-handed into this world and likewise will go empty-handed from this world.”
Let us learn from Alexander the Great that when we die we take nothing with us.
Let us learn from the rich people who commit suicide due to depression that money does not buy everything.
In fact, the more money we give away for a good cause, the happier we feel. The other extreme is also dangerous, where people don’t want to spend anything on themselves.
When we give we should be smart in giving, as some people are in the habit of taking money and having a good time. Like beggars who only beg to have their next drink or joint.
There are also lazy and greedy people in this world who would take money even though they are not truly in need.
In the early church, some widows were probably taking advantage of the church’s generosity. The apostles had to become prudent about who gets aid and who does not.
If any woman believer has widowed relatives, she must assist them; the church is not to be burdened so that it will be able to help those who are truly widows. 1 Tim 5:16

So the next time you think of giving someone money, pray about it and try to use sound judgment. Give to those who are in need and will really use it. For example, you may want to give food instead of money to a drunk.
The Lord will bless us with good finances if we don’t run after money. Seek first His kingdom and all things will be added to you.
The right use of money is essential.
7Tell the rich in the present age not to be proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing as wealth but rather on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.
18Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, ready to share,
19thus accumulating as treasure a good foundation for the future, so as to win the life that is true life. 1 Tim 6:17-19

Our goal is eternal life, money will come and money will go, but our soul will live forever.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 357 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Timothy 4:14
*Do not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate.*
By the laying on of their hands, the Apostles ordained Timothy and other men to serve as presbyters (priests), under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

Timothy was later appointed as the Bishop of Ephesus.

1 Timothy 6:10
*For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.*

Money is not evil.  What is evil is the kind of person who we become when we start giving more importance to our money.  It is the love of money that gives rise to evil.\
When money becomes our god (idol worship), then we start inviting evil spirits into our lives and into our homes.  Our love for money causes us to fight with others, break human relations, and sometimes go to extreme ends (fraud, lies, murder, theft, false accusations, etc.) to possess it.

When money comes into our hands we feel we are superior to others and we begin to disrespect the ones who are financially below our level.\
When we have a successful career we start idolizing our jobs because of the money it brings in.\
Sometimes we also idolize our possessions because we spent a lot of money on them.\
Even if we worship God on the side, our focus will always be on the people and activities which bring in money.  We give less or no time and importance to God, but more time and importance to the people and areas related to money.

When God blesses us financially, He expects us to raise our *standard of giving*, not our *standard of living*, but when we have money with us the temptation to *keep* will be much stronger than the desire to *give* and we may find all kinds of excuses why we *cannot* and *should not* and *must not* give.

We are not supposed to love our money.  God wants us to spread love, live a simple life and share our extras with the less fortunate ones around us.

Paul was writing to the Christians in Ephesus who may have been living in obedience to the Church laws and the commandments, but were also carried away with unhealthy practices in their desire for acquiring riches.
Even a faithful Christian who keeps all God’s commandments, obeys the Church laws and attends Church service / Mass regularly, can flow with the crowd and get tricked by the devil into believing that it is not wrong to do such things.  Therefore we must be very careful about the kind of people we associate with.

Idol worship is a direct violation of God’s commandment and is therefore a mortal sin, and as Paul warns us, we must not receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist in a state of mortal sin (1 Corinthians 11:27).  It is therefore important that we repent, receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and change our lives before receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).

Without the grace of God we cannot give freely the way God wants us to give. Therefore we must pray to God daily to give us that special grace.

### From Rebellion to Faithfulness

[![From Rebellion to Faithfulness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day358.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QherEWxqLcc "From Rebellion to Faithfulness")

### Day 358  St Michael the ArchAngel protect us

In today’s reading we see St Michael come up.
Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment\* upon him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” Jude 1:9

St Michael the Archangel comes up a few other times in Daniel and the book of the revelations to mention a few. St Michael is also attributed with the angel in the garden of eden and the angel that led the Isrealites in the desert. Catholic tradition also attributes St Michael of taking Mother Mary to Heaven when her time on earth was over.
St Michael is considered the guarding of the Church as he is always seen fighting and defending the church.
The popular prayer (below) to St Michael the Archangel is condensed from the prayer Pope Leo XIII wrote in 1886 when he had that horrific vision of the demonic spirits gathering on the eternal city (Rome) and Satan threatening to destroy the church in 100 years.
Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel:
"St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen"
This prayer is a very powerful prayer that we should include in our daily devotions, pray it in the morning, on your commute, over your children, over the sick, over those who are in danger of death, for protections against temptations, for physical and spiritual protections from the evil one.
St. Michael the Archangel has always been known to be a powerful intercessor against evil, especially since he is recorded in the Book of Revelation as, “fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven” (Revelation 12:7-9). Based on this episode in scripture, St. Michael is frequently depicted in art thrusting a lance, spear or sword into Satan, who is often depicted as a serpent or dragon.
Let us not fail to invoke the protection of St Michael the archangel everyday.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 358 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jude 1:9
*But when the archangel Michael argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, Michael did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”*

If an Archangel refrained from reviling the devil, then it is even more wrong for mere humans to revile the angels or any of God’s creation, irrespective of whether they are good or bad.

God sends rain and sunshine on the good as well as on the evil (Mathew 5:45), because in God’s eyes we are all His children and we are all equal.  Even the bad angels were created by God therefore we don’t please God when we revile or speak ill of the bad angels or bad people.  Instead, when we revile the bad ones we are actually making a Covenant with Satan to fight with his devils, and Michael was aware of this.
God wills that everyone should be saved (1 Timothy 2:4-5), therefore, instead of being judgemental about those who have gone away from God, let us help them to come back to God.

Normally Satan is always interested in claiming souls of the dead but this time he was interested in the body of the dead.

It is not clear why Satan was interested in the body of Moses but Satan does not have the power to use the bodies of the dead because he would have to resurrect those bodies in order to use them and that requires infinite power which he does not have. Only God can truly raise the dead.

Satan is, however, constantly trying to stop God’s will from being executed in the world.  Therefore, most likely, he would either have been given the knowledge that God has a special plan for the body of Moses or he may have guessed it because of the angelic activity that would have surrounded the body of Moses along with Michael.\
Moses, eventually, did appear during the transfiguration of Jesus, which was witnessed by three of the apostles.

Jude 1:11
*Woe to them! They followed the way of Cain, abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error for the sake of gain, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.*

*What was Korah’s rebellion?*
Korah was a non-ordained Levite, but his 250 men were not even Levites and yet they all claimed that they too were holy and could offer the sacrifices relegated to the priesthood (Numbers 16:3), even though they were not called by God for the priesthood.  By protesting against Moses and Aaron who were God’s anointed people, they were protesting against God.  Therefore the earth opened up and swallowed them and thus they all perished physically.

Jude did not write to the Jews but to Christians and warned us not to claim what is not allowed to us.  We are required to carry out whatever mission God has assigned to us even if it has no significance.  Whatever mission we carry out on earth is all part of God’s plan therefore we must not be picky and choosey about what we are expected to do.  If we protest against God’s anointed people, we will perish spiritually (Hell).

Cain was envious of his own brother and therefore killed him.
Balaam was given supernatural power but he used his gift to fill his pockets.

Let us not imitate any of these three men.

2 Timothy 1:1-7
Paul had developed a very close friendship with Timothy who was also very active in the Church and someone whom Paul could entrust with the preaching of the Gospel.

It is very important for us to have friends who walk with us towards God.

Timothy learnt about the faith from his mother and grandmother.

It is important for us to live our faith as true Christians so that the next generation will see our fidelity to Christ and pass that on to their future generations.

Paul was writing from prison and at that time Timothy may have not felt confident enough, on his own, to handle the negative issues that the Church has to constantly face.  But Timothy was going to be Paul's successor therefore Paul was writing words of encouragement to Timothy that by his ordination he received a Spirit of power, not of fear. Therefore Timothy was required to stir up the Holy Spirit, boldly face the attacks of the evil one, whether physical or spiritual, and stand for the truth, while maintaining his own holiness, even if it meant that he had to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

But this advice was not only for Timothy.

When we receive the Holy Spirit through the sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, etc.) we are required to obey God and pray to the Holy Spirit every day to help us keep His flame burning in us always, as long as we live, so that we can be instrumental in making Christ known to the people around us by the way we live our Christian lives, even if we have to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

*For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands;*
By the power of God invested in them through their ordination, the Bishops and priests bring God's graces to their congregations in a special and reverent way, through the sacraments.

*For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but a spirit of power and love and self-control.*
The Lord will always give us the love and self-control we need to bear our share of hardship for the Gospel, with a strength that can come from God alone.
Our task is to continue doing what He has commanded, to love and to build up His kingdom.

2 Timothy 2:14-19
It is not wrong to be a good public speaker but using that talent to mislead people and take them away from God for selfish reasons is wrong.

2 Timothy 1:8-10
Paul was addressing Timothy but this epistle is valid for Christians of all times.
Many of the first century Jewish Christians believed that when a person becomes a Christian he will be free of suffering, because it was the ancient belief in Israel that suffering is caused by the sins of either the suffering person or his parents (John 9:2).  They were probably of the opinion that baptism will wash away all the sins of their lifetime (past, present and future).  But the reality is different.

Suffering is not always caused by our sins.  Sometimes we have to suffer because of our faith in Christ.\
By our baptism we are adopted into God’s family and we become missionaries of Christ to help in the growth of the Church (the Kingdom of God on earth).  But we cannot become members of God’s family unless we are sinless, and baptism washes away all past sins including original sin, but not our future sins.

According to God’s initial divine plan, man and woman were to increase and multiply and fill the earth (Genesis 1:28).  At that point the earth was sanctified and man & woman were holy and full of grace.  Therefore, man & woman were given the responsibility to fill the earth and worship God on earth, as it is in Heaven, until it was time for man & woman and all their progeny to go to God.  But when sin entered the world God had to alter His divine plan.

Therefore Baptism is not the result of our works.  It is a gift from God to save us from eternal punishment by entering His Kingdom on earth (the Church) and preparing ourselves to have communion with Him for eternity by worshipping Him in a state of grace and growing in holiness through the sacraments, while we also busy ourselves with the growth of His Kingdom on earth by filling the Church with souls.

This means, after we are baptized we must be willing to share the suffering of Christ even to the point of death, because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there’s strong resistance from the demonic, and that is because sin still exists in the world.  Jesus came to earth to divinize the world with His touch, but because of sin He had to suffer, shed His Blood and taste death.

Paul was reminding Timothy, and us, to take our share of suffering for the Gospel (or “good news”) because each individual Christian, as a member of the Body of Christ, has a share in the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ for the sake of the Gospel.
Paul used the word “Gospel” to refer to the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.\
We are called to the faith by a Holy Calling, through the grace of baptism, the very reason for which we were created.

2 Timothy 2:8-13
In baptism, Christians die spiritually with Christ and hope to live with him and reign with him forever, but Christian life includes endurance, witness, and even suffering, as Paul’s own case makes clear; while he is bound by chains in prison, for preaching the Gospel (2 Timothy 2:9), he continues teaching his people because the Word of God is not chained.  By his example he shows us that nothing should stop us from our love for God and sharing the Word of God with others (Romans 8:35-37).   Therefore Paul’s sufferings are helpful to the elect for obtaining the salvation and glory available in Christ (2 Timothy 2:10), who will be true to those who are faithful even through suffering, and will disown those who deny him (2 Timothy 2:12).

### John's Apocalypse

[![John's Apocalypse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day359.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cLKNkdyrb94 "John's Apocalypse")

### Day 359 Behold I stand at the door and knock.

In the book of the revelations John finds himself in what seems like heaven, he finds himself face to face with Jesus. Of Course it’s hard to describe in human language what he actually saw and heard. He tries to compare it to things that we can relate to, the phrases “like a fiery flame”, “voice was like the sound of rushing water “, “his face shone like the sun at its brightest.” It is impossible to describe God, especially when we encounter Him in all his glory. Our reaction would be no less than John’s reaction, in fact we may be even more fearful as none of use are as worthy as John who stood by Jesus at the cross, accepted Jesus’ mother Mary as his own and even was willing to die for Christ, he was boiled but did not die - thrown on the island of Patmos to die.\
When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his feet as though dead. He touched me with his right hand and said, “Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last, the one who lives. Once I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys to death and the netherworld. Rev 1:17,18
Jesus has already died on the cross for us and paid for our sins. He rose again and lives forever, now Jesus holds the keys to death and life and wants us to make every effort possible to be saved. Many have the idea that Jesus died for us and we don’t need to do anything to go to heaven. Not doing anything is like having a billion dollars in the bank but not using it. The reading in Timothy that we heard today drives this point home.
7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. 2 Tim 4:7-8
Tying the above scripture to the words of Jesus “To the victor” repeated in all the instructions to the 7 churches, we know for a fact that we are to keep fighting and running the race, keeping the faith till the end, we will receive the crown of righteousness not just because of our holiness but because of our faithful persistence in living a good life and loving Jesus.
“To the victor, who keeps to my ways until the end,I will give authority over the nations. Rev 2:26
We all are trying our best and working in the Lord’s vineyard enduring many sufferings but we need to ask ourselves this question everyday, “Have we lost our first love for Christ?” “Are we just going through the motions and have lost our desire to have an intermittent loving relationship with Christ?”
“I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate the wicked; you have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not, and discovered that they are impostors. Moreover, you have endurance and have suffered for my name, and you have not grown weary.
Yet I hold this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. Rev 2:2-4
As time goes on in our spiritual lives we tend to become mediocre in our faith. Sunday Mass seems like an obligation and doing charity seems like a burden. We don’t seem to have any desire to evangelize and seem to be very fickle in our holiness. Let us read these words of Jesus and repent of any such laziness.
“I know your works; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. Rev 3:15-16
Reading this harsh warning may cause us to get afraid of Christ, but remember God only Chastises the ones He loves. Jesus always wants the best for us, he gives us many opportunities to repents and is always standing by the door waiting to come into our lives and redeem us.
Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise. Be earnest, therefore, and repent. “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, \[then\] I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me. Rev 3:
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 359 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation (Introduction)
The Book of Revelation has always been a scary story for many people, the same feeling that Adam and Eve went through when they chose to see the Word of God through the eyes of Satan.\
But at the beginning of the Bible, after the fall of Adam & Eve, God had promised to redeem us (Genesis 3:15).  Thereafter, throughout the Bible, God has been giving us hope for a glorious life with Him for eternity.  God would therefore NOT go back on His promise and drown our hope with a scary story at the end of the Bible because God is a loving Father who always keeps His promises.
This Book is not a warning about future geopolitics or an instruction book for the end-times.\
For the first century Christians, this book was about current and future events.\
For us in the 21st century, this book is about past, present and future events.\
This book shows us how God is worshipped in Heaven so that we understand why we must follow a liturgical service to worship God on earth.

The Book of Revelation is a summary of the entire Bible. Therefore we will not be able to understand the Book of Revelation unless we understand the entire Bible (old and new Testaments).

For the first century Jewish Christians, the Book of Revelation was a picture of the Temple in Heaven and the heavenly liturgy, which seemed to match with their earthly Temple and their earthly liturgy.
Like Moses (Exodus 25:9), King David also received the plan of the Temple from God Himself.

The Temple was to be built according to the Court/Temple of Heaven (Wisdom 9:8; Hebrews 8:5).
Therefore the liturgy of the first Passover, which God gave to Moses, and the liturgy of the new Passover (the Mass), which Jesus gave to the Apostles, were meant to be replicas of the ongoing liturgy in Heaven.
Whereas Israel worshipped God in imitation of the angels, John saw one common worship in the heavenly Temple shared by men and angels.
Whereas only priests were allowed in the Holy place of Solomon's Temple, in Heaven there was a nation of priests (Revelation 5:10).
The Jewish Christians could also see many things happening in Heaven exactly as they celebrated the new Covenant Passover (the Mass):

The union of Heaven and earth, during Mass, is like the fruitful union of a man and his wife in love.  That is why the Church is called “the bride of Christ” and the book of Revelation unveils that bride.  The “apokalypsis” is therefore the communion of the Church and Christ, which is also referred to as “the marriage supper of the Lamb.”

The same imagery is used in the Book of Revelation for the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9) because our physical marriages on earth reflect the spiritual marriage between Jesus and His bride (the Church).

The best way to understand the Book of Revelation is to see it in the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass, and the best way to understand the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass is to see it in the Book of Revelation.  Both must go together; they are inseparable; they cannot be divorced.

Worship, in Heaven includes :

1. the Liturgy of the Word, and
2. the Liturgy of the Eucharist / new Passover.

The two halves of the Heavenly liturgy correspond with the two parts of the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass on earth.

In chapter 1, Jesus blesses the Lectors who read the three Readings (the Scriptures and Psalms) at the beginning of the Liturgical Service during Mass; Jesus also blesses those in the congregation who hear the Word of God attentively and apply it to their lives.

Chapter 2 represents the Penitential Rite where Jesus reminds the congregations to repent for their sins.

2 Timothy 3:14-15
*But you, remain faithful to what you have learned and believed, because you know from whom you learned it, and that from infancy you have known the sacred scriptures, which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.*

Learning scripture must be started at a young age, preferably from childhood, as commanded by God, because our memory power is strongest than when we get older.  Timothy was able to learn the Scriptures during his childhood because his mother and grandmother were godly women.  Like them, if we help our children to be familiar with the Scriptures when they start learning to speak, it will help them to know how to face negative situations and fight evil as they grow up, just as Jesus did (Matthew 4:3-10), and thus remain close to God at all times.

2 Timothy 3:16-17
*All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof/ refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the one who belongs to God may be competent/proficient, equipped for every good work.*

“Theopneustos” in Greek means Inspired or God-breathed.
But although the scriptures are the Word of God, they bear the style of the human authors.
This is a mystery similar to the incarnation.

Just as the Word of God in flesh is both human and divine, so also the Word of God in scripture is both human and divine (God’s Word written by human hands) (Exodus 34:1 & 27-28).
Just as the Word of God in flesh took on every nature of humans except sin, so also the inspired Word of God in scripture comes to us with all the limitations of human language, except errors.

Scripture was not dictated by God. The Holy Spirit inspired the Evangelists to write the scriptures but allowed them to use their talents to write, so the accounts recorded by all four are not exactly the same word-to-word.  It is like the Holy Spirit taking a picture of the same object with four cameras of different brands.

God is its principal author, with the writer as the human collaborator.
Thus the Scriptures are the Word of God in human language.

Paul tells Timothy to continue in what he has learned for two reasons:
a) because he has been educated in the scriptures, and;
b) because he knows from whom he has learned it (Paul himself).  This is a direct appeal to apostolic tradition, the oral teaching which the apostle Paul had given Timothy.

If we don't understand the Bible then it just means we have to study it in more detail or do some research ourselves under the guidance of the right teachers.

But although all scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for correction, for training in righteousness, etc., teaching the faith is not limited only to written scripture, because faith cannot be understood completely only from written tradition.  To understand faith completely we need the help of the written tradition as well as the traditions handed down by word of mouth, which we need to hold fast to, as Paul tells us (2 Thessalonians 2:15).

2 Timothy 4:21
*Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.*

After the death of Peter, Linus was chosen to be the successor of Peter as the second Pope / Prime Minister of the holy Kingdom.  Linus was a Roman Christian.

### Heavenly Worship

[![Heavenly Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day360.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rnn_VeSKdTQ "Heavenly Worship")

### Day 360 Mass - heaven on earth as understood in the book of Revelations.

As we read through the book of revelations we can feel lost and the book can seem very Sci Fi or apocalyptic. The verse that can put it into perspective is

I was caught up in spirit on the Lord’s day and heard behind me a voice as loud as a trumpet. Rev 1:10

It was the Lord’s day which is Sunday for the Christian as Jesus rose from the dead on Sunday. The early Christians would celebrate the Eucharist on Sunday, John was alone on the island of Patmos and Jesus wanted to reveal to Him what actually happens during Mass. The heavens are open and the church militant(us) is united to the Church glorified (Saints and Angels in heaven) in the worship of the Lamb of God. The book of revelations shows how the Eucharist is the wedding feast of the Lamb where heaven and earth unite.

The Lord’s Supper, because of its connection with the supper which the Lord took with his
disciples on the eve of his Passion and because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb in
the heavenly Jerusalem. CCC 1329

The title the “wedding feast of the Lamb” is seen in the book of Revelation.

“Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding
feast of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These words are true; they come from God.”” Rev 19:9

The book of Revelation was written in a coded or concealed form such that the Roman Empire
would not discover the actual context. However, a deeper reading can help us find clues that
the book has a lot of references to the Eucharist.

As already mentioned it was the Lord’s day that John was caught up in the spirit. Rev 1:10

He sees an altar Rev 8:3 ;
candles Rev 1:12 ;
incense Rev 5:8 ;
priests dressed in robes Rev 4:4 .
And he sees bread or manna Rev 2:17
and bowls or chalices of blood Rev 16 .
He sees heavenly worshippers – angels and saints – crying, “Holy, Holy, Holy” Rev 4:8
singing a hymn to the glory of God, the heavenly king Rev 15:3-4 and
shouting “alleluia”; Rev 19:1,3,6
making the sign of the cross on their foreheads Rev 14:1 .
finally, the “wedding feast of the Lamb Rev 19:9 .

The multiple use of the word “lamb of God” and more importantly Jesus’s words

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, \[then\] I
will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me.” Rev 3:20
At the wedding feast of the Mass, Jesus comes into our hearts through the door, our mouth when
we receive the most eloquent of all foods Jesus’s body and blood and He dines with us. Jesus is
the Bridegroom and the church is the bride, the Eucharist in the intimate union of the
Bridegroom and the bride, the church Militant, Suffering and Triumphant.

1382 The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial memorial in which the
sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and the sacred banquet of communion with the Lord’s
body and blood. But the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward the
intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion. To receive communion is to
receive Christ himself who has offered himself for us.

At this sacred banquet we received Christ himself and are intimately united to Him and to the
Church. The Eucharist forms sacred links uniting the faithful, we are one body in Christ.
“The communion of the sacraments are sacred links uniting the faithful with one another and
binding them to Jesus Christ, it is primarily the Eucharist that brings this communion about.”

CCC 950
The Early church not only proclaimed the Eucharist but also remembered Jesus in the daily
breaking of the bread.
“In the first community of Jerusalem, believerst ;devoted themselves to the apostles teaching
and fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and the prayers. This sequence is characteristic of
the Church’s prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated by charity; nourished in the
Eucharist.” CCC 2624

In conclusion let us not forget that we are “Blessed” to partake in this sacrament for it’s the most
intimate union one can have with God on earth. Jesus is truly present in the Eucharist, body,
blood, soul and divinity. This prayer from the Eucharistic liturgy reminds us that we are truly
blessed,

“Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the lamb”. Rev 19:9
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 360 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 4:1-2
This was a shadow of the new Covenant Sunday worship (John saw the vision on a Sunday).
After our sins are forgiven during the Penitential Rite of the Mass, when the Priest invites us to ‘Lift up our hearts’ and we agree by saying, “we lift them up to the Lord,” like John, our spirits are lifted up to Heaven to continue worshipping God with the angels and saints in Heaven, while our bodies are still on the earth.

Jesus invites us up to Heaven every Sunday, not by dying but, in the spirit, to worship God.
When we worship the Lord during Mass on Sundays, we are actually attending the Mass with Jesus in Heaven, not in body but, in spirit.

Revelation 4:4
The 24 Elders or Priests ("Presbyteroi" in Greek) in Heaven were represented by the 24 Priestly divisions who served in the Temple in any given year.\
In Heaven, the 24 Elders/Priests are the Patriarchs of the 12 tribes and the 12 Apostles.

Revelation 4:5
This was represented by the Minorah in the Temple of the Old Covenant, the Minorah being a foreshadow of the Holy Spirit.
The Seven flaming torches are the 7 Archangels who stand in front of the Throne of God and always serve Him (Revelation 8:2), as per Archangel Raphael (Tobit 12:15).

Revelation 4:6-7
The four living creatures before the Throne in Heaven were represented by the four Cherubims carved on the wall of the Temple.
The four living creatures are the apex of the praise of God in Heaven;
The four evangelists are the apex for proclaiming the Word made flesh on earth by giving us the accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Christ.

This was the same vision which was shown to Moses (Numbers 2:1-34).  The 12 tribes of Israel were to be stationed around the four sides of the Temple, with 3 tribes in each group, so that when God looked down at them from heaven it looked like a Cross.  The priestly tribe (the Levites) were to be stationed at the center of the Temple.

Revelation 4:8
Jesus has made us worthy to receive Him in the company of angels and saints in God’s holy Temple, because we have been purified during the Penitential Rite of the Mass (Revelation chap. 2 & 3).  We therefore join the angels and saints in glorifying God with their unending hymn of praise, around God’s Altar, the hymn which was heard even by Isaiah after he was purified “Holy, holy, holy, Lord of hosts, Heaven and earth are full of Your glory…......” (Isaiah 6:3).
At this point Heaven and earth become one and both worship God together.

The battle between good and evil will not be over until the bride of Christ (the Church) will be handed over to God the Father and *all the angels and saints* will sing "holy, holy, holy,,......" in Heaven.

Revelation 4:10
Worship in heaven is physical as well as vocal. There's a lot of bowing down and kneeling, along with prayers, which are signs of humility and reverence.

God has given us a flexible body so that we can use it to worship and glorify Him.
We join our hands in prayer, we kneel to humble ourselves when praying, we genuflect in reverence, we stand to sing hymns and hear the Gospel, we sit to sing hymns and hear the Readings (other than the Gospel), we bow our heads or back in adoration or reverence.

Revelation 5:1
God had a message for His people.

The scroll contained the promises of the New Covenant Law (the Gospel) which only the Lamb of God was worthy enough to open and read in heaven because He was the only sinless One who was worthy enough to be the Lamb for the New Covenant to save the world.

The early Christians read the Word of God (Old Testament) from scrolls during the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass). They did not have the Old Testament combined in a book (the Bible) (Luke 4:17) and they did not even have the New Testament document because it was not documented till the end of the first century.   The books of the Bible (Old and New Testaments) were combined into one book much later (around the 4th century AD) by Saint Jerome.  Thereafter the Church has always read the Word of God (Old and New Testaments) from the Bible.

Revelation 5:5-6
Jesus is the only one who can proclaim the Word of God through our anointed priests and Deacons, during the the Mass.
Jesus, the king of the universe, is compared to a lion, the king, to symbolize His victory (Genesis 49:9).

Then I saw between the throne ……………. a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered/slain.
Jesus wasn't walking on four legs like the earthly lambs, and an earthly lamb cannot hold a scroll or anything else with its front paw.
The Lamb was a representation of Jesus in His humanity.

Christ has died, Christ has been buried, Christ has risen, Christ has ascended, Christ is enthroned as the Paschal Lamb, but He went to Heaven with His wounds still fresh (John 20:27), not with His wounds healed, because God's people have not stopped sinning.  He still looks like a slain Lamb because He continually offers His crucified Body and Blood (the Passover Lamb) to God the Father, during every celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), in atonement for our sins (Hebrews 7:25).
During Mass, when the Priest lifts up the bread & wine together (the Body of Christ) to invite the congregation to the marriage feast of the Lamb, at this point the bread & wine is the resurrected Lamb of God, standing as if slain, with His fresh wounds.

*Seven horns and seven eyes; these are the Seven spirits of God sent out into the whole world.*
Christ has the fullness of power (horns) and knowledge (eyes) (Zechariah 4:10) and His Spirits have been sent out to all the Parishes of the Church all over the world, not only the 7 Parishes which He addressed in chapters 2 & 3.
This is the daily scenario in Heaven and is the same scenario on earth when God's Kingdom comes down on earth during the Liturgical service (Mass) in Church, and Heaven and earth resound together in praising and worshipping God.

*Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep.  The Lion of the tribe of Judah, has conquered." Then I saw a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered.*
The “Lion” is a “Lamb” and it has conquered by being slaughtered.
Jesus didn't conquer the world's greatest enemy (Satan) with worldly weapons and violence. Jesus conquered Satan by rejecting Satan's offers on how to save His Body from suffering, and chose to suffer by humbling Himself like a lamb.
Satan comes to each of us too, in many different ways, with his juicy offers.
But like Jesus, we too must conquer Satan by dying to the comfort and pleasures and ways of this world, so that we may rise with Jesus.

Revelation 5:7
During every Mass the Priest (the representative of Christ) unlocks the Bible to read the Word of God.

Revelation 5:8
These are the prayers/petitions of the saints/holy ones on earth, which are offered up to God through Jesus, every Sunday, after the Priest delivers the sermon/homily.  These also include our personal petitions.\
These prayers are received by the 24 elders/priests (the Patriarchs of the 12 tribes and the 12 the Apostles) in Heaven (Psalm 141:1; Tobit 12:12).

These prayers are sent up to God because we are part of the Communion of Saints in Heaven through baptism.  We encounter many obstacles in our daily lives which make it difficult for us to accomplish our mission on earth and remain holy, due to the damaged nature of our souls and because we are still in the flesh.
These prayers include general needs of the Church community, the public authorities, the oppressed, etc., whatever could be a possible obstacle in maintaining the holiness of the Church.

Do the Saints Pray for Us?
We may infer from the fact that the saints are in heaven that they would pray for us. Being in heaven means being united with God, who is love (1 John 4:8-9, 16). When united with God, we will be transformed to be like him (Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 15:49-52; 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Pet. 1:4; 1 John 3:2), for “nothing unclean shall enter” the heavenly city (Rev. 21:27).
Being thus transformed by the love of God, the saints are filled with love and so care about others. It is natural when you care about someone to pray to God for that person. We can thus infer that, just as God loves us and provides for us, the saints love and pray for those on earth.

Revelation 5:9-10
Jesus is the new Israel and those who are baptized into His Body are priests in the kingdom of the new Israel, some common and some ordained.

*You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God.*
The duty of a priest is to serve God by offering sacrifices. While the ordained priests are permitted to offer the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the divine Son of God, we, the common priests, can offer our bodies, in union with Christ, so that God can use us for the growth of His Kingdom.

Revelation 5:11-14
In Heaven the angels and saints enjoy worshipping God continuously (Revelation 4:8) because they are in supreme communion with God, but on earth God has commanded us to worship Him in His House (the Church) at least once a week because our sinful bodies make it difficult for us to enjoy spending even one hour with God, while the same bodies will not have any problem spending endless hours with worldly distractions and worldly activities.

Then all Heaven and earth joins together with loud voices to sing with one accord the Great “Amen".  On earth we sing this Great “Amen" at the end of the Eucharistic liturgy.   Thereafter Jesus makes the atonement for our sins (Hebrews 7:25).  In Heaven there is no atonement for sins but the angels and saints rejoice while they sing along with us because we (the bride) have now been purified (covered with while robes) and made ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb (to receive Communion).

When we give a positive response to the Word of God (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ) we are swearing that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7).  Doing otherwise is disobedience and therefore sinful.

Titus 1:5-9
Paul was advising Titus to anoint more men to serve as bishops/overseers, priests/presbyters and deacons/helpers in the new Churches/Parishes.  Anointed priests and bishops would be the successors of the Apostles, ensuring that the Church's “dominion continued through all generations” (Philippians 1:1).

Paul applied the teaching of Jesus (Luke 17: 1-6) to Titus, who was Paul's spiritual child and the Bishop of Crete. Paul had instructed Titus to appoint in every town, blameless men to serve the Lord as priests, but before judging their character, Titus, as the Bishop of the Church, had to ensure that he himself was blameless, clean of character, holy and spreading the message of Christ to all.

*But why did Paul give all these instructions to Titus?*
Paul gave all these instructions to Titus because Paul knew that the Church was not going to be free of the spirit of Judas.
Paul also knew that it would be easy to find qualified men to serve as priests and bishops, but they would not be blameless men, they would be proud, arrogant, irritable, etc., and they would eventually be involved in corruption and scandals.   Therefore, Paul cautioned Titus that when he appointed bishops and priests, he must appoint men who would pursue holiness, men who would be righteous and holy spiritual fathers.

### Judgment and Repentance

[![Judgment and Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day361.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LCEln1heqP8 "Judgment and Repentance")

### Day 361: A second chance

We listened to the letter of St Paul to Philemon today and it’s a very short book it has just one chapter. Most of the chapter is written about Onesimus, St Paul is asking Philemon to give Onesimus a second chance in life.
Philemon was a wealthy Chritian and a just man. Onesimus was his slave, remember slavery wasn’t forced but mutually accepted back in the day just like our modern day job contract. Onesimus was probably a useless slave and possibly did something wrong to Philemon or did not fulfill his duties. It’s possible that Philemon sent him to jail or the Onesimus ran away and got into trouble, for our context it really does not matter.
Onesimus encountered Paul in the prison and received the gospel, he then became very helpful to Paul. In the letter to Philemon we read that Paul wanted to keep Onesimus with him as he was a great help in Paul’s old age, however Paul wanted to send him back to Philemon so Onesimus can fulfil his duty and be justified fully. Let us read the section of this letter as it’s beautifully written.

For I have experienced much joy and encouragement\* from your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed by you, brother.
Therefore, although I have the full right\* in Christ to order you to do what is proper,
I rather urge you out of love, being as I am, Paul, an old man,\* and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus. I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment, who was once useless to you but is now useful\* to \[both\] you and me.
I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.
I should have liked to retain him for myself, so that he might serve\* me on your behalf in my imprisonment for the gospel,
but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that the good you do might not be forced but voluntary.
Perhaps this is why he was away from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man\* and in the Lord.
So if you regard me as a partner, welcome him as you would me.
And if he has done you any injustice or owes you anything, charge it to me.
I, Paul, write this in my own hand: I will pay. May I not tell you that you owe me your very self.
Yes, brother, may I profit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
With trust in your compliance I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
At the same time prepare a guest room for me, for I hope to be granted to you through your prayers.   Philemon 1: 7-22
I wish and hope that everyone who needs a second chance in life finds a St Paul to lead and guide them. Also we should never write off anyone, but always know that Jesus can change their lives in ways we least expect it. Even if they are in jail like Onesimus there is still a chance that they can convert their lives, the gospel is not bound. Also we should pray for those involved in prison ministry, that they may have the patience and strength to minister to the inmates. Remember Jesus’ words in Mat 25:36 "I was in prison, and you came to me". Giving someone a second chance is really hard especially if they hurt us, we cannot rely on our own strength here but only on God’s grace. Forgiving close family members like a spouse, parent or child is extremely difficult but pray and give them a second chance not just once but 70 times 7.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

### The Woman Clothed with the Sun

[![The Woman Clothed with the Sun](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day362.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2l0Q9gjHrqk "The Woman Clothed with the Sun")

### BIAY Day 362 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 12:1
*A great sign appeared in the sky; a woman clothed with the sun.*
The woman is the Church (Ephesians 5:22-24) besieged by Satan but preserved in safety by God.
The woman is daughter Zion who brought forth Israel’s Messiah.
The woman is the new Eve (Mary).

*A woman clothed with the sun.*
The sun in John’s vision was the Holy Spirit who overshadowed Mary since the time of the incarnation (Luke 1:35) and likewise overshadows the Church.\
In the old Covenant, the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit was symbolized by covering the Ark with pure gold (Exodus 25:11).
The Ark of the old Covenant was a box.  It was a shadow of Mary and a symbol of the Church.
The Ark of the new Covenant is a woman, the Mother of our Lord.

*..... with the moon under her feet,.....*
This woman is in Heaven.
\*......... and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
This woman is the queen.
Mary and the Church are the fulfillment of the promise which God had made in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).
John does not refer to the "woman" as “soul” because she was taken to Heaven body and soul, whereas John refers to the martyrs as souls (Revelation 6:9).
When John saw this vision, Mary had already left this world, even before the destruction of the Temple in AD 70, so she was already in Heaven.

“Rahem” (in Hebrew/Aramaic) means “mercy” as well as “womb.”
God's mercy for the world came through the womb of Mary.
As commanded by God, before the Babylonian attack (Jeremiah 20:4), the Ark of the Covenant, the Tent and the Altar of incense were hidden by prophet Jeremiah in a cave and were to be revealed only after God would gather His people together and show His mercy (2 Maccabees 2:4-7).   Thereafter, the Temple was desolate because the Ark was not in the Temple (Matthew 23:38).

Revelation 12:3
The dragon is represented by the evil and corrupt rulers of the evil empires.

Revelation 12:4
These stars are the angels who obeyed Satan and followed him and were therefore all cast out of heaven.
The devil will succeed in misleading one-third of the Christians to follow him.

*One third of the stars..…*
Why only one-third ?
It is believed that one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Father, one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Son, and one-third of the angels were to worship and serve the Holy Spirit.\
All 3 groups of angels have a superior angel and Lucifer/Satan was one of them.

Angels are on a higher level than humans. They are pure spirits. They have free will but they do not have the option of repentance because they have full knowledge of everything, including the consequences of their actions. Their knowledge is not limited like humans. Therefore they can only obey or disobey and their will is irrevocable.

*Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave birth.*
Satan was waiting for a chance to destroy Jesus after his birth.
According to the prophecy of Daniel, Satan (the dragon) had some knowledge, though not exact, regarding the timeline when the Messiah would be born, and Satan was aware that he would be destroyed by the Messiah sent by God as prophesied by God (Genesis 3:15).  But being a spirit, Satan needed the body of a greedy, selfish, rich, evil and powerful ruler, who serves him, to carry out his mission.  He therefore united himself to king Herod who perfectly met Satan’s criteria, because Herod was ambitious, paranoid and so possessive with regard to the throne that he had killed his own family members (one wife and sons) who, according to Herod, were seeking to snatch the throne from him.
Satan (the dragon) also joined himself later to the evil rulers who persecuted the infant Church (the Body of Christ) and tried to destroy it, though without success.

Revelation 12:13
Satan went after the woman because he hates the new Woman. Why?
Satan succeeded in tricking the first Woman to poison the first Adam to bring eternal death to God's people, but he didn't succeed in tricking the new Woman / the new Eve and therefore she gave life to the new Adam (Jesus), who is able to give God's new people eternal life because of the new Woman / the new Eve / Mary the Mother of Jesus, and Jesus will eventually destroy Satan.

Revelation 12:14
“Great eagle” is a symbol of the power and swiftness of divine help (Psalm 91:4; Exodus 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isaiah 40:31).
God protected the infant Church during the persecution by Nero, who ruled for three and a half years.\
God also provided divine assistance when the Church went underground for three and a half centuries, the guarantee which He had given in the Old Covenant (Genesis 3:15).  In the New Covenant Jesus confirmed the guarantee of the same divine assistance (Mathew 16:18), because the celebration of the new Passover (Mass) must go on until the end of time.

Revelation 12:17
If the devil has been constantly throwing major problems in our lap then we must rejoice that we have been counted by God as worthy to be called the children of our heavenly mother Mary because she will be our mother willingly only if we are obeying her Son (John 2:5).
The dragon was angry with the woman because he did not succeed in deceiving her either before she gave birth to the Redeemer or after.
The dragon makes war on the rest of her children because Jesus gave His mother to them as their spiritual mother (John 19:26-27) to feed them, nurture them and raise them as children who are pleasing to God the Father, just as she raised her own Son (Matthew 3:17; 17:5).  This is her task as Queen Mother until the end of time.  It is her duty to form us into saints in union with her spouse, the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:31-35 & 38).

Revelation 13:1
Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with ten horns (power) and seven heads; on its horns were ten diadems (monarchy), and on its heads blasphemous names.
horns = power;
diadems = monarchy.
The first beast, symbolizing the pagan Roman empire or its evil and corrupt rulers, becomes the dragon’s agent.
Domitian, like Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Dn 7:8, 11, 25), demanded that he be called by divine titles such as “our lord and god” (blasphemous name).
Most of the Roman emperors made the same demand.\
The future first beast can be any similar evil, corrupt & powerful political authority.

Revelation 13:11
The second beast tries to look like *the Lamb* (of God) to deceive God’s people (Matthew 24:5).
The second beast arises from the land, symbolizing the anti-Christ or evil and corrupt religious authority, which leads people astray, by deception, to worship the first beast (Rev 13:11–18).
The religious authorities in the first century AD led the Jews astray by giving glory to Emperor Caesar (John 19:15).
The future second beast can be any corrupt religious authority.

Revelation 13:13
The second beast raises up false prophets who deceive the people into following their teaching by performing miracles to lure the people towards them.\
We have already been warned by Moses, Jesus and Paul to be aware and beware of the false prophets (Deut. 13:1–4; Mathew 24:24; 2 Thess. 2:9–10).

Revelation 13:18
666, refers to humanity, created on the sixth day and brought into covenant with God on the seventh day, which God blessed as the Sabbath.
The early Christians referred to the evil and cruel emperors as the “anti-Christs” (1 John 2:18-22; 4:3; 2 John 1:7) therefore John had to be careful when referring to any of them.
Caesar Nero was one of the emperors who viciously persecuted the Church. Christians had either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom.  Peter and Paul were executed during the rule of Nero, before the destruction of the Temple.
The consonants in Nero's name add up to 666.\
The only other time the number 666 appears in the Bible is when Solomon turned away from God and started multiplying his wealth, women and weapons (1 Kings 10:14).
Therefore the final beast would probably be a combination of Solomon and Nero; In other words, the final beast (or anti-Christ) would be an evil, rich, womanizing, powerful and cruel ruler who will viciously persecute the Christians.

The number 666 is what “Nero Caesar” (NRWN QSR) adds up to in Hebrew and Aramaic according to the numerical values the letters have in these languages (N+R+W+N+Q+S+R = 50+200+6+50+100+60+200 = 666).

However, as long as we receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27) every Sunday and obey God’s commandments at all times, we will be covered by the Blood of the Lamb and Satan will not be able to destroy our souls, even if he succeeds in destroying our bodies.
Therefore let us stop worrying about the anti-Christ and focus more on the living Christ.

Revelation 14:1
In the old Covenant, the ordained Jewish priests had only the Father's name on their foreheads (Exodus 28:36-38; Exodus 29:6).
In the new Covenant, the Christian priests have the Father's and Son's name on their foreheads by virtue of their baptism.

Revelation 14:4-5
*It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins;*
These are the celibate priests who served God faithfully without getting involved with idolatory of any kind.  Therefore they were pure in body and soul.

*............ these follow the Lamb wherever he goes.*
They followed the Passover Lamb (Jesus) because wherever there is a Tabernacle there is an Apostolic priest.

*........... and in their mouth no lie was found; they are blameless.*
These are the godly priests who have abstained from women and who have preached the true Word of God and brought many people close to God (Malachi 2:4-7).

Revelation 14:12
In addition to faith in Jesus, Jesus insists upon the necessity and value of “good works” and obedience to God’s commandments even in the face of a crisis or any negative situation (Revelation 2:23; 20:12–13; 22:12; Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6).

Revelation 14:13
“Yes,” said the Spirit, “let them find rest from their labors, for their works accompany them.”
We will be judged by our faith and works, and when we enter into God's eternal rest we will rest from our works, because "entering into God's rest" means "our faith has been tested and we have proved our faith by our works" (Hebrews 4:10).

Hebrews 1:14
Christ is the centre of the angelic world.  They are His angels (Matthew 25:31).
They belong to Him because they were created through and for Him (Colossians 1:16) and specially because he has made them the messengers of his saving plan.

In the old Covenant, angels have been present since the beginning of creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from far or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan:

1. they closed the earthly paradise (Genesis 3:24);
2. they protected Lot (Genesis 19:15);
3. they saved Hagar and her child (Genesis 21:17);
4. they stayed Abraham's hand (Genesis 22:11);
5. they communicated the law by their ministry (Acts 7:53);
6. they led the People of God (Exodus 23:20-22);
7. they announced births and callings (Judges 13:3; 6:11-24);
8. they assisted the prophets (Isaiah 6:6; 1 Kings 19:5);
9. Angel Gabriel announced the birth of the fore runner and of Jesus Himself (Luke 1:11 & 26).

In the new Covenant, from the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate (Jesus) is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels:

1. When God "brought the firstborn into the world, He said, “Let all God's angels worship Him” (Hebrews 1:6.); thereafter their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise, "Glory to God in the highest" (Luke 2:14);
2. They saved Jesus and His mother from being deserted by Joseph (Matthew 1:20).
3. They protected Jesus in his infancy (Matthew 2:13 & 19-20);
4. They served him in the desert (Matthew 4:11; Mark 1:13);
5. They strengthened him while He was going through agony in the garden (Luke 22:43), when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies (Matthew 26:53) as Israel had been saved (2 Maccabees 10:29-30; 11:8).
6. It was the angels who "evangelized" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection (Luke 2:8-14; Mark 16:5-7).
   They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his Judgement (Matthew 13:41-42; 24:31; Luke 12:8-9; Acts 1:10-11).
   (CCC 331-336)

Hebrews 3:7-8
Whenever we harden our hearts (resist God by committing sins), like those Israelites,  we break the Covenant with God and automatically move into a Covenant with Satan.  God is calling us to repent and renew our Covenant with Him regularly so that we can be in a Covenant relation with Him (state of grace) every day, and if we die today we can directly enter into our eternal rest.
God lives outside of time, so for Him the Covenant was made through Jesus “today” and we belong to His Covenant family through baptism.

The two most important moments in our lives are:
(1) now, and
(2) at the hour of our death.

Let us therefore focus on God's Will and obey His commandments every moment of our present time so that we may remain strong in our faith until the hour of our death.

Hebrews 4:1-8
Here the author speaks of two types of spiritual rests.

One rest is when God rested on the seventh day from all His works after the creation of the world, and God invited humanity to join Him in that rest every Sabbath as a symbol of their eternal rest.

The second rest is the rest of the earthly promised land, which was a symbol of our heavenly promised land.  The earthly promised land was a physical place where the people could enter and have peace and safety if they obeyed God.  But the people of Israel sinned terribly, generation after generation, starting from the first generation of adults who passed through the Red Sea.  The Israelites never fully embraced the Covenant laws and therefore never enjoyed the promised peace and rest.

Like the Israelites, we too have been promised that same peace and rest till we reach our heavenly promised land if we obey God’s commandments and the teachings of Christ.  But we are on a better level than those ancient people, because in baptism Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit to help us enjoy that peace and rest on earth without struggling with our human efforts.  We just need to detach ourselves from the world, surrender ourselves to the Lord, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and spend moments of silence in solitude with the Holy Spirit without resisting the working of the Spirit in our lives so that we can have that peaceful relationship with God, the same bliss which was enjoyed by Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden before the fall.

Hebrews 4:9-10
The seventh day Sabbath rest (Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8-9) was to be a shadow of the Eternal rest for God’s people (Hebrews 4:9).  In the old Covenant it was Saturday, whereas in the new Covenant it is Sunday.

After completing His work of the first creation, God rested on the seventh day of the week (the Sabbath), blessed it and made it holy (Genesis 2:2-3).  It was supposed to be an everlasting Sabbath until sin entered the world.
Therefore, after the completion of His work for the salvation of mankind, Jesus (the first Adam) rested in the tomb on Holy Saturday, the seventh day of the week, in accordance with the Jewish Sabbath.\
His Sabbath rest indicated the end of the first / old creation.
The Resurrection of Jesus (the new Adam) on the first day of the week was the beginning of the new creation which has no end.
(CCC 624)

### The New Covenant Priesthood

[![The New Covenant Priesthood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day363.jpg)](https://youtu.be/oX1MJT0iXpc "The New Covenant Priesthood")

### BIAY Day 363 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 15:2
*And I saw......... those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name.*

Those who had conquered the beast were the martyrs.
The martyrs are shown as victorious even though the beast succeeded in killing them on earth because the beast succeeded in destroying their bodies but not their souls.  The beast wanted them to deny Jesus / disobey God to save their bodies but they refused until their death.
Spiritual victory is not the same as physical victory.

Revelation 16:1-17
The seven angels poured the wine of God’s fury as destructive libations on those who rejected the Blood of the Covenant (the Blood of Christ), as opposed to the atoning libations (the Blood of Christ) offered to God during Mass by the priests.

In the New Covenant, as in the Old, God has given us a choice between eternal life and eternal death.  To reject the Blood of the new Covenant (the Blood of Christ) is to choose death (Hebrews 10:29).

During every Mass, when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution, “this is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant” we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse.\
During every Mass, we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass, we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Revelation 16:14
*These were demonic spirits who performed signs. They went out to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for the battle on the great day of God the almighty.*

The evil spirits will go out into the world to prepare the kings for world war.  But simultaneously, there is also a spiritual war going on in the spiritual realm between the good spirits and the evil spirits (Revelation 12:7) which is reflected by war on the earth between humans.

At the beginning of the Bible, after Adam and Eve chose to make a Covenant with Satan, Satan used one man (Cain) to kill his own brother, which was the result of pride.

At the end if the Bible Satan has succeeded in stirring up the pride of billions of humans to kill each other.

Instead of using money to feed the poor and needy, pride has led humans to use that same money to buy weapons to kill each other.
When man has too many material conditions for happiness, he multiplies wars.

Revelation 17:1 & 15
*The great harlot who lives near the many waters.*
The “great harlot” could have been pagan Rome, who led people astray into idolatry and immoral lifestyle, the population of Rome being a mixture of many nationalities (many waters).

Revelation 17:2
*The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the inhabitants of the earth became drunk on the wine of her harlotry.*
The pagan kings of Israel (example: Herod), subject to pagan Rome, adopted the cult of the emperors and led the people of Israel astray into idolatry and immoral lifestyle.  Therefore Jerusalem and Judah were also referred to as a “harlot” (Ezekiel 16:2-63; Jeremiah 2:20; 3:3; Isaiah 1:21).

Revelation 17:6
*The woman was drunk on the blood of the holy ones and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.*
Persecution of the Apostles and the faithful Christians by the Romans.

Revelation 17:9-10
*The seven heads represent seven hills upon which the woman is seated. They also represent seven kings. Five have already fallen, one still lives, and the last has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a short while.*
Rome is only one of the cities in the world which sits on seven hills but so does Athens, Jerusalem, San Francisco and Cincinnati.

Rome is built on seven hills. During the time of John, the currency coins used by pagan Rome were embossed with a lady sitting on seven hills, so the first century Jewish Christians knew exactly who John was referring to.

According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the five kings who had fallen were the deceased emperors of the Caesarean dynasty of Rome (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius I, Caligula and Claudius).  Emperor Nero Caesar, the sixth, was the one who was ruling (AD 54 to 68).   The next emperor, who was not yet crowned, would be Galba, the seventh one, who would last for only one year (AD 68 to 69).

Hebrews 5:1-4
This law applies to all priests of the old as well as the new Covenants.
Much emphasis is put on the High Priest because the letters to the Hebrews were written when the High Priest of the old Covenant was still functioning in the Jerusalem Temple even after the old priesthood was handed over to Jesus and the new priesthood had started functioning in the Church.
The High Priest of the old Covenant was therefore, at that point, a religious danger to the Jewish Christians who were confused between the two priesthoods. Due to this confusion the Jewish Christians continued following the Mosaic law faithfully and offering animal sacrifices while they also attended the liturgical services in the Church and offered the sacrifice of the Lamb of God.

Thus, they were taking part in the sacrificial meals of the Temple as well as of the Church.

A Priest does not take on his priestly role by choice, but only when called by God (John 15:16).  Although all Christian men are called to be common priests, God calls certain men from among them for His special divine mission.  However, our first universal calling happens when we are called by God to the grace of faith to receive the sacrament of Baptism.  The calling for Priesthood is the second calling of selected men who must receive another sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders.

Just as Aaron, in the old Covenant, did not take the honor upon himself when he was appointed by God to be the earthly High Priest, similarly, Christ neither appointed Himself nor did He exalt Himself when He was appointed by God to be the heavenly High Priest, because that was a calling from God, not the choice of Jesus.\
The author of Hebrews was explaining to the people how it was possible for Jesus to be designated as a heavenly High Priest even though He did not meet any of the criteria of an earthly High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16).

Every High Priest has the principal function of acting as a sacrificial mediator between God and His people.   The role of the High Priest is:
a)  to act on behalf of God’s people,
b)  to speak to God on behalf of God’s people,
c)  to plead for forgiveness from God on behalf of God’s people, and.\
d)  to offer sacrifices on behalf of God’s people in atonement for their sins, which is meant to reconcile God’s people to God.
The earthly High Priest was able to understand / sympathize with the people because he himself was subject to weakness of the soul (a sinner) like God’s people.  Therefore, the High Priest was above the people in his role as mediator, but he was also part of the same people as a sinner.

In the old Covenant, the ordained priest offered the sacrifice of an earthly lamb on behalf of the consecrated common priests (the congregation) who took part in the worship in union with the ordained priest and thereafter they shared in the sacrificial meal (the earthly lamb) for their physical nourishment.
In the new Covenant, the ordained priest offers the sacrifice of the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) on behalf of the baptismal common priests (the congregation) who take part in the worship in union with the ordained priest and thereafter they share in the heavenly sacrificial meal (the Bread of eternal life / Communion) for their spiritual nourishment.

God wanted Israel to be a nation of common priests (Exodus 19:6) but this didn’t happen in the new Covenant because majority of Israel rejected Jesus.

By virtue of their baptism, Christians have a share in Christ’s common priesthood
This is commonly referred to as “the common priesthood of all the faithful.”
However, certain members of the faithful are ordained to a greater participation in Christ’s priesthood to serve as ministerial priests / by the Sacrament of Holy Orders. This is known as the ministerial priesthood.
Christ, the source of the common and ministerial priesthoods, is our High Priest

The Church thus understands there to be a threefold structure of the priesthood:

1. the common priesthood of all Christians (1 Peter 2:9);
2. the ministerial priesthood of the ordained (Romans 15:16; Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:5; James 5:14); and
3. the high priesthood of Christ (Hebrews 3:1, 4:14–15, 5:5, 6:20, and 9:11).
   It was the same pattern in the Old Covenant.
   There was a common priesthood of the Israelites made up of the head of every household, a ministerial priesthood from the sons of Aaron (Exod. 28:1), with Aaron as the high priest (Ezra 7:5).

The ordained ministry or the ministerial priesthood is at the service of the baptismal priesthood.  Christ the Lord, High Priest who was taken from among men, (Heb. 5:1-5) made the new people (the Christians) "a kingdom of common priests to God the Father" (Rev. 6:1; 5:9-10).

Hebrews 5:5-6
*Christ was appointed by the One who said to him, “You are my Son, today I have begotten you”; as he says also in another place, “You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”*

To be God's son is to be a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. That is why only men are called to be the anointed/ordained priests. And that is why Jesus chose only men to be His Apostles, His future priests, even though He had many female disciples.

To be a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek means to have a clean priesthood where there is no bloodshed, and to offer bread and wine to God in thanksgiving.
It is the same in the New Covenant.

In between, the Levitical priesthood was a priesthood where the offerings involved a lot of bloodshed (of animals) because of the sin of the Golden Calf.
But Melchizedek’s offering was an incomplete offering.
Jesus became a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, in the Upper Room, when He made a complete offering of bread and wine in thanksgiving as well as in atonement for the sins of God’s people.

Hebrews 7:23-24
*The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but Jesus holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.*

How does the priesthood of Jesus remain forever ?

When the New Covenant priests repeat the words of consecration, Jesus takes the gifts/offerings (bread and wine) from the earthly priests, transforms them into His Body and Blood and offers them to God the Father in the Holy of Holies (Holy Sanctuary), in atonement for the sins of the Priest and his congregation (Hebrews 7:25).  Thereafter God the Father blesses the gifts/offerings and returns them to the Priest as the resurrected Body of Christ (the new Passover Lamb) which the people must consume as their sacrificial meal (Communion).  Thus, with His holy and acceptable offering Jesus, the High Priest, is able to purify the worshipers and bring them closer to God.

And as long as there are priests on earth, Jesus will be performing His priestly duty by continually offering Himself to the Father, to purify God’s people and bring them closer to God.  Therefore the celebration of the Eucharist (Mass) must go on until the end of time (Exodus 12:14, 17 & 24).

Hebrews 7:25
*Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.*
Jesus intercedes for us continuously by offering the sacramental sacrifice in Heaven whenever it is offered on the earth, the same sacrifice which He offered in the Upper Room.

When does Jesus make this intercession for us?
Jesus intercedes for us during the Mass and even when we generally pray to God through Jesus, outside the Mass.

Hebrews 8:12
God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

### Christ's Sacrifice Once for All

[![Christ's Sacrifice Once for All](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day364.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Uj16LVInOE4 "Christ's Sacrifice Once for All")

### BIAY Day 364 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 18:4
*Then I heard another voice from heaven say, “Depart from her, my people, so as not to take part in her sins and receive a share in her plagues.”*

This is a command for God’s people to separate themselves from the sinners, and not for evacuation of the city.
God wanted the faithful Christians to leave Rome for their safety and also so that they do not fall into sin by following the pagan worship and lifestyle.  Because of the severe persecution of the Christians during this time, the Christians fled from Rome, settled in other countries around Rome and started evangelizing the people there. Thus Christianity spread to the whole of Europe.

God allowed the persecution to move the Christians from their comfort zones and do their duty of evangelizing the world, which would not have happened if they continued to live comfortably in Rome.

This can happen to anyone of us if God wants us to go on a mission to places we would never have thought of.

When the Christians moved out, Rome was then left with only the wicked ones who brought destruction on themselves.

Revelation 18:8
*Therefore, her plagues will come in one day, pestilence, grief, and famine; she will be consumed by fire.  For mighty is the Lord God who judges her.*

The Babylon referred to in this chapter could be Jerusalem (as some scholars believe), because Rome had completely destroyed Jerusalem by burning the city, in 70 AD, and according to the book of Ezekiel, the curse of the Covenant was to come upon Jerusalem.  We see the curse fulfilled in this book with famine, pestilence, strife (Revelation 6:2-8) and the seven angelic trumpets.\
These calamities, which took place during the destruction of the Temple, were recorded by Josephus (the Jewish historian).\
During this time not a single Christian perished because they had fled to the mountains across Jordan to a place called Pella, as commanded by Jesus (Mathew 24:15-16).

After the destruction of the Temple, a few houses and the Upper Room had, however, survived the destruction, and around 130 AD, as reported by St. Epiphanius, the Christians who returned to Jerusalem later, continued celebrating the new Passover / Eucharist in the Upper Room.
Why did God preserve the Upper Room ?
According to Tradition, this was the place where Jesus had instituted the Eucharist, and the spot where the Holy Spirit had descended on the Apostles, Mary and the other disciples, on Pentecost Sunday.  It was the place where the first Christians were nourished during the spiritual famine, and where they were sealed by the Spirit for safety in the forthcoming destruction.  The Upper Room is situated on Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, which was the capital city of the earthly Davidic kingdom.

Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6.
Hallel-u-yah means "Praise the Lord."
This frequent exclamation of praise in the Hebrew Psalms was important in Jewish liturgy and has been adopted by the Church as well.

Revelation 19:7-9
*Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory, for the wedding day of the Lamb has come, his bride has made herself ready. She was allowed to wear a bright, clean linen garment.”  (The linen represents the righteous deeds of the holy ones.)  Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage feast of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These words are true; they come from God.”*
During the liturgical service of the new Passover / Mass, through the power of the Holy Spirit, atonement has been made by Jesus (Hebrews 7:25), on behalf of His priests, for the forgiven sins of the bride of Christ (the Priest and the congregation) and thus she has purified herself and made herself ready for the marriage feast of the Lamb.  Her good works go along with her.

The spotless bride (the community of saints) is, therefore, now being invited to take part in the marriage feast of the Lamb, to unite with her Groom (Jesus) by receiving the Body of Christ (John 6:54) since she is already in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).\
At this point the priest raises the living Body of Christ and officially invites the purified congregation to share in the heavenly meal, by saying:
"Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29), Blessed are those who have been called to the supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:9)."
This is the climax of the worship.

The words of invitation (Revelation 19:9) come from God through His anointed priests.
Our earthly marriages reflect the spiritual marriage between Jesus and His bride.  We must, therefore, always respect the sanctity of marriage (Hebrews 13:4).

The nuptial union takes place when we receive the Body of Christ (our heavenly Groom) on our tongue and therefore we surrender and subject ourselves to Him (Ephesians 5:22-24).  The bride (the community of saints) must, therefore, always go forward to the Altar, with humility, to receive her groom (Jesus).

When Jesus comes at the end of time, the saints of the Church will be going marching with Him to Heaven, in the same manner, to receive Him in person and take part in the heavenly wedding feast in Heaven.

Thus, the Bible begins in Genesis with a marriage between Adam (the son of God) and his bride (Eve), and ends in Revelation with a marriage between Jesus (the Son of God) and His bride (the new Eve / Mary and the saints of the Church).

Revelation 19:15
*Out of his mouth came a sharp sword to strike the nations.*
Jesus will conquer the nations by preaching the Word of God.  It is a heavenly weapon, not an earthly one.  Therefore, the sword is not in His hand but in His mouth.

Revelation 20:1-4
*Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain.  He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended.*
The binding of Satan’s army started when Jesus, during His Ministry, started releasing the people of the bigger demons which no one could bind (Matthew 12:29; Mark 3:27).\
By His crucifixion and death, Jesus finally destroyed the power of Satan over humanity (locked Satan inside the pit).  The saving power of Jesus, however, applies to us only when we are baptized and, thereafter, Jesus protects us from Satan when we receive the sacraments (1 John 5:18; Mark 3:27; John 12:31-32).
That is why, whenever we release Satan from the lockup with our mortal sins, we need the sacraments to release our souls from his clutches.

On the other hand, when Christians live in total obedience to God they contribute to the sanctification of the world and the glorification of God (Matthew 5:16).

Hebrews 9:11-12\
In Christ’s fulfillment of the Old Covenant sacrifices, Jesus’s sacrifice didn’t begin and end on Calvary, nor did it end with his glorious Resurrection, which is why He told Mary Magdalene not to cling to Him because He had not yet ascended to his Father in heaven (John 20:17), to complete the sacrificial ritual.  There was something more for Jesus to do to complete His one sacrifice.

Unlike the earthly high priests, Jesus ascended to a Heavenly Sanctuary, not made by hands, and brought His own sinless blood to God to obtain eternal redemption once for all (Hebrews 9:11-12), to appear in the presence of God and reconcile the people to God, and thereafter celebrate the Day of Atonement of the new Covenant with the angels and saints in the true Holy of Holies, thereby terminating the Day of Atonement of the Old Covenant.  Thus the one-time sacrifice of Jesus, which started in the Upper Room, was completed only in the Heavenly Sanctuary after His Ascension.

Hebrews 9:22
*According to the law almost everything is purified by blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.*
Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins because sin is in our blood.
The duty of a priest is therefore to reconcile sinners to God by pouring out the divine blood (the consecrated wine) which was given to us to make atonement for our sins (Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:25).
When we break our Covenant with God, it is not enough to say “sorry” and close the chapter.  We must offer holy blood to God to repair the damage and the only blood acceptable to God is the Blood of Christ.

If sin is debt then the Blood of Christ is credit.
Jesus paid a debt He did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay.
This verse is written in the present tense because it is valid until the end of time.

Hebrews 10:9-10
*He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.  And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.*

In the old Covenant, the earthly lambs had to be slaughtered and offered daily or monthly or yearly because, although those lambs were without physical blemish, they died after being slaughtered.  Therefore, the priests and their congregation could not receive divine life after eating the sacrificial meals.

But that was just a shadow of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) was slaughtered only once but this Lamb still lives and will live on forever even after being slaughtered because He was without spiritual blemish (sin). Therefore, the priests and their congregations can receive divine life after offering His body and blood and eating the sacrificial meal (the Body of Christ / Communion).

*And it is by God’s will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.*
The sacrifice of Jesus is like comprehensive insurance for our souls.  Jesus has paid the advance price with His Blood therefore we don’t have to pay the price with our blood.  So now whenever we become sick (with sins) we can go to our spiritual doctor (the priest) and tell him our symptoms (confession) and he will advise some lifestyle changes (penance).  Thereafter, he will prepare the medicine (atonement with the Blood of Christ) so that our souls may be healed (purified).

Proverbs 31:28a
*Her children rise up and call her blessed.*
The godly woman described here is a mature mother of older children. “Her children rise up and call her blessed”.  They recognize what a great job she has done.

*For what do they bless her?*

*The children bless their mother for raising godly children in an ungodly world.*
The true charm of this woman is her religious spirit and fear of God.
Proverbs was written during a different time in history and in a different land, yet we face similar challenges with marriage and family life.
During a much earlier period of history, Noah faced these challenges of an ungodly culture (Genesis 6:5, 11). God was ready to destroy everything, but Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man, blameless in his generation (Genesis 6:8, 9). God had a plan to save him and his entire family. Noah’s wife believed God’s Word through her husband; she trusted his leadership. Together Noah and she had raised sons who also believed God’s Word through their father and helped him build the Ark. In that godless culture they chose wives who followed their lead, believing God’s Word through Noah. There was no spiritual leader to ask for advise, and there was no Bible to refer to.
Building the Ark was no simple task; it took decades. They had to gather the animals and supplies manually.  People may have definitely mocked Noah and his family for believing and obeying God's Word.
The same is true even today, and like Noah, we may also be mocked for trying to raise godly children in an ungodly world.
We need to follow Noah’s example.
Husbands need to lead their families;
Wives need to trust the Lord to work through the spiritual leadership of their husbands;
Parents need to teach and help their children to pursue holiness, irrespective of their age, including choosing godly spouses for them;
And our families need to remain in the Ark of the Church (the barque of Peter), so that we are preserved from the floodwaters of wickedness that surround us.
Finally, we thank God for the salvation he has graciously provided, praying that others will open their hearts to the same grace.

*They bless their mother for their good family name.*
She contributes to a legacy:
"The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot" (Proverbs 10:7).
When a woman marries, she takes her husband’s family name as an expression of unity. She then contributes to the positive reputation of that name. The couple then gives their family name to their children and expects them to also contribute to the honor of the family name.
“A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold” (Proverbs 22:1).

*They bless their mother for her obedience of faith.*
As parents, our obedience or disobedience has a generational impact (Exodus20:5–6).
Likewise, our marriage is an ongoing source of strength for our children as they move from childhood to adulthood. Christian husbands and wives are “joint heirs of the grace of life” (1 Peter 3:7). How we conduct ourselves in the vocation of marriage authenticates what we believe, especially in our expanding family. Imagine the gratitude of our adult children as they enter this vocation and discover its richness but also its challenges. How grateful they will be for our faithfulness!

*They bless their mother for her prayers for them.*
We pray for our adult children to be close to us emotionally and spiritually even when they are not close to us geographically. Time and space are our boundaries, not God’s. When older children live elsewhere, we can feel scattered. We gather them in our prayers, offering our Masses and rosaries for them and uniting our fasting and little mortifications with our petitions.
We imitate Jesus by interceding for our children, just as he lives to intercede for us (Hebrews 7:25).

We pray for our children’s safety from physical and spiritual harm, just as Job did. He rose early, every day, to pray for his adult children, that they might not sin grievously against the Lord (Job 1:5). His prayers formed a hedge of protection that only God could allow Satan to breach (Job 1:10).

We pray for a godly spouse from a godly family for each child called to marriage. It is not enough to raise a godly child; whom they marry is also critical. We also pray for the whole family into which our child will marry.
The parents who formed the spouses of our children will be ongoing influences. We pray that they will strengthen the couple and support them as they become parents themselves.

### The Beginning and the End

[![The Beginning and the End](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day365.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4B60Ji4y6hg "The Beginning and the End")

### BIAY Day 365 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 21:1
The “new heavens and the new earth” represent the transformed universe.  Just as our bodies will be the same bodies which we have now, but transformed after our resurrection, so also the new heavens and new earth will be the same heavens and earth, but transformed, that is, restored to their original sanctified form before the fall.  Our bodies and the universe will both be too glorious to be imagined with our current human brains.

Creation has not been redeemed yet. As of now only our souls have been redeemed (Romans 8:23), through baptism.  After our baptism, when we (Christians) live in total obedience to God we contribute to the sanctification of the world and the glorification of God (Matthew 5:16).  That is why Jesus gave us the sacraments so that our souls can survive spiritually in this fallen world (1 John 5:18) while we transform the world through our obedience to God, because without Jesus (the sacrament) we are nothing (John 15:5).

Revelation 21:3-4
*“Behold, God’s dwelling is with the human race.  He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will always be with them as their God.  He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away.”*

“God’s dwelling” means “Tabernacle” (Leviticus 26:11; Ezekial 37:27; Exodus 29:45) the place where God dwelt with His people in the Old Covenant (Exodus 40:34).\
This ancient promise given by God through the prophets, is fulfilled through the Church (Jeremiah 24:7; 31:33; 32:38; Ezekial 11:20; 14:11; 37:23 & 27; Zechariah 8:8; Isaiah 25:8; 35:10).

In the New Covenant, God dwells with us (Emmanuel) in the “Tabernacle” in Church, and within us, as God-man, when we receive the Body of Christ / Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace.  But God’s ancient promise will be effective only if we continue leading holy lives.

The old creation could not give the people peace and happiness on earth and eternal life because the Old Covenant was not renewable and, due to the original sin, the power of evil was greater than good.

In the new creation, however, we have received a New Covenant which is renewable through the Sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) (John 20:21-23) and the Eucharist (Communion), and through our Baptism we have received the peace of Christ, therefore we can now have eternal life.  But the baptized ones can be happy only if they detach themselves from this world and rejoice in their sufferings.
In God’s Church, the “old order” of death has passed away.

Revelation 21:5
*The one who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.”*

This is not a future event.  This is a present event.  God will not make new things but He will make the existing things new by reviving the dead creation when we are baptized (2 Corinthians 5:17).

After going through the waters of the Red Sea, although the people of the old Covenant roamed in the wilderness, they actually belonged to a physical homeland (Israel) which they had not seen.

Similarly, after we are baptized, we, the people of the new Covenant, live physically in this world (the wilderness) but we do not belong to this world.  We belong to our homeland (Heaven) which we have not yet seen.  It is our homeland because we are now children of our Father in Heaven by virtue of our baptism.

Creation awaits restoration through the baptism of all humanity (Romans 8:19-23) and the reception of the Sacraments.  Therefore, by leading holy lives we must be an example for the unbelievers so that they too may believe and come into God's kingdom (Matthew 5:16).

Revelation 21:6
*It is accomplished.*
God’s reign on earth, as God-man, already began when Jesus offered Himself on the Cross to complete the liturgical procedure of the Passover of the new Covenant (John 19:30).

*To the thirsty I will give a gift from the spring of life-giving water.*
The water of baptism will be given to those who desire or thirst for it.

Revelation 21:7
*The victor will inherit these gifts, and I shall be his God, and he will be my son.*
The victor is the Christian who overcomes the forces of evil, holds fast to the faith and does God’s Will even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations.  The victorious Christian enjoys divine affiliation by adoption, the promise made to the Churches (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; & 3:5, 12, 21; Galatians 4:4–7; Rom 8:14–17).

Revelation 21:10
*He took me in spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from God.*

John was now in Heaven in spirit, therefore he was shown the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the Kingdom of God in Heaven.  The new earthly Jerusalem is a replica of the heavenly Jerusalem in spirit, because when we take part in the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), after we are purified through the Penitential Rite (Revelation 2 & 3) our spirits join the angels and saints in Heaven in their ongoing liturgy to worship God (Revelation 4:2) while our bodies are still on earth.  Consequently, the words of the Lord’s prayer *"may Thy kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven"* are nowhere more profoundly fulfilled than during the celebration of the (the Mass), because, during this celebration, Heaven and earth are united in the most perfect way.

Revelation 21:12
*The Holy City had a massive, high wall, with twelve gates.*
A city with high walls and gates resembles a sheepfold and is a metaphor for the Church.\
The heavenly Jerusalem has high spiritual walls to keep Satan out of its boundaries.
Similarly, like the sheepfold, the high spiritual walls of the Church on earth protect the Christians from predators/Satan.  The high spiritual walls in a Church become stronger with the holiness of God's people.  Like the sheep in a sheepfold, we are safe only as long as we are spiritually inside the Church, that is, if we lead holy lives. We can either be inside the Church or outside it.  We cannot be lukewarm.
The good Shepherd (Jesus) will not allow any predator (Satan) to enter the sheepfold (Church) and snatch the sheep (holy souls) which belong to the Shepherd.

Revelation 21:22
*I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.*
In the new Jerusalem, the Temple/Church is where the Body of Christ (Eucharist) is because the Body of Christ is the Church/Temple (John 2:21).\
In partaking of the Eucharistic meal, people became what they receive “the Body of Christ” / the Church.  Hence, the Church is the Eucharist.

Revelation 21:27
*Nothing unclean will enter it (the holy city Jerusalem), nor anyone who does abominable things or tells lies. Only those will enter whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.*

At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and eat from the forbidden Tree, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).

Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:22), so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.

But the decree forbidding humanity to eat the fruit from the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:22) has been revoked by Christ, therefore, now the children of Adam & Eve, who are born again through Baptism, have been given the privilege of being in a state of grace through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (John 20:23) so that they can eat the fruit (the Body of Christ / Communion) from the Tree of Life (the Cross) and receive divine life so that Jesus can raise them up on the last day (John 6:54).

Jesus has thus brought us back to God's original plan by preparing us for Eternal Life in the new Passover (Liturgy of the Mass), so that we can enter the Kingdom of God in Heaven whenever we die, and live forever with Christ.

Revelation 22:1-2
*Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city.*
This is a Trinitarian image where the throne of God is the presence of God the Father, the throne of the Lamb is the presence of God the Son and the river of the water of life is the presence of the Holy Spirit.  It is the same river of living water which Jesus promised us according to the Gospel (John 7:37-39).

*On either side of the river grew the Tree of Life.*
The tree of life had disappeared from salvation history after the fall of man (in the book of Genesis), but we now have access to it (in the book of Revelation) at the end of the Bible because we are now in the eighth and final stage of the journey of salvation.

Revelation 22:3
*The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.*
To know how to worship God in Heaven the way He wants us to, we must practice worshipping Him on earth, through a liturgy (the Mass), by following how the Apostles worshipped God.\
In Heaven there is no training center. The Kingdom of God on earth (the Church) is the training center.  We must therefore attend Mass every Sunday and remain in a state of grace at all times.

Hebrews 11:1
Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will surely happen.  It gives us assurance about things we cannot see.

Faith helps us to trust in God's power and providence and to believe that nothing can harm us without God's permission.  Faith enables us to see the invisible realities that surpass the visible ones and to look forward to the eternal rewards which outweigh the temporal sufferings.

Hope is the confident desire of obtaining a future good that is difficult to attain. It is therefore a desire which implies seeking and pursuing some future good that is not yet possessed but wanted.  This future good draws out a person's volition. Hope is confident that what is desired will certainly be attained.  Hope recognizes that the object wanted is not easily obtained and therefore requires effort to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way.

We enter the Church with faith in the resurrection of Jesus and we remain in the Church with faith in the sacraments.  The risen Christ was seen by hundreds of people but the living body of Jesus in the sacraments has not been seen by any human till today.  It is total faith that God will keep His promise and grant us eternal life if we obey His commandments and receive the relevant sacraments regularly.

Hebrews 11:32-40
Through all their afflictions the people experienced one thing in common and that was the presence of God, His comfort and His strength.

Hebrews 12:1-2
*Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us and persevere in running the race that lies before us while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfecter of faith.*
The “cloud of witnesses” are the saints referred to in Hebrews 11.  Christian life is to be inspired not only by the Old Testament saints but above all by Jesus. As the architect of Christian faith, Jesus had himself to endure the Cross before receiving the glory of His triumph (Hebrews 12:2). Reflection on His sufferings should give His followers courage to continue the struggle, if necessary, even to the shedding of blood (Hebrews 12:3–4).

Hebrews 12:5-6
*You have also forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons: “My son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord or lose heart when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines; he scourges every son he acknowledges.”*
After baptism we still incur a debt for post baptismal sins.
As an act of charity we can apply our sufferings as penance for the sins of others to reduce or remove any impediments to their holiness but our charity, however, does not contribute to the growth of holiness of others.

Hebrews 12:14
*Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.*
We become holy by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly.  We maintain our holiness by reading the Scriptures and obeying the teachings of Christ.

We cannot enter Heaven unless we are as holy as Jesus in His humanity, but we cannot reach the same level of holiness as Jesus due to the weakness of our souls.
However, if we have made sincere efforts to live in obedience to God, led a humble life, died in friendship with Christ (with sanctifying grace), then we will have to remain in Purgatory for a while for our final purification (1 Corinthians 3:11-15).

Hebrews 12:16 (also Genesis 25:29)
*See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person, who sold his birthright for a single meal.*\
Birthright was a symbol of salvation which was to be handed down to the son.\
Let us make sure that we don't sell our birthright (salvation) for a bowl of comfort or a few coins that cannot give us eternal life.
If we die rejecting God, we will lose our inheritance in heaven forever.

Hebrews 12:18-19
*You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.*
This was the scenario at Mount Sinai, in the old Covenant, when God appeared to Moses and spoke to him, and the people could not bear the presence of God (Exodus 20:18-19).  But that was due to the absence of sanctifying graces within their souls.\
It is the same reason why no human on earth can see the face of God and live.  It is the same reason why those in Hell will burn forever because God’s glory extends even upto Hell.  It is like standing in front of the sun, even if we were ten kilometers away from the sun.  Due to Adam & Eve’s sin we, on earth, do not have the power to withstand that heat.

The author was consoling the people that they were now in a much higher position than the people of the old Covenant.
In the new Covenant, when we are baptized, we receive sanctifying graces which perfect our souls.  But the graces remain within our souls only until we break the Covenant by committing a mortal sin.  Due to the weakness of our souls, the Covenant must therefore be renewed regularly by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist so that we remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times and continue receiving sanctifying graces.

Hebrews 12:22-24
*But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.*
The "assembly of the firstborn" is the Church on earth (the congregations who gather together to celebrate the Passover feast / the Mass) and the "spirits of the righteous made perfect" are the saints in Heaven, both together making up the entire Body of Christ, the Church, with an emphasis on the heavenly component, which is the source of our power.
While on earth we have bodies with spirits/souls, without which the body would decay. Saints in heaven are only spirits. God has perfected them because they were righteous when they left the earth.

When we (the assembly of the firstborn) gather together in Church (Mount Zion) to celebrate the new Passover / Mass, we join the angels and saints (spirits of the righteous made perfect) in worshipping God by singing their perpetual hymn (holy, holy, holy, ……..) (Revelation 4:8) while Jesus (the mediator) intercedes for us to make atonement for our sins with His precious Blood (through Him, with Him, in Him……..) (Hebrews 7:25).

Thereafter we celebrate the feast with a sacrificial meal (Communion) along with the angels and saints (festal gathering).  If we have this meal with mortal sins on our soul then we will have to face the judgement of God (the judge of all) (1 Corinthians 11:27).  During worship the priest eventually leads us to the Altar (the heavenly Jerusalem) where Jesus, the High Priest & King waits for us (Revelation 14:1).

Mount Zion is the hill in Jerusalem on which Jesus instituted the Eucharist / Last Supper) (on Maundy Thursday), the same place where the Church was born when the Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles, on the mother of Jesus and on the first congregation, on Pentecost Sunday.

The Last Supper and Pentecost Sunday were the two events which sealed the new Covenant.  God blessed Zion abundantly in the old Covenant (Psalm 2:6; 132:13-14)
The Letter to the Hebrews was written in the first century AD when devotion to the angels was still very common.

David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David (2 Samuel 5:7).
Every time we gather around the Table of the Lord (the Altar) to worship God our spirits are actually in Heaven with the angels and saints celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus in the new Passover.

Hebrews 12:24
*The spirits of just men made perfect.*
The saints in heaven right now are incomplete because they do not have their bodies. This is why Scripture refers to the blessed in heaven as “the spirits/souls of the martyrs” (Rev. 6:9).

Hebrews 13:11-12
*For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, are burned outside the camp.*\
*Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.*
The animals which were burned outside the camp were a shadow of Jesus who was an image of the first Adam on the Cross.  But the blood of Jesus is holy, so after the first Adam was destroyed outside the city gates, the blood of Jesus is offered during every Mass to sanctify us by making atonement for our sins (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).
