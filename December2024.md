### The Council at Jerusalem

[![The Council at Jerusalem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day336.jpg)](https://youtu.be/i9JLabc1K1E "The Council at Jerusalem")

### BIAY Day 336 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 15:2
*No less dissention.*
This was Luke's polite way of saying that there was a huge explosive argument due to disagreement, that it almost led to a quarrel.
The members of the council didn't end up in dividing the Church in response to the difference of opinion.  They made a common decision and then abided by that decision.  That is the principle of an ecumenical council.

Acts 15:1-12
*Why was there a huge debate in the early Church?*

Paul’s refusal to impose the Mosaic Law upon the gentile converts, provoked very strong objection from the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem.  This was one of the common problems in almost all the first century Churches (Romans 3:21-31; Galatians 3:1-5).\
For more than a thousand years they were given to understand that, according to the Mosaic Law, an uncircumcised man, along with his family, cannot be part of God’s family (Genesis 17:12-14).

Although they understood that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism, they were unable to understand why the gentiles were being baptized and allowed into the Churches, without being circumcised.

When the Jewish Christians from the sect of Pharisees started spreading the wrong message, it created confusion within the entire Church.
This topic led to a huge debate between the Apostles and the priests, until Peter stood up during the Council at Jerusalem, and in his authority as the Pope / Prime Minister of God’s Kingdom (the Church), he made the final decision, through the power of the Holy Spirit, that people could now enter the Church and be part of God’s family through faith followed by baptism, not circumcision.\
Thus baptism replaced circumcision.

The purpose of showing Peter the vision (Acts 10:9-16) and sending him to preach to Cornelius and his household earlier (Acts 10:19-20), and thereafter to baptize them (Acts 10:48), was to teach Peter that the Mosaic rituals were soon to be replaced with new rituals.  With the Cornelius event in mind, the Holy Spirit may have also reminded Peter that before the Ascension, Jesus did not command them to circumcise all nations, but to baptize them.

Therefore, Paul’s refusal to impose the Mosaic law on the gentile Christians was supported by Peter on the ground that within his own experience God bestowed the Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household without pre-conditions concerning the adoption of the Mosaic law.

Satan always uses his disciples to create problems and confusion, but God allows those problems to teach us how to move forward on the right path, and we will do well if we live in obedience to God’s commandments.

The Apostles had not addressed this issue earlier, therefore by allowing this problem in the Church God was teaching the Apostles how to organize and develop the Church, just as God allowed problems in the House of Israel to teach Moses how to organize and develop his community (Exodus 18:19-24; Numbers 11:16).

Debates and problems in the Church between the bishops and the clergy are common and are required to help the Church grow. These are times of trial which we must go through for purification and growth. When there's a difference in opinion, a meeting is called and the debate begins with a prayer for guidance from the Holy Spirit. After the debate a common decision is arrived at.
The important thing is that the Church remained unified inspite of the debate.

When the Church is challenged by heresies then it becomes necessary to hold a council and come to a decision in order to protect the faith of its entire congregation.

However, when the faith of a minority is shaken by heresies, then the Bishop may resolve the issue through epistles as Paul did.

The council at Jerusalem was the first council held by the Church but not the only one.  Thereafter many councils have been held, as and when the need arose.

The *Mosaic Civil law* was not required to be followed universally because it applied only to Israel.  Therefore, it was eventually deleted.
However, the *Mosaic Religious and Moral laws* must be followed by the subjects (the Christians) of the holy Kingdom, and therefore cannot be deleted.  They were however gradually modified with the guidance of the Holy Spirit to suit the new Covenant requirement due to the change in priesthood (Hebrews 7:12).
Acts 15:7-21
Peter spoke on behalf of everyone and gave a doctrinal pronouncement about what the Church believes (Acts 15:7–12) because Peter was the first Pope / Prime Minister, and James gave a practical solution (Acts 15:13–21) because James was the Bishop of Jerusalem.

The Apostles (bishops) and presbyters (priests), in agreement with the whole Church (the laity), wrote a letter to the gentile Christians with their decision which became the new Law of the Church (Acts 15:22–29).

<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/7%E2%80%9312>
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/13%E2%80%9321>
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/22%E2%80%9329>

1 Corinthians 11:10
*For this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.*
This is a warning that gender confusion and improper attire, during worship, will offend the heavenly hosts. Angels are ministers of the natural order and angels are present during the sacramental worship of the Church (Hebrews 12:22). Therefore it is important that we stand in front of the Altar with modest clothing.

1 Corinthians 11:26
*For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.*
Paul, and the other Apostles, always ended the proclamation of the Gospel with breaking of the bread (Mass).

“Proclaiming the Gospel” means that during every (Mass) the Christians must re-live the ministry of Christ on earth from the baptism of Jesus to His resurrection, where the Priest represents Christ and the congregation represents the first disciples of Christ during His ministry on earth.

“Proclaiming the Gospel” includes :

> > )  forgiving the people’s sins (through the Penitential Rite);
> > )  glorifying God (The Gloria).
> > )  reading the scriptures from Old & New Testament, Psalms & Prophets;
> > )  preaching the Gospel;
> > )  teaching the people how to apply the Gospel to their lives with reference to the readings of the day (through the homily);
> > )  consecrating the bread and wine and offering them to God as a perfect sacrifice in atonement for sins (anamnesis / re-living the Upper Room and Calvary events); and,
> > )  celebrating the Resurrection by eating the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ (Communion) (re-living the post resurrection events) (Luke 24:30).

1 Corinthians 11:27-30
Paul uses judicial language because when we receive the Body of Christ in an unworthy manner (with a mortal sin) we are abusing the Body of Christ and therefore breaking the Covenant with God, the result of which we have seen in the case of Judas (Acts 1:18) when he made the same mistake (John 13:27).

When we continuously abuse the Body of Christ / Eucharist we are in a continuous Covenant with Satan, which is the reason why we have so many problems in life.  Receiving the Body of Christ with a mortal sin is like playing with fire.

A person cannot become guilty of eating and drinking the Body and Blood of Christ unworthily if the bread and wine were not the real Body and Blood of Christ.

During every Mass when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution “this is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant” (Matthew 26:28) we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse (Revelation 16:1-17).\
During every Mass we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement.

1 Corinthians 11:27
Our sacrifice becomes cause of our judgement when it is offered with an unclean heart because we offer a sacrifice for the renewal of a Covenant, not a contract.

When we don’t receive the Body of Christ / Communion in a state of grace or we do not attend the new Covenant Passover celebration (Mass) every Sunday, God is glorified less than He should be and the world is sanctified less than it should be.

It is, therefore, not surprising that sin in the world is increasing, thus giving Satan the power to cause famines, natural disasters, crisis at state / national / global level, problems between family members, terminal illnesses, and suffering & misery in many other forms.

1 Corinthians 12:12–13
*For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.*
We (the body parts of Christ) are united with Christ (the Head) through our Baptism.
One single part of the human body cannot say that *it is a body.*  It can only be *a part* of the human body.  But when all parts are in union with each other then they become *one body.*
Likewise, each individual Christian cannot say that he/she is the Body of Christ.  We become one body only when we are all united in Christ by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace.  If any one of our body parts is separated permanently, it would definitely decay.  Moreover, a separated body part cannot function on its own, without the head, because it will have no life.
Therefore, if we don't live our Christian lives in union with Christ (the Head), then our sinful soul will eventually decay and end up in Hell.

### Day 336 The gifts of the Holy Spirit.

In our modern day and age, we seem to have either suppressed or forgotten the gifts of the Holy Spirit. St Paul urges us not to be unaware of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;
5there are different forms of service but the same Lord;
6there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 1 Cor 12:1-6

There are different gifts but there is only one reason for them, for the service of the Lord. All these gifts are given to us by the same Spirit. These gifts can be used to edify our own spiritual lives and the lives of everyone around us. The gifts are for the building up of the church. The gifts do not make one great or one insignificant, let us remember that it is a gift we did not earn it or deserve it.
To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
9to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
10to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. 1 Cor 12:8-10

The gifts can be listed as:

1. Wisdom
2. Knowledge
3. Faith
4. Healing
5. Mighty deeds(Miracles)
6. Prophecy
7. Discernment of spirits
8. Tongues
9. Interpretation of tongues

The gift of knowledge is to gain supernatural insight into something or someone’s life like people have a vision of something or a strong feeling that the Holy Spirit is speaking to them about something.

The gift of Wisdom is similar to knowledge only difference is it’s usually direction from the Holy Spirit on how to act, it’s more like getting hearing Holy Spirit teach us the will of God or at least a hint about what God wants us to do.
The gift of Faith is not just regular faith that we all have, faith the Jesus is God and the other basic teachings of the church. The gift of Faith is a supernatural gift that we gain such confidence at a certain moment that we know that we are able to pray for God’s supernatural intervention.
People with the gift of healing can lay hands and pray over the sick for natural or supernatural healing.

The gift to work mighty deeds and Miracles are a great sign for the non-believers.
A person with the gift of prophecy is able to listen to the Spirit and speak out God’s words, usually, you will hear the person with this gift say “I sense the Lord saying” followed by the message – it usually is a like a verse from the Bible. The prophecy should always be in alignment with the teaching of Jesus and the church.

The gift of discernment of spirit is a gift that will help us know the where the prophecy is coming from or what spirit is behind a certain action. Like a person who seems to be possessed by the evil may actually only have a medical problem. Anyone with the gift of discernment will be able to discern if it’s because of evil spirit or not.

The gift of tongues is one of the most common gifts, the person with the gift of tongues prays according to the will of the Father in mourns and groans too deep for any human language to explain. But God who looks into the hearts knows the intent.

The gift of tongues is most useful to the congregation when someone has the gift of interpretation of tongues. So that everyone in the congregation will be able to know what the person praying in tongues has just prayed.
Although the gifts of the Spirit may see pretty spectacular, we should not use the gifts as a yardstick for the greatness of the person. Because the gifts are not earned but given, the gifts will cease but one thing will remain. Let us wait till tomorrow to know what is greater than any gift.

Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.
But I shall show you a still more excellent way. 1 Cor 12:31

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Importance of Love

[![The Importance of Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day337.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ekHYubXUoCA "The Importance of Love")

### BIAY Day 337 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 16:3
*Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.*

Paul wanted Timothy to be circumcised because the Jews would not allow an uncircumcised man to enter their territory.  The Jews still strongly believed that every man had to be circumcised, whether he wanted to be a member of the Temple or the Church.  Paul needed Timothy to assist him in his religious work so the only option left was to circumcise Timothy so that they could both enter the Jewish areas and continue their work.

Although the decision had been made during the first council that circumcision was not required to enter the Church, Peter's encyclical had not yet reached all the Churches (v. 4).  It was therefore very important for Paul to visit those areas to settle the disputes between the Jews and the gentiles.

Since circumcision was ordained by God, Timothy was willing to go through it for the sake of the Gospel.

In the process of doing God's work, like Timothy, we must be willing to sacrifice our comfort, if we have to, for the sake of the Gospel, making sure that whatever we do is according to God's Will.

Acts 16:6-10
Everything that Paul was doing for the Church was good work but there's a difference between doing good work and God's work.

Paul had a desire to go to preach in Asia, but God had different plans. God wanted Paul to focus his preaching more in the Greeko-Roman territory because of his knowledge of multiple languages and the culture of the people. Although Paul's intentions were good and he was doing his work for the Lord, he humbled himself and submitted himself to the Lord's desire.

It was at this point that Paul met Luke. Also, the Macedonians were in some kind of trouble and they needed urgent help.

If Paul had gone to Asia against God's Will then maybe he would not have met the evangelist Luke and the Macedonians would not have been saved on time.

Like Paul, sometimes when we have a particular plan laid out to do God’s work, God may inspire our superiors to use our potential in a different way or in a different area that may not have been in our plans. During such time let us humble ourselves and submit ourselves to the Lord's desire, even if we don't like the new mission, rather than fighting with our superiors and being adamant about following only the desire of our heart.  If we forcibly decide to do God's work our own way then the good work which we do is not God's work because it is being done in disobedience to God and therefore contrary to God’s plan.  In the process of doing God's work, like Paul, we must be willing to sacrifice our plans for the sake of the Gospel.  If we allow pride to stand before us, God may give the chance to someone else and not use us at all.

Evangelisation is not about doing God's work the way *we* want it done.
Evangelisation is about doing God's work the way *God* wants it done.
When in doubt, always pray.

Acts 16:25-27
*About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God as the prisoners listened, there was suddenly such a severe earthquake that the foundations of the jail shook; all the doors flew open, and the chains of all were pulled loose.  When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew \[his\] sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.*

Paul and Silas were beaten and thrown in prison but they did not complain or curse their offenders.  Instead, they spent their time in prison praying and singing hymns to God.  Therefore, through their suffering Jesus converted the jailer.
God allowed the earthquake and opened the gates of the prison to move the jailer to ask for salvation.

Acts 16:30-31
*Then the jailer brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”*
*And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you and your household will be saved.”*

The faith of the head of the family was sufficient to baptize the entire non-Christian household because the entire household is expected to obey and respect the head of the family.  Minor children and infants were also included in the baptism because they are under the authority of their parents.  Moreover, children were not allowed to choose a different faith than their parents.

On the other hand, if we are disturbed with the behaviour of any of our family members, God is well aware of what is happening but He will not intervene to bring peace into our homes because He is waiting for us to repent and change ourselves.

If we repent with godly repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10) and lead holy lives, our fallen-away family members can eventually be saved.

God allowed the violent earthquake and whatever happened at the prison on that day because He wanted the jailer and his household to be converted.

The apostles converted the entire households of many Jews and gentiles in the first century AD because one member accepted Jesus and the rest of their families followed in their footsteps.

Therefore,  instead of wasting our time trying to change our difficult spouse, our rebellious children, our nagging in-laws, etc., let us first examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to the Lord in all we do and say.  And let us be thankful to God in every situation, positive or negative, even though we cannot see any good in the negatives.

1 Corinthians 13:1-3
*If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.*
*And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.  If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body to be burnt so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.*

Speaking in tongues, prophetic powers, faith in Christ, knowledge of scriptures, donating all our possessions, martyrdom, etc., are all good, but if we hate or dislike even one human, living or dead, then we are not in a state of grace and everything else we do is in vain.

The new law is a law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love, written on our hearts, and must be put into practice.  It is not meant just to be kept in our memories or on our tongues.

If we cannot love everyone 100 percent and if we cannot help those in need then we have disobeyed the new Commandment and our worship is all false.

True faith in God combined with true love of neighbor produces good works of mercy just as a good tree produces good fruits (Matthew 21:18-22).

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day 337 Love never fails

The gifts of the Holy Spirit are not sanctifying gifts, they are for the common good of the Church. Of course, they can aid in our sanctification if we cooperate with God’s will. But the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not the yardstick, the fruits of the Holy Spirit are what we should look for.
If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.
2And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. 1 Cor 13:1-2

So if someone has all the gifts and no fruits they are a noisy cymbal. All the gifts of the Holy Spirit should operate out of love. Love in our modern-day standards is stripped of its true meaning. The true meaning of love is stated in Corinthians.
Love is patient,
Love is kind.
Love is not jealous,
Love is not pompous, it is not inflated,
Love is not rude,
Love does not seek its own interests
Love is not quick-tempered
Love does not brood over injury,
Love does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. 1 Cor 13:4-8

The best way to judge a person is not with the gifts but by the fruits. We should see if the person is patient, kind, not proud, not jealous, not rude or quick-tempered, does not brood over injury or hold a record of wrongs. The person can bear all things, believe and hope for all things and endures all things.
We need to grow and develop the fruits of the Spirit, cooperate with God’s grace and develop fruit. That is why St Paul said that Love will never fail, everything else will be pass away.

If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.
9For we know partially and we prophesy partially,
10but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love. 1 Cor 13:8-10, 13.

So let us strive for the gifts of the Holy Spirit, so we can serve the church and also edify our spiritual lives. But our focus should be on our relationship with the Lord. We should grow in the fruits of the Holy Spirit because only the fruit last the gifts will cease.

Let us grow in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Gal 5:22,23

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Death Defeated

[![Death Defeated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day338.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hOyFIABD9IY "Death Defeated")

### Day 338 O death where your is your sting

All the advancement in science and technology has not allowed anyone to live forever. Death can be extended but never overcome.
None of the gods in this world can say they have overcome death or are able to rise again from the dead. Thanks be to God Jesus died and rose again, He now gives us eternal life.

“Death is swallowed up in victory.
55Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?”
56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
57But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Cor 15: 54-57

We have nothing to fear as the worst thing that can happen to anyone death, has been conquered by Jesus Christ. We have victory through Christ, we have life eternal, after we died we live forever. We just transition from earthly life to eternal heavenly life.

Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
52in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53For that which is corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility, and that which is mortal must clothe itself with immortality. 1 Cor 15:51-53

On our own we are not holy enough to enter into God’s presence, we are mortal and corrupt. But when we put on Christ, the immortal and incorruptibility we are made perfect and holy so we can enter into the presence of God.
Some of us have a lifetime to prepare and some will not, so we are to always be ready for the Lord. The seasons of the church, Advent and Lent are perfect times to reset and reevaluate our lives. Everything corrupt needs to be clothed with Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 339 Living as a loving community

Many people stay away from church because of a bad experience with other folks at church. People are hurt intentionally or unintentionally, and people feel excluded or unworthy. Let us try to overcome all of these and come together as a loving community for Christ.

Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
Your every act should be done with love.
I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they made up for your absence,
18for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such people.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Cor 20: 13,14,17,18,20

St Paul encourages us to be on our guard and to stand firm in our faith, to be courageous and strong, and do everything out of love. We have to be strong both inside and outside the church, we should stand firm when someone tries to push us around, our faith should overcome any fear or overpower any negativity. We should do everything out of love, remember love is patient, kind, enduring, does not hold grudges, not proud or rude. We are called to be a good example in the church, and exhibit love where there seems to be a lack of love.

We should also love the Lord above everything else.
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Marana tha. 1 Cor 12:3

St Paul seems to be coming off to strong here when we said if anyone does not love the Lord let him be accursed. But a deeper understanding of the word can help.

Accursed: literally, “anathema.” This expression (cf. 1 Cor 12:3) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in preparation for the Lord’s coming and judgment

During the season of Advent don’t we pray Maranatha?

Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the early Christian liturgy. As understood here (“O Lord, come!”), it is a prayer for the early return of Christ.
Come Lord Jesus Come.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Power of the Holy Spirit

[![The Power of the Holy Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day340.jpg)](https://youtu.be/S66B7h4dObE "The Power of the Holy Spirit")

### Day 340 A true Christian life should have a personal relationship with Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit.

Many people complain that faith and religion are boring and that they get nothing out of church. Sunday Mass becomes another weekend chore like grocery shopping. We may be missing one of these two important parts of our faith.
We see how the evil spirit tossed up the sons of Sceva, because they did not have a personal relationship with Jesus.

Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”
14When the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, tried to do this,
15the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I recognize, Paul I know, but who are you?”
16The person with the evil spirit then sprang at them and subdued them all. He so overpowered them that they fled naked and wounded from that house.
We cannot live our faith lives with textbook knowledge of Jesus, we need to have a loving and living relationship with Jesus. We cannot just claim to know “about” Jesus but need know him.

“You are one with Jesus as the body is one with the head. You must then have one breath with him, one soul, one life, one will, one mind, one heart, and he must be your breath, heart, love, life, your all.”—Saint John Eudes

The second thing missing in our life may be a relationship with the Holy Spirit. We may be like the Christians in Ephesus who had no clue who the Holy Spirit us.
When I was younger I though the Holy Spirit was just a nice dove that flew around and descended on Jesus at His Baptism. Some people think of the Holy Spirit as a symbol of fire, dove or wind.

He said to them, “Did you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?” They answered him, “We have never even heard that there is a holy Spirit.”
3He said, “How were you baptized?” They replied, “With the baptism of John.”
4Paul then said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”
5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6And when Paul laid \[his\] hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.Ep 19:2-6

The Holy Spirit is no simple dove, but the very life support of our souls. The Holy Spirit is our advocate, counselor, helper, teacher, guide and the very help that Jesus promised us. Jesus said it was better that He went away so that the Holy Spirit can be sent. The Holy Spirit gave the fearful disciples courage to come out of hiding and preach the good news – without fearing even death.
Let us spend time to speak with Jesus each day and listen to His words, be led by the Holy Spirit and live a love and joy filled life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 340 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 19:5-6
*When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.*
*And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.*

The believers received two Sacraments.
The believers entered the Church with faith.  They were then baptized with water (v.5) (Sacrament of Baptism) to wash away all past sins (for adults), including the curse of original sin (for all), and make them worthy of being part of God’s family, thus enabling them to receive sanctifying graces and take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion).  Thereafter Paul (the Apostle/Bishop) confirmed them by laying his hands upon them (v.6) to receive the Holy Spirit (Sacrament of Confirmation).
When we receive the first Sacrament (water baptism) the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Jesus (1 Corinthians 12:13) but when we receive the second Sacrament (Confirmation) Jesus baptizes us with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 2:4).
Through Baptism we receive the life of the Trinity and through Confirmation we receive the mission of the Trinity.

Acts 19:11-12
*So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God accomplished at the hands of Paul that when face cloths or aprons that touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.*
God heals people even through material things or through dead bodies just as God heals our bodies through the doctors, and heals our souls through the priests; and just as God sanctifies us through water (baptism), and anoints us through oil, etc.
When the dead body of a Moabite touched Elisha’s dead body the Moabite became alive (2 Kings 13:20-21).
People were healed when they touched the fringe of the garment of Jesus (Mathew 14:35-36; Mark 5:28-29).
God uses people and material things to heal people because He wants us to remain in communication with each other to build a family relation.

Acts 19:13-16
*Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”  Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.  But the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.*
Exorcism in the name of Jesus cannot be performed without faith in Jesus.
Exorcism performed without the name of Jesus would be demonic.
Exorcism performed without being in a state of grace can be dangerous for the exorcist.

The authority to exorcise demons was given by Jesus only to the 12 apostles. He didn't give the authority to His other disciples.
Exorcising demons is not something that anyone can do. To be a successful exorcist it is very important that a man has to be an ordained priest living in a state of grace otherwise it can prove to be disastrous or even fatal for him.

### Eternal Weight of Glory

[![Eternal Weight of Glory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day341.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_JwmReST630 "Eternal Weight of Glory")

### Day 341 We walk by faith, not by sight.

The Christian life is a life of dependence on God, we may not know God’s plan for us but we trust Him fully. We do not go by what we see but walk by faith, knowing that the God who created us will take care of us. We may feel abandoned or alone on this journey especially when we are going through the trials of life. Let us rest assured that Jesus is walking with us and is carrying us.

“We walk by faith, not by sight.” 2corinthians 5:5
We will face many challenges in life, we may feel as though we are crushed but we will rise again in the strength of the Lord.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;
2 Cor 4:8-9

Although we may seem persecuted, afflicted and struck down, we should have faith and we God will make a way out for us. We will never be constrained or driven to despair or destroyed. We will rise up with wings as eagles and our strength will be renewed. The Lord Himself will hold our hands and lift us up. When we are weak He is strong.
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.

11For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 2 Cor 4:10-11

When we suffer, we suffer with Christ, He is the head and we are the body. But our suffering will bring new life in heaven. Our suffering takes on a new meaning when we unite our suffering with Christ's suffering for the salvation of the world.
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence. 2 Cor 4: 14

Our suffering will not be in vain the Holy Spirit will raise us up into the presence of Jesus.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Generous Hearts

[![Generous Hearts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day342.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pM7Yv6QskfI "Generous Hearts")

### Day 342 The real struggles of being a disciple of Christ.

When we read about the great miracles performed by the early disciples we can assume that they were able to do anything. But the disciples had real problems and suffering. They needed to be strong and endure the hardships that came their way.

We cause no one to stumble in anything, in order that no fault may be found with our ministry;
4 on the contrary, in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships, constraints,
5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts;
6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
7in truthful speech, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
8through glory and dishonor, insult and praise. We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
9as unrecognized and yet acknowledged; as dying and behold we live; as chastised and yet not put to death;
10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things. 2 Cor 6:3-10

The disciples had to endure so many hardships as listed above, that they were beaten and not respected. They were proclaiming the truth but were considered deceivers. They were chastised and put to death because they decided to preach Christ.
In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the church of their many sins. He prayed and hoped that they would change their lives for the Lord.
For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it; and if I did regret it (\[for\] I see that that letter saddened you, if only for a while),
9I rejoice now, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened into repentance; for you were saddened in a godly way, so that you did not suffer loss in anything because of us.

10For godly sorrow produces a salutary repentance without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death. 2 Cor 7:8-10

Paul’s suffering and struggle did not go in vain, his first letter bore good fruit. The church in Corinth repented and there is great rejoining in heaven when anyone repents.
Sometimes as parents or leaders, we should not hesitate to correct those in our care. We are responsible for their spiritual lives, we should tell people that they are wrong when needed.
Let us pray for all teachings, leaders, priests, parents, elders, or anyone in authority.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 342 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 21:13
*Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”*

The man who once took the life of a Christian because of his faith (Acts 7:58) was now ready to give his own life for the same faith.  One act of mercy from Stephen changed the life of Paul forever and brought thousands into the Church.
Paul's conversion should give us hope that if we forgive our persecutors and pray for them, it is possible that they will repent and accept Christ some day.\
However sinful a person may be, God can convert anyone anytime and use them for His glory.

Therefore, while we make sure to pray for our brothers and sisters who are victims of persecution, let us not forget to pray for the conversion of the persecutors.

2 Corinthians 6:2
*For he says: “In an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.”  Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.*
For us, the day of salvation is not what happened 2000 years ago.  For us, the day of salvation is "today" because we are members of the Body of Christ.
We ask the Lord to give us our new Manna "today" (Matthew 6:11) so that we can consume it “today” because if we keep it for the next day it will rot (Exodus 16:19-20).\
We are building bridges, not walls.

2 Corinthians 6:16–18
*We are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  Therefore, come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters.”*

This promise was made to the Israelites (Leviticus 26:11-12; Ezekiel 20:41) but now it is only for the Christians (Jewish and non-Jewish).

When we receive the Body of Christ (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) we receive divine life and thus we become temples of the living God because God will live in us until we commit a mortal sin.

2 Corinthians 7:10
*For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.*
True godly sorrow is sorrow over having wounded and broken God’s heart with our sins.  The Holy Spirit will bring out that sorrow.  We cannot truly repent without the Holy Spirit convicting us of our sin.

Trying to appear repentant and sorrowful to escape the consequences of our wrong doings in this world, after being caught, is not true repentance.\
Repenting and confessing sins without the feeling of guilt, just to keep out of Hell, is also not true repentance.\
Those are all types of worldly sorrow.

When we realize just how much God loves us, and when we feel the pain that Jesus felt during His passion for our sins, the Holy Spirit will make that awareness come to us and cause us to grieve. It is more like a rebellious young man in a prison cell reflecting on how he hurt and disgraced his parents and siblings by committing a crime; that is godly sorrow.  It is the sorrow that comes from our heart.

2 Corinthians 8:9
*For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.*
Jesus was rich when He was divine but He became a poor human so that by receiving Him into our bodies in a state of grace we can share in His divine nature.  In other words, Jesus in His generosity gave up His divinity to make us spiritually rich.\
Likewise, in imitation of Christ, we too must give up all our earthly comfort and luxury and lead simple lives so that we can give our excess to the poor to help raise them up to our level (Acts 4:34-35).

Thus we can gradually erase poverty with our generosity.

### Day 343 Boast in our weakness

St Paul went through many trails and hardships as he persistently preached Jesus.
I am still more, with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, far worse beatings, and numerous brushes with death.

24Five times at the hands of the Jews I received forty lashes minus one.
25Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I passed a night and a day on the deep;
26on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own race, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers;
27in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights, through hunger and thirst, through frequent fastings, through cold and exposure.
28And apart from these things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 1 Cor 11:23-28

St Paul was beaten, stoned, shipwrecked, exposed to the dangers of elements, robbers, wilderness, sea, fasting, hunger and most hard of all daily pressure and anxiety for all the churches. Instead of running away from suffering, Paul decided to boast in them, boast in his weakness.
“If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness” 2 Cor 11:30.

As a spiritual exercise let us try to reflect on two things.

1. What suffering am I willing to go through for the sake of the Kingdom?
2. What do I boast in, my strengths or my weaknesses.

In our weakness, we are strong, because God's power is made perfect in out weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 343 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 22:30
God could have definitely freed Paul but it was not His Will at that moment because it would not accomplish God's salvation plan.

If we are going through some problem or sickness or suffering, there is no harm in asking God to free us from the problem or sickness or suffering but until the solution comes we must continue focusing on God's Will because that may have been God's way of leading us on His path.

2 Corinthians 9:7
*Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.*
The sheep received their heavenly reward because they were charitable and the goats were condemned.
Paul was teaching the people how important it was to be charitable.

2 Corinthians 10:12
*We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they do not show good sense.*
False prophets equal themselves to eloquent speakers to prove that they are the true prophets.

2 Corinthians 11:4
*For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.*
The false prophets may have been teaching one or more of the below heresies which had already started spreading during the first century AD:

1. Jesus was not God
2. Jesus was not man,
3. Jesus wasn't crucified,
4. Jesus didn't rise from the dead.
   Paul gave the people a choice.  They could either embrace the truth, even if the preacher was not a good speaker, or they could accept an impressive preacher who tickled their ears with lies.

### The Thorn in Paul's Side

[![The Thorn in Paul's Side](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day344.jpg)](https://youtu.be/GZadAsEqM8o "The Thorn in Paul's Side")

### Day 344 My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.

St Paul received great revelation from God, he did not meet the other disciples or learn much from them, we all remember Jesus appeared to him during his conversion when he was struck down from the horse. It seems he was receiving all this doctrine supernaturally.

Therefore, that I might not become too elated, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.

Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me,
9 but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.” I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.
10Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Cor 12:8-10

St Paul was given a thorn in his flesh, we can only speculate if it was a sin, sickness or disability. Or probably the inability to speak well in public or his poor eyesight. Whatever it was it really troubled him, Paul begged God to take it away 3 times, here 3 times is not literally 3 times it must have been more than three. 3 is a complete number symbolizing the trinity – so St Paul really prayed through and prayed completely for this thorn to be removed.

God did not answer him positively but gave him a better solution. The solution was God himself, it was not by our holiness but by God’s power that our weakness is made strong. We are made perfect in Christ. God’s grace is sufficient for us, whatever is lacking in us is filled by God’s love.
God was saving Paul from the greatest sin of all, the sin of Pride. That is why the thorn was permitted in Paul’s life.

So when you struggle with habitual sin or a chronic condition and wonder why God does not deliver you from it, maybe it’s God’s way of keeping us close to Him. Whenever you find yourself lacking or weak run to Jesus in the sacrament of Reconciliation and the Eucharist. God’s grace is sufficient for us, power is made perfect in weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 344 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 23:6-11
Paul was aware of the mixed crowd in front of him and therefore used his wisdom to create a situation which would force the Sanhedrin to transfer him to Rome, where he wanted to take the Gospel because Rome was the center of the world during those days. He distracted them with his statement and pitted them against each other, causing an uproar in the House so that he would be removed from the trial.

2 Corinthians 12:7-10
*Therefore, that I might not become too elated because of the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.   Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me, but he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.”  I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.   Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.*

The thorn in the flesh may have been an adversary of Paul who was making his life miserable, or it may have been a wound that hurt him real bad, like a throbbing pain, so he begged the Lord to take away his suffering.

Like Jesus in the garden of Gethsemene, three times Paul begged Jesus to spare him of the suffering but the answer was "no," therefore Paul accepted the suffering as God's Will.  The healing was withheld for a higher purpose.

When God chooses people for His mission, He will break them with sufferings (sickness, insults, humiliation, rejection, problems, etc.) so that when people see the positive results inspite of the suffering they will believe that it is because of the power of God working in those chosen people and not because of their expertise.  The suffering is also meant to humble the chosen ones so that they may not boast about their achievements.

When Paul spoke of his credentials he did not refer to the degrees or certificates which he had acquired from learning under the guidance of the famous Rabbi.  Rather he spoke of his sufferings (2 Corinthians 11:23-28) because, by being patient and resigned during his sufferings for the sake of Christ he had allowed Christ to suffer through him and thus made Christ victorious in bringing salvation to others.

Paul clearly understood his mission as a follower of Christ and was faithful to his mission.
If we have not understood our mission as Christians then let us ask the Lord to help us understand His Will for us.

2 Corinthians 12:12
*The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, signs and wonders and mighty works.*
The proof of a prophet or apostle chosen by God is seen in the miracles which the prophet or apostle  works.

### One in Christ

[![One in Christ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day345.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iTLJ-8gh3Zk "One in Christ")

### Day 345 Just being a good person is not our Christian calling.

"I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me"

Many people try to justify not going to Church by saying – “I’m a good person”. They are trying to justify themselves by following the law, not the Jewish law but their own law. People make up their own rules or follow the moral rules of natural law and think they will get to heaven. Heaven is described as a place where God is present and if people don’t want to have anything to do with God on earth then there is no point in going to heaven to be with God forever.

who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.Gal 2:16

We are not saved by works, so just doing good works will not get us to heaven. If we could be saved by being a good person then there was no need for Jesus to die for us.
If we are satisfied by just being a good person we fall into the trap of being perfect and not needing a savior, because we have already achieved what is good.
We are to have faith in Christ, we need to die to ourselves and live in Christ.

For through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;
20yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.
21I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.Gal 2: 19-21

Living a life united with Christ on earth will get us to heaven. When goodness itself lives in our heart, we radiate the love of Christ to this dark world.
It is no longer about me, it’s about Christ present in my heart. My hands are not mine anymore but Christ’s hands which love the poor and weak. My feet are not mine but Christ’s which are feet that bring good news to the world.
I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

Galatians 1:6-12
The false Gospel which Paul was referring to was the teaching which some people were spreading among the gentiles that accepting the Gospel and being baptized was fine, but if they truly wanted to be saved then, in addition, it was also necessary that they must be circumcised and they must follow the Mosaic Law.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

We must follow the Gospel which the Apostles have given us, not a Gospel that teaches us different, or a Gospel that has been modified.  In other words, if we depart from the Liturgy of the Church, we depart from Christ.

Galatians 2:10
Peter, James and John emphasized to Paul that he must always remember the poor.
From the time the law was first given to God’s people, God had emphasized that they must always take care of the poor (Deut. 15:11).  Jesus also reminded us of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).
Therefore, reading the Bible every day, praying for long hours, attending worship, etc. are all of no use if we have neglected the poor people around us.

Galatians 2:11-14
Peter was not giving any erroneous doctrinal teaching.  Paul opposed him because Peter was not practicing what he was preaching.
Spiritual leaders are sinners like us and are therefore likely to commit sins like us. Peter was trying to save his skin and therefore ended up going against his own teaching. In such cases they must be open to correction from their subordinates.

Galatians 2:16
*We, who are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles, yet who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.*

Paul was clearing the confusion among the Jews who had been baptized, that they had not received their hope for salvation because they were obedient to the Law of Moses, but that the gates of heaven had been opened for them because of God's grace.

We are not justified by works of the Mosaic Law or works that are not done for Christ.  The Mosaic Law was given to the people to discipline them and to live holy lives.  The Mosaic Law was not good enough to purify a person’s conscience/soul to receive salvation.   Therefore, after the resurrection, we now follow the Law of Christ, not the Law of Moses.

The early Church still being in its infancy, it was normal for the Jewish Christians to face such confusion because they were previously expected to strictly follow the Mosaic Law or else they would be cut out from God’s family.

Galatians 2:20
*Yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.*

Christ lives in us from the time we are baptized, and continues to live in us as long as we are in a state of grace and surrender our will to His Will.

Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was the first Christian in whom Christ lived physically, and the life which she lived in the flesh she lived by faith in the Son of God, her Son, who loved her and gave Himself up for her, as much as He gave Himself up for us.

Let us follow her example and live by true faith in Christ and for Christ so that Christ can live in us always.

Galatians 3:1-14
Paul was not speaking about good works of mercy, or against it.  According to the Jews "works of the Law" meant "strictly observing all the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law," example: ritual washing, circumcision, Sabbath, kosher diet, etc. Paul was explaining to the Galatians that by observing those ceremonies they would never be able to save their souls because those were only shadows of the reality of the Christian faith. They can be saved by faith in Jesus and by obeying all the commandments.

### Fruits of the Spirit

[![Fruits of the Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day346.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ai-TYQfqfJo "Fruits of the Spirit")

### Day 346 The Fruit of the Spirit

Just as a tree is known by its fruit, a disciple of Jesus is known by their fruits.

In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.Gal 5:22-23

We could spend hours going over each of these fruits and we should ponder on each of these each day. We can use the fruits of the Spirit to examine our conscience every night, check if we loved enough, had joy in our trials, keep the peace, were kind to strangers, generous to those in need, faithful to God, family and friends, did we have self-control on our senses? I’m sure we all will feel that we are lacking in some area or the other.
So how do we grow more fruit? The answer is simple we need to nourish the tree. We nourish ourselves with the Sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist, we prune dead branches at the sacrament of reconciliation. The trees need the sun to live so do we, we need the “Son” to live. Personal prayer and Bible reading are a critical part of our nourishment as well. Also trees stay together in a forest so they can withstand gusty winds and other elements, we likewise need the love of a community to grown and be strong.
Most important thing for a tree is water, we need the living waters – the Holy Spirit to thrive.

For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want. But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Gal 5:17-18

If we want to bear fruit we need to be guided by the Holy Spirit, we just cannot do what the flesh desires. The desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit. The works of the flesh can drag us down and stunt our growth.

Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,
20idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,
21occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Gal 5:19-21

Let us steer clear of the above traps of the flesh and be led by the Holy Spirit. If we can focus on leading a holy life, a life led and guided by the Holy Spirit the fruit of the Spirit will automatically grow and people will take joy in our presence. People will be drawn to us when they see the love, joy, peace, patience…..

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 347 Promises & Blessings from Ephesians 1

Sometime the best thing to do is read and ponder on the Bible. Let us do just that as we read the promises and blessings from Ephesians 1.

4 God choose us in Christ before the creation of the world

5 From Eternity he destined us in love to be his adopted sons and daughters in Christ

7 in Christ we obtain freedom, sealed by His blood
have forgiveness of sins greatness of his grace he lavishes on us

14 We were sealed by the Holy Spirit

17 May God reveal himself to you & give you a spirit of wisdom & revelation

18 May he enlighten your inner vision
May we know how great the inheritance, the glory, God sets apart for us

19 May we understand with what extraordinary power he acts in favor of us who believe

20 Jesus Christ is above all rule, power, authority, dominion or any supernatural force that could be named

22 God put all things under his feet, Christ is the head we are the body.

Let us Pray: Lord Jesus, reveal your self to me and may I experience the greatness of your grace. Thank you for working in my favor with extraordinary power. I submit my life at your feet Lord, lead me Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 347 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 26:14
*"It hurts you to kick against the goads (spikes)."*

This is a Greek proverb about useless and harmful resistance, well understood by the farmers. Stubborn yoked oxen that kick against the plowman will only hurt themselves on the goads (sharp spikes) behind them.

Jesus had told Paul that Paul’s resistance to the Gospel was futile to the point of being personally harmed.

This is true, not only for Paul, but for every human, Christian and non-Christian.
It is possible that a Christian can reject the Gospel some time after he is baptized, if he desires to follow another faith, either because he is threatened or offered some benefits or for any other reason.

Acts 26:32
*And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”*

Paul appealed to the emperor (Caesar), not because he wanted to be set free but because he had a strong desire to preach the Gospel to Caesar (Acts 28:xxxxx).\
Do we have that kind of passion to spread the Gospel even when times are bad for us?

### Rules for the New Life

[![Rules for the New Life](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day348.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DXRlsHSDHRo "Rules for the New Life")

### Day 348 Put on the armor of God

To live as a true Christian means to live in a war zone on earth. The world around us is not a perfect place to live in, there are many distractions, temptations, anxieties, and opposition. The world values are opposed to the Kingdom's values and principles. We sometimes overlook the fact that the devil and his fallen angels are constantly at war against us trying to rob, steal, and destroy our souls.
For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens Ep 6:12

We need to draw strength from the Lord who is all-powerful and the enemy stands defeated in His Mighty and Matchless name, the name of Jesus.
Finally, draw your strength from the Lord and from his mighty power. Ep 6:10

We need to guard ourselves against the contact attack we are under, the way to do that is to put on the whole armor of God. In fact, it is stated twice to put on the armor of God. When things are important they are mentioned twice. Just like Jesus said “truly truly I say to you”
Put on the armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the tactics of the devil. Ep 6:11

Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your ground. Ep 6:13
The armor of God is compared to a soldier’s armor, because we are in the battlefield.
So stand fast with your loins girded in truth, clothed with righteousness as a breastplate,
15and your feet shod in readiness for the gospel of peace.
16In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all \[the\] flaming arrows of the evil one.
17And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Ep 6:14-17

· Belt of Truth
· Breastplate of righteousness
· Shoes of Peace
· Shield of Faith
· Helmet of Salvation
· Sword of the Spirit – the word of God

BELT OF TRUTH
As a Christian we know that the truth sets us free, so we always have to secure our lives in the truth. Just as the belt holds our cloths secure and prevents us from disgrace, so does truth. My mom always said – “if you tell one lie, you will need to tell 10 more lies to cover that up.” We have to hold firm to the truth of the Gospel and the truth about ourselves.

BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
None our us can claim to be righteous except through the righteousness we receive from Christ. We should always stay in a state of grace, going to confession if we have any mortal sin on our hearts. Going to regular Mass helps wash away the venial sins.

SHOES OF PEACE
Blessed are the feet that bring good news to the world. We are called to be peacemakers and ones who will bring people together. We are called to go out to the ends of the earth to proclaim God’s word. Wearing shoes means ready and willing to go out as the Holy Spirit leads.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!” Is 52:7

SHIELD OF FAITH
In all circumstances we should hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. The evil one will shoot arrows of doubt, negativity, lies, confusion, envy, jealously, anger… we are to hold up the shield of Faith, knowing that God will take care of us. Holding up the shield of faith means knowing that God is on our side and no weapon formed against us will prosper.

HELMET OF SALVATION
Knowing that Jesus has saved us from death and that He will give us eternal life should always be on our minds. If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or depression, guard your mind with the Helmet of Salvation.
SWORD OF THE SPIRIT – THE WORD OF GOD
Imagine a soldier in a battle without his sword. The enemy will keep on attacking until the armor is broken. That is the case with many Christians today, they do not know the word of God. “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” So rightly said in Hosea we are unable to stand up against the devil because we do not know the Word of God. Remember Jesus in the desert fought off the devil with the Word of God. The Sword is the only offensive weapon we have, and so is the Word of God, it is sharper than any two-edged sword. If you want to live a victorious life, read scripture and memorize it. The Holy Spirit will bring to you the right scripture in battle.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 348 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 27:17
*They hoisted it aboard, then used cables to undergird the ship. Because of their fear that they would run aground on the shoal of Syrtis, they lowered the drift anchor and were carried along in this way.*

The sailors were afraid of being driven across to the quicksands of the African coast, so they lowered the topsails and were thus driven before the wind.
The ship that Paul was sailing on encountered a huge storm with hurricane force winds. For fourteen days they didn’t see the sun or the stars. The sailors tried their best to steer the ship, did everything they could to keep control, but the winds were too strong. Therefore, instead of fighting it and trying to force where they wanted the ship to go, they took down the sails and let the wind drive them.

Are we trying to control everything and getting upset because it’s not happening according to our way?  Are we trying to force things to happen our way?

When we have done everything we can —we have prayed, we have believed, we have stood in faith—there comes a time when we have to do like the sailors did:  Quit fighting it, quit trying to force it to work out, quit losing sleep, and release control of it into God’s hands. Then rest in faith and trust Him.  God will take the same winds that were meant to stop us and shift them to blow us forward according to His plan.

Acts 27:33-38
After breaking bread (“artos” in Greek) (v. 27:35), Paul did not distribute it as is the normal procedure.  Paul celebrated the new Passover (Mass) and consumed the Body of Christ (Holy Eucharist) himself, while the other people in the boat ate normal food (“trapheh” in Greek) (v. 27:34 & 36), probably because they were not baptized people.

Ephesians 4:7 and 11-13
*But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ’s gift.  The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.*

The duty of the people in authority in the Church is not only to spread the Gospel but also to train their subordinates to spread the Gospel. And the role of the subordinates in the Church is not a passive role of just listening to the Word of God, but, along with the people in authority, the subordinates must also play an active role in the Church by assisting in spreading the Gospel.

Ephesians 4:26
*Be angry but don't sin.*

When we are offended by others or when we see the wicked ones harming the innocent ones, it is understandable that such behavior makes us angry. But, in our anger, when we go one step further to retaliate, then we are no different than those sinners.

Creating a negative situation is the devil's way of dragging the good ones on his path.
God allows that to happen as a test for us and also so that we can bring those negative people close to Him with our patience, prayers and forgiveness.
When we face such situations let us remember that when Jesus was attacked physically and verbally, He did not retaliate.  Instead, He patiently bore the pain of the extreme torture and forgave them.

Ephesians 5:1-20
If a man uses his neighbors or friends to help him daily with his work, he will pay them at the end of the day or the month and send them home, but he will not give a share of his inheritance for his neighbors or friends.  His inheritance will always be for his obedient children, not even for his rebellious ones.  The rebellious ones may end up in prison for life.

Similarly, since God is a Holy Father, He may use many people to do His kingdom work on earth but His inheritance will only be for His obedient children.  The rebellious ones may end up in prison (Hell) for life.

Paul therefore warns us to beware of unholy life.  We must avoid sinful thoughts, sinful words and sinful deeds.  God’s children belong to Heaven and must therefore not allow anger, hatred, revenge, greed, selfishness, lies, disobedience, etc., etc. to enter their hearts (Ephesians 4:31-32).  Alcohol must be consumed within limits so that they don’t get drunk or else the evil spirit will start controlling them.  We must lead holy lives so that we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us always (v.18).

We are called to be like God by practicing our virtues.  We must therefore be kind, loving, generous, forgiving, etc.

Ephesians 5:1
*Be imitators of God, as beloved children.*

Paul was not asking us to divinize ourselves.

We have been created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), therefore we have the ability to be loving, forgiving, generous, kind, patient, understanding, etc. and we can imitate God by practicing these virtues.  This means that we must always remain in a Covenant relation with God, not with Satan.  We can go a long way by doing little acts of love and forgiveness, little acts of generosity and kindness, etc. both in and out of our homes.

God is love, and those who live in love live in God, and God lives in them (1 John 4:16).  God's Covenant love is free, faithful, total and fruitful.

If we say that we have surrendered ourselves to Christ, then we must love everyone around us unconditionally like Christ, and we must also be ready to suffer like Christ, because there is no true love without suffering.

Ephesians 5:3-7
When our faith is weak, we must not associate ourselves with people who take us away from God.  Instead, we must strengthen our faith and do our best to bring others closer to God by the way we live, speak and interact with others.
Idolatry is not just about worshipping statues of creation. Idolatry is also about spending more time with creation than required and less time with God.\
Example:  working extra hours, spending too much time with social media, entertainment (movies, TV shows, sports, etc.), etc.

Ephesians 5:8-14
Paul was addressing the Ephesians who were pagans before they came into the Church. They were probably not aware of what was good and what was bad because in paganism it was normal to accept certain practices which were abhorrent to God, such as abuse of women and children, idolatry, immorality, etc.
Christians must therefore, not only avoid doing those evils but they must also avoid speaking about them.

Ephesians 5:14-16
*Awake, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

Paul wants us to wake up from the sinful world, stay away from it and try to do everything that pleases God.  We do not know when our time on earth will end therefore we must spend our earthly life in making wise decisions that will help us to come closer to God by the way we live and by the way we act.

Ephesians 5:15-16
*Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

We must use our time to do God's Will and try to accomplish God's mission, as if we are going to die tomorrow. We must try to do whatever is possible when we are alive. We must not use our time to get involved with worldly things.

Ephesians 5:18-20
*Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.*

God gave the Israelites a land which was rich in grapes (Numbers 13:23), because wine was to be used in the daily offerings during the Liturgical services, in the old Covenant (Exodus 29:38-42) as well as in the new Covenant (Matthew 26:27; Revelation 6:6).

Therefore Paul does not say "don't drink wine"; He warns us not to get drunk because excess of anything, other than God, is a sin and the beginning of disaster.  Drinking wine is not a sin but if we don’t have self-control then it is better not to touch wine.

The Ephesians may have had a serious addiction to wine because Paul doesn't speak so strongly to the other Churches about getting drunk.  However, Paul's instructions are valid even today. When we consume wine beyond limit it causes evil words to flow out of our mouths, and thus we separate ourselves from God (Proverbs 23:31-35).  Instead, Paul wants us to use our tongues to worship God by singing Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, etc. and engage ourselves with activities that bring us closer to God.

Ephesians 5:21-33
The first level of humility is obedience.  The next level is service.
A baptized man is a symbol of Christ (the new Adam) and a baptized woman is a symbol of the Church (the new Eve) (Ephesians 5:23-24).
When a man does not obey God's commandments then he must not have any expectations from his wife because when the head of the family is in a Covenant with Satan then the whole family struggles spiritually.

Marriage with conditions is a contract, not a Covenant and is not from God.\
In marriage there is no return policy.
Man and wife must love and serve each other to bring out the best person in the spouse, and not to highlight their spouse’s weaknesses (Ephesians 5:21).  We must allow God to use our spouses to correct us whenever we are wrong.  Both man and wife must find ways to serve each other, and not expect to be served.

As the head of the family, a man's mission is to die to himself every day in order to make his wife holy.  Whatever he does he must do for his wife and not for himself.  The intention is to ensure that with their love and care for each other, no sin enters their home and their lives, so that they will both receive eternal life.

The Holy Family is a great example for us. Jesus was the Son of God the Father and Mary was the Mother of God the Son. Joseph was the only ordinary human and the least among the three. But Jesus and Mary did not rule over Joseph. They subjected themselves to Joseph in obedience to his every decision.

Ephesians 6:10-20
In Ephesians 5 Paul just finished giving us advice on how to live a holy family life, by loving each other with sacrificial love; love between man and wife, between parents and children, between masters and slaves.
But in Ephesians 6 Paul starts speaking of spiritual warfare.
The greatest battle field we have to stand on in life is the battle field of our own homes.  Jesus commanded us to carry our crosses faithfully every day (Luke 9:23) but the most difficult crosses which we have to carry may be in our own homes.   We may, therefore, sometimes find it more easier to practice our Christian faith faithfully outside our homes rather than inside.
Marriage was God's plan for bringing forth new life therefore family is what Satan hates because he is the author of death.

Therefore, if we have a difficult or unfaithful spouse, rebellious children, nagging in-laws, etc. let us remember that it is not our family members that are bad but it is Satan using our family members to force us to eat the forbidden fruit through quarrels, misunderstanding, accusations, blaming each other, etc. to drag us into his kingdom along with our families.\
Let us, therefore, ensure that we forgive each other as God forgives us, not with sarcastic apologies, but with genuine apologies from the heart.
It is not wrong to put on the full armour of God when we are outside our homes, but God wants us to put on His full armour first in our own homes.\
Spiritually healthy families together make a healthy Church.

### Holy Indifference

[![Holy Indifference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day349.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lreKo78BWI "Holy Indifference")

### Day 349 Work out your salvation

We are called to work out our salvation, as opposed to a passive I’ll do nothing but God will save me. Being a Christian means striving to be holy and do good works of mercy. Although our holiness will never be enough because of our fallen nature and the corrupt world we live in, God in His Mercy and Grace will purify us and welcome us into heaven.
So then, my beloved, obedient as you have always been, not only when I am present but all the more now when I am absent, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
13For God is the one who, for his good purpose, works in you both to desire and to work. Ph 2:12-13

God is on our side and God works in us with both desire(faith) and works. We need not fear for our God is the almighty one, everything on earth bows down to our God.
Rather, he emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.
9Because of this, God greatly exalted him
and bestowed on him the name
that is above every name,
10that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father. Ph 2:7-11

Our God is greater than anything we see, feel or experience. Jesus is Lord over all the earth and the heavens. We need not fear anything as long as we are humbly working out our salvation. Jesus will provide and protect us. Just as Paul was protected from the viper bites.
Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper, escaping from the heat, fastened on his hand.
4When the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must certainly be a murderer; though he escaped the sea, Justice has not let him remain alive.”
5But he shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.
6They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead but, after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god Acts 28:3-6

Remember Jesus promised that the disciples would pick up snakes with their hands and not be hurt.
“they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.” Mark 16:18
Let us know that even if we are in a situation where we have a viper in our hands and it bites us, Jesus will protect us. No venom can kill us because Jesus is in our hearts. We need to just trust in Jesus fully as there are bound to be attacks of the evil on our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 349 By Cynthia Dsilva

Philippians 1:6
*I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.*

In the old Covenant, God's people waited with joyful expectation for the first coming of the Lord. But in the new Covenant, most of God’s people are scared or anxious when they think of the second coming of the Lord and the final judgment, because they are not really sure if they are leading their lives according to God's Will or not and whether they have completed the mission for which they were sent to earth.

Paul was therefore assuring the Philippians, and us, that if we continue growing in holiness as well as working for the growth of God’s Kingdom, then it is not us working but the work of Christ dwelling in us.  Therefore, we don’t have to be anxious about whether or not we will complete our mission before the Lord’s parousia, because what Christ started doing in us, He will definitely finish before the last day, and if we are loyal to Him and allow Him to remain in us as long as we live then we will definitely be with him and share in His eternal glory.

Philippians 1:15-18
*Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill.  These proclaim Christ out of love, knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel;  the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment.  What does it matter? Just that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice.*

The Philippians did not have good relations with many people in their neighbourhood.  Even the two ladies, who were working with Paul to assist him in his preaching, had difficulty agreeing with each other (Philippians 4:2).

Although some were preaching the Gospel in Paul’s absence, all the preachers  were not trying to bring people to God out of love for Christ because they weren't leading holy lives themselves.

Some of the preachers were envious of Paul’s popularity and leadership role.  They started preaching because they wanted to grab Paul’s position and popularity for themselves while he was in prison.

Some of them were preaching for their own benefit, while some were preaching out of rivalry against each other, etc.  There were only a few who were genuinely preaching the Gospel out of love for Christ.   But whatever reason the preachers were preaching for, Paul was happy that they were bringing people to God.  Regarding their personal character they would have to deal with God directly.
And so it is with us.

When we do good works with ungodly motives, the beneficiary will definitely benefit from it but our heavenly reward will depend on our motive.

Philippians 1:21\
*For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.*

Christian life is a win-win life because life is Christ and death is gain.
If we receive the Body of Christ in a state of grace at all times (1 Corinthians 11:27) then we will have divine life within us, therefore Satan will not have power over our souls, and if we die with divine life within us then Satan will not be able to claim our souls, and our souls will be raised on the last day (John 6:54).

So, whether we are living or dead in this world, it is a win-win situation because our souls will always be in the custody of Christ (John 10:27-28), therefore, we should not be afraid of death.

Paul was anxiously waiting for his natural death so that he could be with Christ for eternity but God wanted him to stay on earth for a while to accomplish the mission assigned to him (Philippians 1:22-24).

Paul and the other Apostles are not the only ones who had a mission to accomplish. Every Christian has a mission to accomplish for the Lord.
Let us therefore ask the Lord, without delay, to help us know what our mission is, so that we can get busy with helping in the growth of God’s Kingdom as long as we are here on earth while we also maintain our holiness.

Philippians 2:1-8
If we are the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head, then the body must be in sync with the head.

Our body is an analogy for our souls.
If our body does not obey what our head/mind tells us to do, then our body suffers in many ways and we may have to see a doctor for physical treatment. We tell him our symptoms and he prepares/prescribes medicine for us along with some lifestyle changes.

Similarly, if we do not obey what Christ wants us to do, then we suffer in many ways due to our sins and we may have to see a spiritual doctor (the priest) for spiritual treatment.  We tell him our symptoms (sins) and he prescribes some lifestyle changes (penance).  Thereafter he prepares the medicine (the Body of Christ / Communion) for us, to be consumed regularly.

To begin thinking like Christ, Paul is not asking us to move mountains or build projects.  Paul advises us to start with baby steps. He just wants us to do, what we do for others, with love and concern for them, starting with our own families and the people around us, and not by selfishly pursuing our own interests or by looking at others as lower than us.\
Additionally, we must read the scriptures every day (the old and the new).
At all times we must humble ourselves and use whatever power or authority we have in our hands, to serve others, just as Christ did.

Unlike the first Adam, who in his pride grasped at being like God without God, the new Adam (Jesus) humbled himself to become a slave, obedient even unto death on the Cross (Romans 5:12–17). In this He has shown sinners, each one of us, the way back to the Father. We can only come to God to serve in His vineyard (the Church), by having that same attitude as Christ.

Philippians 2:12
*Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.*

Paul was aware that his Baptism was not sufficient for salvation.\
Salvation is an ongoing lifetime process.
We were saved when we were baptized, we are saved during our lifetime whenever we receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, and we will eventually be saved if we die in a state of grace.

We must, therefore, be alert to sin at all times and keep ourselves purified as long as we live.

### Day 350 Doers of the Word, not hearer only.

We are called to be not just hearers of the Word but doers as well.
Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.

23For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his own face in a mirror.
24He sees himself, then goes off and promptly forgets what he looked like. James 1:23-24

Imagine going in front of the mirror in the morning and not combing your hair, it seems foolish, doesn’t it. But if we read God’s Word and commands and do not act upon them then we are fooling ourselves.
In the same way, if we say that we have faith that can move mountains but do not have works to prove it, then our faith is dead.
The formula “Believe in your heart and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and you will be saved” is not complete.
Although Faith is necessary but faith alone is not enough, works are needed to demonstrate our faith. We are not hearers only but doers as well. In reality, we are not saved only by faith and works but are saved by grace.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day,
16and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well,” but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is it?
17So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead. James 2:14-17

So the next time someone tells you faith only saves, ask them to search the Bible for the words “Faith alone” the only verse that will come up is James 2:17 which said faith by itself is dead.

It is easy to hear God’s word and love it, but hard to act on it. We may feel overwhelmed or powerless to be doers of the Word. Let me encourage you and remind you that God empowers us and we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

I have the strength for everything through him who empowers me. Phil 4:13

And we can rest assured that God will supply all our needs in accordance to the glorious riches we have in Christ Jesus.

My God will fully supply whatever you need, in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. Phil 4:19

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

James 1:12-18
God is a Tester, not a Tempter.
God does not tempt us but He does test us by allowing trials and tribulations in our lives.
Temptation is meant to deceive us and lure us into sin, which is the work of the devil, and we can overcome temptations only if our faith, love and trust in God is strong.

*Why is it necessary for God to test us?*
God does not test us for Him to know the result.  He already knows the result before we were born. God tests us so that we can be aware of our spiritual weaknesses and so that we can work on improving in those areas. The trials and tribulations (terminal exams) are meant to help us grow stronger in our faith and love and to prepare us spiritually for our final exam before we leave this world.

James 1:19-27
Our inability to listen to others arises from lack of patience. We are always eager to speak; we always try to give suggestions to others even when they don't ask us for it. Sometimes we have selective hearing. We listen only to the part of the conversation where we can give our knowledge, our opinion, our solutions, our judgement or our reply.  If something we have heard touches our pride, we choose to activate our anger and thereafter harsh words pour out of our mouth.

James is inviting us to listen attentively to others.  This means we must keep our eyes and ears open and maintain our silence, speaking only when it is necessary.

Sometimes we like to talk too much about our own problems, achievements and success but we don't have patience or interest to listen to the problems, achievements or successes of others.

James is advising us to learn to control our tongue, which is the cause of most of our sins, and to focus more on generosity towards the destitute, giving preference to widows and orphans.

James 2:1-9
James addresses one of the major problems in the early Church, which was the issue of discrimination. People were being grouped according to their wealth, possessions, power and status in the secular world.  As a result the less fortunate ones were being ignored and treated with disrespect while the successful ones were given more attention and treated with great respect.

As Christians, we must avoid giving importance to people just because they have a higher material value or status in life, because Jesus gave His life for every human, irrespective of their caste, religion, colour, status, power, etc.

Let us therefore check ourselves and see if we too have been making the same mistake as the early Christians did. If we have, then let us change that from today and start giving more attention to the less fortunate ones (the poor, the needy, the old age homes, etc.) while we treat all humans as equals.

James 2:14-17
James was reminding us of the words of Jesus (Matthew 7:24).
Jesus is not happy with only lip service from us.  He wants to see our works which prove our words (Matthew 25).  We cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbors or if we ignore our neighbors who are in need of help.

We have been created for a purpose and our mission on earth must begin with faith in Christ.  But faith without works is dead faith (James 2:17) because faith without works is only lip service.  Our faith must be tested, and we can prove our faith (belief and trust) in God only by our works (Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 14:12; 20:12–13; 22:12).  Part of our mission on earth is to do good works for Christ by doing good works for others, not for ourselves.

*What is “works”?*
James was speaking about all good works accomplished in Christ.
Loving and trusting God and obeying His commandments, even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations, is called “works.”

James 2:24
Salvation is not through Faith alone.
We enter the Kingdom of God (the Church) through faith but we will be judged by our works.

Philippians 3:2
*Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!*

Paul’s main enemies were the Jewish Christians who refused to accept the decision of the first council in Jerusalem that the gentile converts need not be circumcised.  Those Jewish Christian opponents were creating chaos in the Churches by spreading the erroneous message that for a Christian to be saved they must also follow the Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher food, animal sacrifices, etc.).

Philippians 3:4–11
Before his encounter with Jesus, Paul was puffed up with pride because he was circumcised, he was an Israelite, he belonged to one of the tribes of Israel, he was highly educated in the Mosaic Law under the patronage of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel, and above all, he had zeal for God. Like all Pharisees and Scribes, He believed that he was doing everything that was required to receive eternal life because he obeyed the Mosaic Law word-to-word. But unfortunately there was no feeling in his heart for humans.

Paul was highly educated but he couldn't see the truth.  He wanted to eradicate Christianity, not realizing that he was trying to eradicate the only source of eternal life.
Most of the time our education tends to make us aggressive and arrogant if we are not alert to sin and the devil's tricky ways.

After Paul had an encounter with Christ, he later realized that all his earthly achievements were just trash, compared to the glory that Jesus had offered him, even though the road to eternal life was going to be full of rocks and thorns.

After his encounter with Jesus, Paul wanted to forget his past, he wanted to forget Saul and try his best to follow Christ as Paul, not as Saul. It was the risen Christ within him who made it possible for Paul to face the suffering which he went through thereafter.

Like Paul, we too can sometimes swell up with pride because we are more educated than others, or because we are more successful in this life than others.  But if there is no God in our hearts and in our homes, and if we have no feelings for others, then all our achievements in this life are of no value in God’s eyes.  God is not interested in our success in this life.  God blesses us with earthly success so that we can use it to reach out to the people around us, specially the less fortunate ones.
Following Christ should not be limited to just reading the Bible, attending daily worship / Mass, fasting and praying.  Jesus wants us to open our eyes and ears and help the people around us with love, as if they were our close family members, specially the less fortunate ones.

### Draw Near to God

[![Draw Near to God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day351.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dCcGGslB9lQ "Draw Near to God")

### Day 351 Words have power

We need to remember that our words have power because we are children of God. God created everything with just a word, “let there be light.” James reminds us that we who are teachers should realize that we speak God’s word and hence have to avoid any other bad speech.
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,
2for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also. James 3:1,2

There are 3 striking examples given to demonstrate the importance of the good use of the tongue.

1. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.
2. It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination wishes.
3. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.
   For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
   8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. James 3:3-8

It is very hard as to tame the tongue, we can easily slander, gossip, lie, curse, speak rudely, angry words, insults… Let us pray for the grace to control our tongue, so we will have the strength to control the whole body.
If we take some time to ponder on our speech we may fell as though we are hugging a cactus. But we have to come to terms with reality and draw near to God, for only with God’s strength can we control our tongue.

Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds.
9Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.
10Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you. James 4:8-10

As we draw near to God we come to a realization of our sin and want to cleanse our hands, hearts and tongue. If we humble ourselves before the Lord, Jesus will lift us up.
Let all our words be holy and positive, for our words have power. Let us speak blessings on our children everyday. Let praise be on our lips all the days of our life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 351 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 3:1
*Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.*
When we become teachers of the faith it is possible that we can swell up with pride because we may see ourselves as better than those who we teach.  As teachers of faith it is important that we ourselves practice what we teach others.  We must accept correction from others when we are wrong.

God gave us a tongue to praise and worship Him, not to abuse, curse or speak ill of those who are made in the likeness of God.\
Let us learn to use our tongue to praise and worship God and to bring happiness in the lives of others.
Let us not be quick to find fault with others or to make negative comments about them.
Let us learn to use our tongue to speak well of others, to remember their good deeds, and to express gratitude.
Let us learn to use our tongue to ask for forgiveness from those whom we offend and to forgive those who offend us.
Let us pray to God to help us practice self-control and to use our tongue wisely.

James 3:13-18
As James explains, worldly wisdom is reflected in covering up our sins or tactfully justifying ourselves for a wrong or evil action.  By justifying our ungodly actions we are actually saying that evil is right.
Worldly wisdom causes us to misuse others, specially the less fortunate ones, for our benefit.
Worldly wisdom causes us to pretend that we are perfect and that we have knowledge of everything. We pretend that we are what we are not. We believe that everything we say and do is right, and we refuse to accept corrections.
Worldly wisdom causes us to work for the devil in the name of God.
Thus worldly wisdom causes us to live spiritually bipolar lives.

James advises us to show godly wisdom through our actions and by living good and honest lives.

James 5:7-10
Patience is a virtue which we must practice because we have to wait for God to answer our prayers. While we practice patience we get spiritually healed.
We must have patience before we draw a negative conclusion about a person or a situation.\
We must have patience when dealing with negative people, specially with those who provoke us.

The sibling of patience is time. They collaborate with each other to solve our difficulties or problems and the long wait helps us to understand the situation better.
Let us ask the Lord to give us the grace to be patient at all times, and specially during our difficult times.

James 5:14-15
James was talking about the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick with holy oil.
But James was not introducing this Sacrament as a new procedure.

He was telling the people that they must not let this already existing opportunity go waste.

He was reminding the people to call the Priests when someone was in danger of dying, so that maximum souls could be saved.
The Apostles continued anointing the sick with holy oil, as Jesus had taught them before the Resurrection (Mark 6:13).\
Unlike baptism, this anointing must be administered only by a Priest ("Presbyters" in Greek / elders) (James 5:14) for the Sacrament to be effective, that is, for God's grace to flow through it.

James 5:16
*Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.*
Before the Resurrection the people’s sins were forgiven by God (Jesus) through a Priest (Jesus) (Mathew 9:2-8).
After the Resurrection Jesus commissioned His Apostles/Priests to forgive sins (John 20:21-23), but the grace was given to them only after Pentecost Sunday.

James was not introducing the Sacrament of Reconciliation as a new procedure.  He was just reminding the people of what they already knew about but were probably neglecting.

When we confess our sins we are not really sharing our dirty little secrets with God, because He already knows everything we think, say and do, whether good or bad.  Instead, we are humbling ourselves before God and opening the door to the healing power of His mercy which He wants to give us but cannot, unless we ask for it through His anointed priest.  Confessing our sins to a Priest teaches us to practice humility, which is the virtue that removes Pride, the source of sin.

The words of absolution which come from Jesus through the Priest, are not just the babbling of a clergyman or the performance of a ritual.  Those words are more powerful than when God said “let there be light ….” (Genesis 1:3), and when Jesus said “Lazarus come out” (John 11:43), because creation and Lazarus were not meant to last forever, but our souls will, when we are spiritually healed.
While we spend so much time and effort to keep our physical bodies clean, let us not forget to give regular attention to our spiritual hygiene also.

Colossians 1:24-27
It was the ancient belief that suffering comes only to sinners so the Colossian Christians could not understand why Paul was going through suffering even though he was an Apostle.  Paul was explaining to them why he, and all Christians, must go through suffering.

Paul earlier mentioned that all the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily (Colossians 1:18-19).  If Christ is fully divine then He cannot be lacking in His afflictions or suffering of the Cross.

However, if a sinner's love can cover a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8), then God's infinite love can cover an infinite multitude of sins. Therefore, there cannot be anything lacking in the sacrifice of Christ.  And as Paul himself said, the Blood of the Cross had the power to reconcile, not only humanity but, the entire cosmos to God (v. 20).

But Paul was not talking about the suffering of Jesus on the Cross. He was talking about his own participation (v. 24) which was lacking in the suffering of Christ (Matthew 16:24).

On Good Friday Jesus inaugurated His redemptive suffering and afflictions with the intention that it will continue in His mystical Body through us (the Christians on earth) which is His Church so that He could be united with His bride (the Church).  Therefore, when we (the Christians) suffer, inspite of leading holy lives, we do not suffer in vain.  Rather, we suffer in union with Christ for our own salvation and for the salvation of others.

Let us, therefore, not waste our sufferings by pitying ourselves or complaining or retaliating, etc.  Let us suffer willingly while we offer all our sufferings (aches & pains, sickness, financial problems, legal problems, etc.) to Christ as penance for our sins as well as for the sins of our offenders (if any) or the sins of those who we feel are in need of being saved.

### Day 352 Suffering unjustly

Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.1 Pet 2:18

Most people are either complaining about work or their boss, mostly for the right reasons. Bosses can be very hard to deal with as some of them are really corrupt, they are seeking their own gain. However, as Christians, we should be subject to them whether they are good or bad. Now does Jesus want us to be always under the yoke of hard work, absolutely not. God will give you the right job and boss to benefit you. We should always pray for our boss and job and do it to the best of our ability, God will bless us and we will find fulfillment for the dignity of work comes from God.

For whenever anyone bears the pain of unjust suffering because of the consciousness of God, that is a grace.

20But what credit is there if you are patient when beaten for doing wrong? But if you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good, this is a grace before God.
21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps. 1 Pet 2:19-22

If we suffer unjustly because of the consciousness of God we can rest assured we are under grace. God will give us the strength to suffer because Jesus suffered unjustly and set an example for us.
“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.” When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly. 1Pet 2:22-23

So whether we suffer justly or unjustly let us remember to unite our suffering to the suffering of Jesus. When we unite our suffering to Jesus’ suffering our suffering becomes redemptive and we receive a blessing, in fact it is a privilege to suffer unjustly. However if we only suffer unjustly then it may turn to abuse, so we need to make people aware if they treat you poorly. Take a stand for what is right, but also accept your cross until the time it is resolved.

May the Holy Spirit lead 🙏

### BIAY Day 352 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 2:20-25
Circumcision was meant only for the natural male descendants of Abraham but Baptism is meant for everyone, old and young, Jews and gentiles.  God wants every human to belong to His family from the 8th day of their birth so that they can be brought into a relationship with Him and thereby start receiving sanctifying graces.

In the old Covenant all male descendants of Abraham had to be circumcised on the 8th day of their birth even though the old Covenant could not sanctify their souls.
But the new Covenant is more powerful than the old one, and therefore Peter extends the invitation for baptism to adults and children alike, so that they can be brought into the new Covenant without delay.

Three thousand were baptized after hearing Peter's sermon because Peter spoke with the power of the Holy Spirit.

*By his stripes we are healed.*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus we are spiritually and physically healed, but the carrying out of that healing process happens in different ways and at different times.
Original sin is cleansed and we are restored to a state of sanctifying grace through baptism. Our souls are redeemed but our bodies are not.  And even our souls are not immediately restored and perfected.  The disorder of concupiscence remains, that is, the "fomes peccati" (in Latin) or “tendency to sin” that afflicts us until we attain our ultimate goal of final salvation at the end of our lives.

The sanctifying graces which we receive through the sacraments are not only a source of healing and restoration, but they are a summons to spiritual battle.  They enter us into our time of testing that will lead us to our full and final redemption, that will include not only the full and final redemption of our souls, but also "the redemption of our bodies" (Romans 8:23), but only if we are faithful unto death (Revelation 2:10).

Why?
That is because our bodies are not redeemed yet in any sense. This is unlike our souls that have already experienced redemption, but are in a process of redemption / salvation / justification that will reach its completion at the end of life.

When God chooses to heal our bodies, whenever we are physically sick, that is also a participation in the healing that came to us through the Cross.  But it is temporary and points to the more important healing of the soul, as we see in the case of the paralytic when Jesus healed the soul first and then the body (Matthew 9:2-6). The ultimate and absolute healing of the body comes only at the end of time for all humans, with the exception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who did not need any healing of body and soul.

In other words, it means that the healing is not automatic. The healing medicine was prepared by Jesus, spiritually, when He received all His wounds during His passion and death, and also by the holy life He led, but since the time of the Resurrection it has been made available to us for our healing, first during Baptism and thereafter only when we pray and when we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, during which time physical healing may or may not happen but spiritual healing definitely happens.

Colossians 3:5-10
Old person / old self / old man refers to the first Adam and new person / new self / new man refers to the new Adam (Jesus).
The first Adam's sin caused humanity to receive damaged souls which weakened our conscience and therefore we fall into temptations easily.
The new Adam (Jesus) gave us a renewable Covenant so that we, who are baptized, can renew the Covenant whenever we break it, thereby allowing us to restore the divine life within us which gives us the spiritual strength to resist evil and keeps us ready for eternal life.
Our fallen nature can accept evil without any effort, but to resist evil we need spiritual strength which is powerful and we get that power from the sacraments.

Colossians 3:12-21
Divine authority is reflected in human authority. We have 3 persons in the Trinity with God the Father above all but all three are always in unity with each other. Authority does not mean that the subordinates must be misused or abused by their superiors. Authoritative positions are given to us by God so that we can serve others, and not to expect the subordinates to serve us.  Subordinates are given to us by God to assist us in serving others.

An authoritative position gives the person the authority to make rules to enforce discipline, to ensure that everyone obeys the rules, to deal with those who violate rules, to make decisions, to organize things, etc. whether it is in a household, in the Church, at our work place, etc.

By humbling Himself and washing the feet of His disciples (John 13:5), Jesus, the King of all kings, gave us an example of how a person in authority must act.  Let us follow His example.

### Day 353 A gentle and calm disposition

True beauty is not found in fashion, accessories, hairstyles or jewelry. Many people pay to a lot of money on designers cloths and accessories. It's true they may be in fashion but believing that it makes you more beautiful is a lie.
Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,
4but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God. 1 Pet 3:3,4

True beauty is from a gentle and calm disposition, internal beauty of the person is more important than looks.
A calm internal disposition is hard to come by in this disturbing world. But it’s not impossible to have it if can cast all our care unto the Lord.
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.1 Pet 5:7

The God who created everything we see cares about us, so we need not worry about anything, just stay close to God. God will take care of all our needs. We need to just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and we will be exalted in due time.

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet 5:6

We also have to be on the watch because the devil our enemy is prowling around looking for who he can devour, he comes to rob steal and destroy.
Let us stay close to God who cares for us, we will be protected if we stay in God’s shadow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 353 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 3:1-2
*Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives’ conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.*

A woman must lead a devout Christian life, following God's commandments faithfully, so that even if her husband does not obey God's Word, the splendour of her Christian life will draw her husband towards Christ.
And Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the best example of a faithful and godly wife.

1 Peter 3:9-10
*But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.*

A priest is a man chosen by God to offer the prescribed sacrifices on the Altar, in the Temple during worship.

*Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people.*

To be "God’s own people" means to be in a Covenant relation with God.  Therefore, to be "not the people of God" means to be outside the Covenant of God (Hosea 2:23b).
Thus the Church is the new Temple as well as the new Israel (Galatians 6:16).

The Theology of Peter's first letter to the Church is of a Church in exile, a Church on a journey, a Church that is moving from this world to the world to come.   And just as the first Israel was taken out of Egypt and thereafter became sojourners, moving through the desert to the promised land, so also the believers to whom Peter wrote this letter, were wandering in the earthly exile and moving towards the heavenly promised land.

Family, married life, good works, prayers, etc.... are all spiritual sacrifices.

1 Peter 3:17
*For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.*

There are 3 reasons why God allows suffering in our lives:

1. To remind us to confess our sins of commission or omission and ask God for forgiveness (1 Peter 4:15).
2. To spiritually heal the good ones (1 Peter 4:14, 16 & 19).
3. To glorify the holy ones, as in the case of Jesus and His mother.
   Whenever we or our families go through suffering, besides praying for a solution or healing, we must focus on making a thorough examination of our conscience and confess any unconfessed sins.

1 Peter 3:19-20
*In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient while God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water.*

This was the last phase of the Messianic mission of Jesus.

Purgatory is a temporary condition for a soul that has passed individual judgment but still has the temporal component of sins to atone for before attaining the beatific vision.

Purgatory / Sheol / Hades is like a spiritual hospital (or preparation room) where the venial sins of the righteous ones are purged after they die so that their souls can be covered with white robes before they stand in front of a divine God.

The souls of the righteous ones of the old Covenant were preserved in the same or similar place for their venial sins to be purged until the holy Blood would be shed and the Gospel would be preached to them by Jesus because, although their earthly bodies had perished, their spirits were still alive (example: story of the rich man and Lazarus).

After His death, Jesus went down to Purgatory and preached the Gospel to the righteous ones of the old Covenant who had fallen asleep and thereafter, as prophesied (Daniel 7:22 & 27), they became saints (Mathew 27:52).  The cloud of witnesses (Hebrews 12:1) are those saints in Heaven (Hebrews 11:4-38).

In the ongoing liturgical celebration in Heaven (Revelation) all the angels and saints together pray for the saints on earth because our damaged human souls are in great need of God’s blessings.

While we owe it to our children to hand down the faith to them, we do owe it to our deceased parents, ancestors and other family members to pray for their souls to rest in eternal peace.
The saints in Heaven intercede for us continuously (Revelation).  By His death, Jesus reconciled God and man and thereby populated Heaven with saints and thus He also reconciled angels and saints.

On 1st November the Church celebrates the feast of all saints who are already in Heaven, and on 2nd November the Church dedicates the day to pray for the souls of all those saints who are waiting their turn in Purgatory.

1 Peter 3:21
*This prefigured baptism, which now saves you.*
Baptism is not the only time when we were saved.
Salvation is a lifetime process.
Christians are first saved (from going to Hell) when they are baptized, which is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit because Jesus paid the price by shedding His blood on the Cross, 2,000 years ago.
Christians are in the process of being saved during their lifetime when they pick up their crosses and follow Christ faithfully and when they faithfully follow the fundaments of their faith (Repentance, Sharing and Serving).
Christians hope to be saved, if they have endured to the end of their lives.

*It is not a removal of dirt from the body but an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.*
The great flood, which took place during the time of Noah, was only a symbol of baptism.
The rituals for washing which were introduced in the old Covenant from the time of Moses, were also symbols of the new Covenant baptism but they were also meant to remove dirt from the body as an analogy for the soul.\
But the baptism of Jesus is more powerful than its symbols.

The baptism of Jesus saves us from Hell because it washes away spiritual dirt (sins), to purify the soul, and thereby restores divine life within us, which in turn provides us with sanctifying graces to perfect our souls, without which we cannot enter Heaven.

*Water without the Trinity* washes physical dirt because water by itself does not have any power.
*Water + the Trinity* washes spiritual dirt (sins) because the water now has the power of God. The power of the Trinity in the presence of water is sufficient to erase the past sins of a person.

Once we are baptized, we can start receiving the regular sacraments (Reconciliation & Eucharist) to keep our souls constantly sanctified as long as we live.

1 Peter 5:8
*Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.*
The devil roars like a lion to scare people into believing that he is the lion of Judah whereas Jesus is the true lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5).

1 Thessalonians 2:11
*As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children.*
This is one of the reasons why we call our priests "Father" because they are our spiritual fathers.
