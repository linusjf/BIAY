### Day #214 Can a woman forget her nursing child?

The love of a mother is the strongest human love that anyone can experience (although there can be exceptions). A mother‚Äôs love is so great that she is ready to sacrifice her own joy for the joy of the children. She will do anything it takes to see her children succeed. We can all relate to the warm love our mothers showed us, and the care and comfort we found in her bosom. Mother‚Äôs love is demonstrated in the lovely food they made, the clean house they kept, and the hard work they did in the house and at the office as well. Mothers don‚Äôt ever take sick days; they are constantly working to keep the family happy. The love of a mother for her newborn is admirable, she will keep up all night to ensure the baby is happy. Although the love of a mother is great, there can be times when she will not be the mother she is called to be. Mothers are human as well and can have many flaws. Even if a mother will forsake her infant, God will never abandon us or forsake us.
But Zion said, ‚ÄúThe Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.‚Äù Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. Is 49:14-16
The Lord called me before I was born, while I was in my mother‚Äôs womb he named me. Is 49:1
The Lord is our true parent, He had named us even when we were in our mother‚Äôs womb. The Lord has inscribed us on the palms of His hands. We are truly loved and admired by our God. Even if everyone on earth leaves us if we are abandoned by our parents, children, friends, spouse, family, and siblings the Lord will never leave us. We can always trust God to be there for us, even if human beings leave us.
The best place to be is in the arms of Abba father. We sometimes overthink or overanalyze our faith, we just need to be held by God sometimes. He is our father and we are His Children. We will not be forgotten.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 49:1-4
The *servant of the Lord* is Jesus as well as Israel, therefore what was true for Jesus and the old Israel is also true for the new Israel (the Christians).

The Lord plans our mission on earth long before we are born and sends us to the earth to carry out that mission while we also earn our living, just as it was with Jesus.
Let us therefore ask the Lord to help us know what our mission is and surrender ourselves to Him so that He can carry out that mission through us, as He wills.
Let us glorify the Lord by sharing the Word of God with the people around us, starting with our families, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.
Let us also glorify the Lord by loving and caring for everyone including our enemies.

Let us allow God to continue working through us even though we cannot see the fruit of our efforts in the midst of an evil world.

### Day #215 How beautiful are the feet of the messenger who announces peace

Good news is always something people look forward to, whether it is an appointment letter to your new job or acceptance to college, or to a sports team. We are eager to hear good news and always wait for the people who bring it to us. Of course, the biggest news to humanity is the promise of a redeemer, the announcement of salvation and the fact that God will reign over Zion is good news to the Israelites.
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns.‚Äù Is 51:7
However, the Israelites were expecting a King ‚Äì who would fight and destroy the nations that are keeping them captive. However God‚Äôs ways are not our ways, we will eventually be given Jesus who conquered with love. He did not come to destroy the people who were keeping Israelites' captives but to save them. He would come not to dominate and rule with force, but to submit himself even unto death, to show us 'the way of love' and 'the way of peace'.
Just as there were many who were astonished at him ‚Äîso marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals‚Äî 15 so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Is 51:14,15
He was the suffering servant, marred beyond recognition. Even though Jesus is God, He accepted torture at the hands of his creation. He loves us to the point where He took on our sins and our death. He suffered in our place so that we can be saved.
Your feet will be beautiful to this hurting world if you can carry this good news to them. The news that Jesus loves them dearly, even unto death.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Suffering Servant

[![The Suffering Servant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day216.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A86jWg7J1BI "The Suffering Servant")

### Day #216 By his bruises we are healed

When we get sick or hurt, we immediately turn to medicine and the doctors to cure us. The doctors can prescribe medicine, but healing is from the Lord. We are healed by Jesus, by his bruises we are healed. Medicine and faith go hand in hand ‚Äì doctors are a gift from God, our intelligence is from God, and advancement in science and technology is a blessing if we use it in accordance with God‚Äôs will. According to OT Jewish practice sin brought disease and poverty and prosperity and health were due to a holy life. This statement is true but not a hard and fast rule for every situation, for example, the holy saints suffered even though they did very little sin and a dodgy businessman becomes rich because of his corrupt ways. One thing is sure since God is just ‚ÄúSin brings punishment‚Äù however God does not want to punish us for life, he loves us and wants us to be whole. For a brief moment, He may forsake us, but with great compassion, he will comfort us.
For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. Is 53:7-8
Our Redeemer Jesus has carried our sins and diseases, he was stricken, wounded, and crushed for our transgressions. He that knew no sin, has taken on all the sins of every single person starting from Adam to the last person alive. We are healed because of Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross, by his bruises we are healed. Even though our sins should cause us sickness and punishment, Jesus took that suffering on himself. If we repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness, Jesus will not only forgive us our sins but also heal our bodies.
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain. When you make his life an offering for sin,
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Is 53:4-6, 10, 12
The promise that was given to Noah that the earth will never be destroyed again by a flood is extended to all humanity. In Jesus God promises that he will not be angry with us and the covenant of peace will not be removed. Even though the mountains may depart the hills be removed, God‚Äôs steadfast love will not depart from us. God looks at humanity through the lens of Jesus, we can always find God‚Äôs never-ending love and mercy in the cross of Jesus.
This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you. 10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us

### BIAY Day 216 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 53:3
\*He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\*

The Sanhedrin handed Jesus over to Pilate to be crucified so that He could be hung on a tree according to the punishment laid out for criminals (Deuteronomy 21:22-23), not realising that they were fulfilling the prophecy (Isaiah 53:4-5).
The people despised Jesus because it looked to them as if God was unhappy with Him and therefore He was being punished as He deserved, according to the blessings and curses under the Law (Deuteronomy 27:11-26 & 28:1-68).

Isaiah 53:5
\*By his stripes we are healed.\*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His hard life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus our souls are healed.

Isaiah 54:1-10
Our relationship with God is like the relationship of a bride and her groom.
Therefore, God sees sin as spiritual adultery because sin is not just the breaking of a law or commandment; it is the breaking of our relationship with God because when we sin we abandon Jesus and we hold the hand of Satan (our lover).

Exile is not a divorce. It is just a temporary separation between bride and her groom, who is her provider and protector, so that when the bride starts suffering due to separation she will realize her errors, repent and return to her groom.

God doesn't abandon us when we sin; it is we who abandon Him, and we can re-unite with Him only after we examine our conscience, repent, and confess our sins.
But it seems like it will be a long time before the people will realize their errors and repent because Isaiah assures them that, although the enemy has occupied their territory, their land will not be lost.  It will be recovered by their descendants.  They will be gathered together in the new Covenant when God will come down on earth to stay with His people (Matthew 28:20).

Sometimes our sufferings look like they are never going to end till we die and that may be true because in all that time God is waiting for us to repent and it is we who are delaying.

Ezekiel 14:13-14
\*When a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it human beings and animals, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they would save neither sons nor daughters; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord God.\*

This warning is not meant to cause us despair. It is meant to be an encouragement for us to pray and evangelize so that our culture does not reach the depths that is followed by judgment, as it happened with Sodom and Gomorrah.
Let us therefore get busy and spread the Word of God to everyone around us so that we can transform our ungodly culture into a godly one.

### The Everlasting Covenant

[![The Everlasting Covenant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day217.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6xWpWX7jF4c "The Everlasting Covenant")

### Day #217 For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples

God‚Äôs mercy is never ending and his steadfast love will not depart from us. However, in order to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness and mercy we need to seek Him, draw near to him and forsake our evil ways. We need to seek the Lord while he may be found, seek him while we are alive, and have an opportunity to repent ‚Äì once dead we cannot repent.
Draw near to God, while he is near, whenever you have an opportunity to pray ‚Äì use it and don‚Äôt lose it. If we return to the Lord he will have mercy on us and he will abundantly pardon us for any sin that we have committed. We may feel like running or hiding when we sin, but we should pray and return to God. For his ways are not our ways and his thoughts higher than our thoughts, just return to him while he may be found.
Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; 7 let the wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. Is 55
God‚Äôs thoughts are higher than our thoughts, we may condemn and put down people but God treats everyone equally. The people in Isaiah‚Äôs time would probably put down the Eunuch and the Foreigner. We should never put down people because of their sexual orientation or ethnicity. The church can determine who is in the state to receive communion(those who are in the state of grace) but as far as worshiping at Mass ‚Äì all are welcome, whether straight or otherwise, whether rich or poor, no matter what nationality one belongs to, the Catholic Church should welcome everyone, and so should every parish. The House of the Lord will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples. The church is a place not for ‚Äúsaints only‚Äù but a refuge for sinners too.
Do not let the foreigner joined to the Lord say, ‚ÄúThe Lord will surely separate me from his people‚Äù; and do not let the eunuch say, ‚ÄúI am just a dry tree.‚Äù 4 For thus says the Lord: To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, 5 I will give, in my house and within my walls, a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. Is 55
Let us remember to love the Word of God, for God‚Äôs word will never return empty, it always accomplishes its purpose. Just like the rain that comes down from heaven waters the earth and brings forth sprouts, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater. God‚Äôs word is alive and active, melting our hearts as we read it.
10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

‚ÄúThe Bible is the only book where the author is present whenever anyone reads it. ‚Äú

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 217 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 55:1-3
Earthly food makes us hungry again but the food which God was promising His people was supernatural food, the Bread of the Presence which was one of the key signs of the Covenant (Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:8).

In the new Covenant it is the Body of Christ / the consecrated bread, which is not for sale.

God was inviting His people to the Messianic banquet of the new Covenant where He would feed them with the Bread of life (the Body of Christ) which He gave to us in the Upper Room.

Isaiah 55:10‚Äì11
*For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.*

The rain that comes down is not unfruitful and it doesn't return back to where it came from. It waters the earth to give seed to the sower so that he can grow the crop and give bread to the eater to nourish his body.

Similarly, God's Word must bear fruit.  God does not withdraw His commands.
We cannot just read the Bible, meditate on the verses and close the book.  We must put God's Word into action.  God's Word says that we must love one another, and be kind and generous to others.  We must therefore go one step further and share God's love with others by loving them ourselves, being kind and generous with others without expecting any benefits, and living faithful Christian lives so that others will be drawn to Christ by the splendour of our lives.

When God speaks, His Word does something; it brings rain, it created the world in the beginning, it gave Abraham‚Äôs barren wife a son, etc. because God's Word has power and it must bear fruit.

Likewise, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" His words transformed the bread and wine into His mystical Body and Blood (Matthew 26:26-28).

When we are in union with the Lord, our words also have power because we are created in the likeness of God.
With our words we can bless others or with our words we can destroy others because death and life are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21).

Isaiah 56:3-7
In the old Covenant, foreigners and eunuchs were not allowed to enter the sacred areas of the Temple. Only Levites and the Aaronic priests could enter.
In the new Covenant, the priestly duties will be carried out by foreigners (non-Jews) who will be eunuchs (celebant).

This prophecy has been fulfilled in the Church where almost all priests are of non-Jewish blood and majority of them remain celebant by choice for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 19:12).

As Isaiah foretold, during worship we come to the Lord‚Äôs holy mountain, the heavenly Jerusalem, to offer the prescribed sacrifice, acceptable to God, at His Altar (Hebrews 12:22‚Äì24, 28).

### Day #218 True fasting

Sometimes when we fast we may have the wrong intentions like ‚Äúlosing weight for lent‚Äù or ‚Äújust to tell everyone we are fasting‚Äù. We may sometimes fast for an intention and are laser-focused on the intention ‚Äì although this is not entirely wrong, the most important thing about fasting is to change our souls. If fasting causes you to get nasty and act badly towards others, then the fasting is not serving its purpose. We can be overly focused on the bodily aspects of fasting instead of the spiritual.
‚ÄúWhy do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?‚Äù Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers. 4 Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high. 5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord? Is 58:3-5
True fasting should make us better people, we should do good things when we fast. Not just be hungry and angry. We should do charity and good works when we fast. That is why the Church recommends prayer, fasting, and almsgiving as a combined formula for lent. When we fast from food we should also fast from evil ‚Äì no pointing fingers or speaking evil. We should feed the hungry and satisfy the needs of the poor.
If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, 10 if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday. 11 The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail. 12 Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in. Is 58
When we do the right fasting with prayer and almsgiving, God will bless our fast and we will be satisfied, our needs will be met, we will grow strong, and we will be built up. We will be like a watered garden whose water never fails. Our light shall break forth like the dawn.
Let us fast, pray and love - with a genuine heart. Rend our hearts and not our garments. Jesus reminded us to look good when we fast and not let anyone know, but God who sees our hearts will bless us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 218 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 58:1-10
The people fasted from food and water, covered themselves with ashes and sackcloth, and followed all the rituals required for fasting but they didn‚Äôt change their hearts/conscience.  They continued oppressing their poor workers, quarrelling with each other and doing many things which were not pleasing to the Lord.
The people gave only lip service to God while their hearts were far from God.

We cannot fulfil our obligations only by following religious rituals.
God is deeply moved when the poor and needy ones cry out to Him for help and God is deeply hurt when we don't give true love to all the people in our lives.
God desires to share His love with all humanity and to help the less fortunate ones, but He needs the bodies of His baptized children to do all that.  And before we begin helping others, God wants us to change our hearts so that we do everything with love and not as an obligation.

The old Covenant people were clearly told once, and reminded several times, that God desires mercy towards the less fortunate ones (Deut. 15:11; Hosea 6:6) and Jesus also emphasized on the importance of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).

God doesn‚Äôt want our worship to be just an item ticked off on our checklist.  Therefore, fasting, praying, reading the Bible, attending daily/weekly Masses, etc. are of no use if we don‚Äôt have true love in our hearts for all the people in our lives and compassion for the poor and needy ones.

Ezekiel 18:4 & 20
God was speaking of spiritual death (Hell) (Ezekiel 18:4) because all humans are anyway subject to physical death.

No one is culpable for another person‚Äôs sins but when we commit mortal sins and we are comfortable living with them then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil‚Äôs aim is to destroy families because our earthly families were designed by God to be a symbol of the heavenly family.  Therefore, if we have committed a mortal sin then we must confess our sin immediately, without delay, and ensure that we live in obedience to God and keep our souls purified at all times.

If we are leading holy lives and suffering because of the sins of others, it is because we are members of the human family and our sins affect one another in various ways.  And God allows this to happen to us so that His grace can flow through us when we pray for our offenders while we are also spiritually healed.

Ezekiel 18:21-28
For a Christian, God's condition for judgement may seem fair, and so it is, but for the ancient Israelites it was an unfair judgment.

The ancient Israelites believed that they would receive eternal life if they lived righteous lives for a longer time, even if they  ended up dying in sin, and not according the state of their souls when they died. So, according to them, receiving or losing eternal life depended upon which kind of life they lived on earth for a longer time, that is, righteous or unrighteous.
Therefore, the people were complaining because they found God‚Äôs judgement to be unfair.

Let us check if we also believe what those ancient Israelites believed or whether we accept God's judgement as fair and just.

### Separation from God

[![Separation from God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day219.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8q5usBJOvC8 "Separation from God")

### Day #219 Growing little by little makes one stronger

Many people dream to win the lottery, especially those who have a lot of debts. We see poor people spending their money on lottery tickets. Most people will never win big prizes and those who actually win the jackpot will not know how to handle the big money.
Research shows that Lottery winners are more likely to declare bankruptcy within three to five years than the average American. What‚Äôs more, studies have shown that winning the lottery does not necessarily make you happier or healthier.
This proverb sheds wisdom on this aspect of our lives.
Wealth hastily gotten will dwindle, but those who gather little by little will increase it. Prov 13:11
Winning a lot of money won't make us rich, money will usually will dwindle pretty soon. For people are not prepared for it and they don‚Äôt know what to do with the money. Of course, there could be expectations that people have managed their finances well after winning a lottery.
On the other hand, one who slowly accumulates their wealth will know the value of money and will spend it wisely. That is why rich parents are advised to give little money to their kids else they will be spoiled.
The struggle that we face to climb the ladder of progress is good for us, it will teach us to be humble and wise in our spending. A lot of money will never make anyone happy, they may be happy for a little bit but will soon get bored. True happiness is in the process of struggling and growing.
It‚Äôs the same with our faith life, we cannot suddenly expect to grow and be given all the gifts. We will not know how to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit, that is why we need to slowly discover them. We need to struggle and journey so that we know the value of our spiritual gifts and our faith life. We need to walk daily with the Lord, we need to learn how to deny ourselves and slowly grow. If we fall we should get up and try again, never get disappointed but ‚Äúkeep On keeping ON‚Äù. May we receive the strength to follow the Lord closely, every day.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 219 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 59:1-2
*The Lord‚Äôs hand is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.  Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.*

When we confess our sins to the priest and our sins are forgiven, the barrier between God and us is removed and we are reconciled with God.

Therefore, if our prayers have not been answered for a long time, we need to examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to God, or not.  If not, then we need to repent and correct our errors.

### Prophecy Fulfilled

[![Prophecy Fulfilled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day220.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uUDXjh-XtUU "Prophecy Fulfilled")

### Day #220 The oil of gladness instead of mourning

At the start of Jesus' public ministry, he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; 2 to proclaim the year of the Lord‚Äôs favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; 3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion‚Äî to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. Is 61:1-3
Jesus read from Isaiah, and when he finished reading it.
‚ÄúAnd he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù Luke 4: 20,21
We have such a blessing in Jesus, God with us ‚Äì Emmanuel. Jesus came to bring good news to us the oppressed, He came to bind up the brokenhearted ‚Äì God is close to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34). Jesus came to set up free from sin and death, we were captives to sin we were prisoners to death ‚Äì there is no salvation for us without Jesus as we are sinful people. Jesus came to proclaim the year of favor ‚Äì instead of God‚Äôs vengeance Jesus brought us comfort. God does not deal with us according to our sins, He gives us a garland instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.
We are called to be a people of Praise and celebration. We should be rejoicing because of what Jesus has done for us. By His death and resurrection Jesus cloths us with righteousness and with garments of salvation.
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. Is 61:10
Jesus clothes us in garments of holiness, by the blood of His sacrifice. We are called to the wedding banquet of the Eucharist where the Bridegroom - Jesus rejoices over His bride the Church.
For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. Is 62:5
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 220 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 62:1-5
The bride will have a name change after marriage.
Most communities follow this tradition after marriage. But this is only a reflection of our spiritual marriage to Jesus during Mass in the new Covenant.
After her marriage with God, the new name of Jerusalem (the bride/the Church) will be "married/Mrs." ("Beulah" in Hebrew).  She will no longer be called abandoned / forsaken ("Azubah" in Hebrew) or barren / desolate ("Shemamah" in Hebrew) because after her marriage with God (the Son) during Mass she will have a spouse (Jesus) and she will go forth and evangelize to increase and multiply and fill the Church with souls.

Therefore, whenever we go to Church to attend Mass/the marriage feast of the Lamb, we must always dress modestly, as is also required of a bride, because we, the brides of Christ, are going to Church to marry the Holy King.

### Day #221 There is none to stand in the breach before God

We read about this pitiful condition of the Israelites in exile. The prophets who are supposed to be God‚Äôs mouthpiece are speaking as they like, they are giving out messages that they did not receive, they speak of false visions. The people in the land are practicing extortion and committing robbery, the poor are oppressed and the needy neglected.
Its prophets have smeared whitewash on their behalf, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‚ÄúThus says the Lord God,‚Äù when the Lord has not spoken. 29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the alien without redress. 30 And I sought for anyone among them who would repair the wall and stand in the breach before me on behalf of the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. 31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; I have returned their conduct upon their heads, says the Lord God. Eze 22: 28-31
There is no one to stand in the breach and intercede for these people. No one, not even one is found to pray for the nation.
This seems the case with the world even today, sin, violence and Godlessness are very common, and people are losing their faith. We need leaders to speak the truth to the people, not just being poetically correct but being a mouthpiece of the Lord. We need "prayer warriors" to stand in the gap between mankind and God and pray for this world. Just like Abraham prayed for the city of Sodom, we should plead to the Lord for our cities even to the very last person ‚Äì even if there is one righteous person the Lord will save the whole city.
We are not alone in the breech; Jesus is with us carrying one side of the yoke. Jesus is the great interceder who not only prays for the people but also sacrificed himself for our sins.
33 Who will bring any charge against God‚Äôs elect? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us Rom 8:33,34
Jesus is at the right hand of the Father, praying for us and interceding for us, we just need to partner with Jesus in prayer, praying for the world to change.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day #222 Indifferent toward God

The prophet Ezekiel is called to act out the prophecy in a very real way, he is also called the performance arts prophet. Because he not only prophecies with his words He also acts out/performs actions so that the Israelites will vividly remember the prophesies when it comes to pass.
The Lord will take away the prophet Ezekiel‚Äôs wife, the delight of his eye, the woman he truly loved. When someone loses their life partner, they would go into mourning and feel as though everything is lost, especially if the death is sudden. Everyone knew that Ezekiel loved his wife and just could not understand why he was not mourning for her. He was enacting what the Lord asked him to do, this was just a foreshadowing of what the Israelites would do when the temple would be destroyed. The temple was the pride of Israel, the delight of their eye.
15 The word of the Lord came to me: 16 Mortal, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down. 17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
19 Then the people said to me, ‚ÄúWill you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting this way?‚Äù 20 Then I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me: 21 Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and your heart‚Äôs desire; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword. 22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another. 24 Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; you shall do just as he has done. When this comes, then you shall know that I am the Lord God. Eze 24:15-24
This indifference towards God can be seen even today in our generation. We do not seem to be moved when we see people doing evil things. Even if God and Holy things are desecrated, we tend to not even bother. When there is evil within the church we just want to brush it under the carpet and. When there are evil laws passed, we just ignore them. When our kids don‚Äôt go to church we don‚Äôt correct them. When people are living scandalous lives we are okay with it. We cannot be indifferent to the poor, the hungry, the evildoers. We need to take a stand for Christ in this ungodly world. We cannot be indifferent but have to be concerned and pray for this world. We cannot be lukewarm, since we are neither hot nor cold the Lord is about to spit us out of His mouth.
15 ‚ÄúI know your works; you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot. 16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.Rev 3:15-16

### Day #223 The New Covenant

Even though Israel was the chosen people of God the story does not end there. Everyone is a child of God whether Israelite or Pagan. God reveals this new covenant through the prophet Isaiah. God is making a new covenant with humanity, expanding "all flesh" to be part of his kingdom. A new heaven and a new earth God is making, Jesus will establish this kingdom and this kingdom will never end, and everyone is welcome. The priesthood is now opened up to everyone ‚Äì not just the tribe of levities.
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the Lord; so shall your descendants and your name remain. From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the Lord. Is 66: 22,23
This new kingdom will be a kingdom of abundance ‚Äì an abundance of Mercy, Love, and Peace. This kingdom will be a prosperous Kingdom, flowing like a river and wealth like an overflowing stream. God will comfort us with the new covenant ‚Äì just as a mother comforts her child.
For thus says the Lord: I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm, and dandled on her knees. 13 As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. Is 66:12,13
In this new covenant, we can find endless streams of God‚Äôs mercy flowing from Jesus‚Äôs side on the cross. We have access to the richest food, which is God Himself ‚Äì Jesus‚Äô Body and blood. The Holy Spirit has been poured out into our hearts, the living waters which never dry up.
Let us be thankful and rejoice that we are in the new covenant. Thank you, Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Isaiah 66:18-21
Jesus chose Paul to fulfill this prophecy.  Paul went far and wide to the gentile nations around Israel to preach the Gospel to them and brought many of them into the Church. According to this prophecy, those were the descendants of the scattered tribes.  Paul therefore chose to preach in the Synagogues where he could find the Jews as well as the gentiles who were the mixed descendants of the scattered tribes.

Paul later ordained many of them to serve as priests and deacons/Levites in the Church (Acts 20:28).

### Day #224 Jeremiah‚Äôs call is our call

Just reading Jeremiah‚Äôs call gives me goosebumps. Our dear ‚ÄúAbba‚Äù - Father God knew us before we were born, He formed us in our mother's womb and appointed us to be a prophet to the nations.
Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
5 ‚ÄúBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.‚Äù
6 Then I said, ‚ÄúAh, Lord God! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.‚Äù 7 But the Lord said to me,
‚ÄúDo not say, ‚ÄòI am only a boy‚Äô; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you. 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.‚Äù
9 Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me,
‚ÄúNow I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.‚Äù Jer 1:4-10
We are all called to evangelize, to let our light shine before all. There is no exception to this calling, every Christian is called to bear Christ ‚Äì that is why we are called Christians (Christian means Christ-bearer). We are supposed to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
It can seem frightening to Evangelize as we may not feel prepared to do so.
Jeremiah was but a boy and the Lord knew that Jeremiah would not feel ready to be a prophet, to speak God‚Äôs word. That is why in the call itself God told him not to fear or feel inferior to anyone. God reminds us as we read this, that we should not fear anything or anyone ‚Äì but rely on God fully. We should only speak what the Lord is guiding us to speak.
Just as the Lord touched the tongue of Jeremiah and anointed and appointed him to be a prophet to the nations. Jesus touches our tongues every time we receive Communion. At the end of Mass, we are commissioned by the priest (Jesus in the person of the priest) to go out and announce the Good news of the Lord. We can go out boldly knowing that God is with us, wherever we go and He will confirm the Good news we announce with signs and wonders. Let us not fear, but step out in faith, for the God who formed us in our mother‚Äôs womb is with us, till the end of times.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 224 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 1:4-10
The conversations between God and the prophets are recorded to prove that the prophets were called by God.

Jeremiah 1:5
\*Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.‚Äù\*

Before Jeremiah was even conceived in the womb, God had already started preparing Jeremiah for his involvement in God‚Äôs divine plan.

Before a child is even conceived in the womb, God already has a mission ready for the child.  Abortion and use of birth control techniques are all diabolic because they are Satan‚Äôs ways of making sure that God does not fulfill His divine plan for the world.  Therefore, being an obstacle in God‚Äôs divine plan is a mortal sin.  Through these ungodly acts we may have destroyed God‚Äôs chosen prophets, priests, scientists, rulers, etc. who would have made a positive difference to the world.  We also reduce considerably the number of souls going to Heaven, and we are therefore responsible for the misery and chaos in our homes and in the world which Satan happily gives us in return for obeying him.

It is for God to decide how many children a womb must bring forth.  It is not for us to decide.  As parents we must ensure that all our children receive spiritual nourishment so that all souls receive eternal life.

Jeremiah 1:6-8
In the Jewish community, a male child was a boy till his beard began to grow or until he was 21 years of age.  This means God called Jeremiah very early in his life.

There is no age limit for doing God‚Äôs work.  God can call us anytime of our life to be a part of His divine plan.  Abraham was called when he was 75, Moses was called when he was 80, Jeremiah was called when he was less than 21 years of age.
When God calls us for His divine mission we must be ready and willing.

### Day #225 Cracked cisterns instead of fountains of living water

Prophet Jeremiah speaks this message of the people's betrayal; the Israelites have forsaken the Lord.
The Lord is shocked, that his own people ‚Äì the ones he brought out of slavery into the promised land, have abandoned Him. The Israelites have committed two evils, they have forsaken the fountains of living waters and have created cracked cisterns that don‚Äôt even hold water.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord, 13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 2 Jer 12,13
We have in some way or the other forsaken God and got attached to things of this world instead. We have abandoned the love, joy, and peace that comes from a good relationship with the Lord to a self-seeking, self-centered view of things ‚Äì where we are more concerned about our status, health, looks, wealth, and comfort.
St Augustine in the first Chapter of ‚ÄúThe confessions‚Äù states that we will never rest until we rest in the Lord.
You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.
We have abandoned a 'life in the Spirit, the life where the Holy Spirit will become a spring of water gushing up to heaven. We are led by worldly thoughts and ideas. We are running after things that perish and rot. Instead of being led by the Spirit, we are being led by our desires and passions ‚Äì which are the cisterns that are cracked. We will never be satisfied no matter how much earthly success, wealth, beauty, lust, drunkenness, status, or comfort we may get.
Let us choose the Holy Spirit, the living waters, the life springs instead of worldly things.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 225 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezekiel 28:12-17
God told Ezekiel to speak to Satan who was behind the king‚Äôs evil deeds.

Unlike humans, angels have a superior intellect by which they can clearly see the consequences of their choices in advance and therefore there is no forgiveness for them when they disobey God.  Inspite of that, Lucifer chose to be the topmost in an inferior order rather than becoming one among others in a superior order.
In other words, Lucifer chose to be king in Hell as opposed to being a servant in Heaven

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt push others under our feet to obtain a higher position, whatever field we are in.
As followers of Christ, let us always look for opportunities to serve others.

Ezekiel 28:16
*What was Lucifer‚Äôs iniquity?*

Lucifer was chased out of God‚Äôs family (Heaven) because he was too busy with things that were taking him away from God, and eventually, in his pride, he started claiming equality with God (v. 2). Therefore he lost the anointing.  It is the same spirit which he puts in the minds of those who are hungry for power and success.

In the abundance of too many worldly activities, there is a possibility that we too may be filled with constant violence, anger and irritation. We may be having too many responsibilities, too many problems, too many things on our head, and then we sin.  We may also be too busy focusing on our success in life.

If we lead a busy life, with so many worldly activities which are not connected to spiritual activities, then there is a possibility that we too will lose the presence of God within us, and we will be chased out of God‚Äôs family (Heaven) if we have not repented and confessed our sins before our death.

Angels don‚Äôt have the option to repent for their sins and therefore Lucifer and his minions will remain permanently out of Heaven.  But we, humans, are so blessed that God, in His love for us, has given us, in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the option to repent and renew the Covenant, which we break with our sins.  Therefore, let us not ignore or reject God‚Äôs mercy; let us ensure to repent and confess our sins and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly so that we can remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times.

### DAY 225 By Sheila

JEREMIAH speaks of the intimacy of the Covenant Relationship between God and Israel denoting love, loyalty and a devotion like a young bride to the Lord. Israel was God's first fruit of the Nature.

According to the Old Testament, first fruit of the harvest belonged to God. The lsraelites had the full resources to God, the Living Water, yet took roads to broken cisterns or a black river. As Verse 37 "Your hands on your heads" Indicates, subject to foreign power.
EZEKIEL emphasized the gravity of sins of the King of Tyre. Verse 18 Fire represents God's Judgment.
PROVERBS speaks of the right way that leads to success and happiness and obedience to the Will of God. Sin is often able to hide its own character, an easy path that leads to an early death.

### Unfaithful Israel

[![Unfaithful Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day226.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8j4wGdi7jWE "Unfaithful Israel")

### Day #226 True freedom is found in a Christ-centered life.

This proverb is so relevant to our times where everyone just wants the freedom to do as they please. We are a generation that doesn‚Äôt like restraints, borders, or limitations. We fight for rights and demand that everyone is given an opportunity to do as they please with their bodies/lives. We don‚Äôt like moderate living or many rules but are rebellious and careless.
The wise are cautious and turn away from evil, but the fool throws off restraint and is careless. Prov 14:16
Freedom seems to be misunderstood in our generation, freedom does not mean that we get to be God, we get to do what we want. Freedom means we choose what is good, and hold onto what is good.
Christ has set us free, by His life, death, and resurrection. A heavy price was paid for our freedom.
Our Salvation is free, not cheap,
Christ paid for our sins. We are called to Freedom and not to misuse our freedom.
13 For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. 14 For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚ÄùRom 5:13,14
Our Freedom should lead us to a holy life, a Christ-Centered life, not a Live where we are free to do what we want. We will never be satisfied if we just do what we want, in fact, the one who throws away restraint is called a fool in the proverb. No one can ride a horse without a bit/bridle in its mouth or control a ship without a rudder and wheel. A life without restraint is like riding a wild horse.
Let us find true freedom in Christ, the freedom to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day #227 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskin of your hearts.

Sometimes our faith life can get limited to the outward following of rituals instead of heart-filled worship. We can be going through the motions in our spiritual life and not even know it. We may be praying but our heart is far from the Lord. The Jewish people have lost the true essence of the covenant they had with the Lord. They needed a wake-up call, a great awakening. The Lord is trying to get His people back, prophet after prophet is calling out to the people to repent. Prophet Jeremiah has been preaching repentance for years now, he cries out.
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of your hearts Jer 4:4
It is very important to be cut to the heart, each time we repent. Just following the customs or babbling prayers may make us just like the Pharisees and teachers of the Law who stood on street corners and prayed lengthy prayers and made a big show of the charity they did.
We are called to make humble prayers, prayers of a child to the Father. For God will hear those prayers that come from the heart.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
When we make a confession, we are usually listing out all the sins that we committed. Along with confessing those sins, we should also take resolve, to avoid them in the future. The Change has to be in the heart, truly sincere and genuine. A contrite heart the Lord will not despise.
The heart is where all sin originates and then becomes actions. Jesus reminds us that outward customs of washing of hands is not as important as having a clean heart.
Then he said, ‚ÄúAre you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? 18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles. 19 For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. 20 These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.‚Äù Mat 15:16-19
So let us examine our hearts and circumcise ourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of the heart(Speaking metaphorically like the Scripture.). Let us rend our hearts and not our garments.

Jeremiah 3:1-2
According to the law, an unfaithful wife, who provoked a divorce from her husband and married another man, was not allowed to return to her first husband (Deut. 24:1-4).

Similarly, unfaithful Israel, who provoked the Lord to anger by defiling their sacred land with idolatry, would not be allowed to be part of God's family.

It is the same condition in the new Covenant also.

Unfaithful Christians, who provoke the Lord to anger by defiling themselves with idolatry (that is, putting their faith and trust in humans and earthly things), will not be allowed to be part of God's family.

Jeremiah 3:3
*Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come;*

God would stop the rain because the people worshipped the false fertility gods to receive abundant crop when it was God who gave them a fertile soil.

Jeremiah 3:19-20
Jeremiah blends fatherly love and marital love as a tangible expression of the Covenant relation.

### Day #227 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskin of your hearts.

Sometimes our faith life can get limited to the outward following of rituals instead of heart-filled worship. We can be going through the motions in our spiritual life and not even know it. We may be praying but our heart is far from the Lord. The Jewish people have lost the true essence of the covenant they had with the Lord. They needed a wake-up call, a great awakening. The Lord is trying to get His people back, prophet after prophet is calling out to the people to repent. Prophet Jeremiah has been preaching repentance for years now, he cries out.
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,
remove the foreskin of your hearts Jer 4:4
It is very important to be cut to the heart, each time we repent. Just following the customs or babbling prayers may make us just like the Pharisees and teachers of the Law who stood on street corners and prayed lengthy prayers and made a big show of the charity they did.
We are called to make humble prayers, prayers of a child to the Father. For God will hear those prayers that come from the heart.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
When we make a confession, we are usually listing out all the sins that we committed. Along with confessing those sins, we should also take resolve, to avoid them in the future. The Change has to be in the heart, truly sincere and genuine. A contrite heart the Lord will not despise.
The heart is where all sin originates and then becomes actions. Jesus reminds us that outward customs of washing of hands is not as important as having a clean heart.

### Day #228 A Sentinel just cannot keep quiet when he sees the sword coming

This is such a beautiful read, a good reminder to speak up and warn this world. It is worth reading God‚Äôs word one more time. It‚Äôs explained in such clarity that we need not add much of an explanation.

The word of the LORD came to me: 2 O Mortal, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one of their number as their sentinel; 3 and if the sentinel sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people; 4 then if any who hear the sound of the trumpet do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes them away, their blood shall be upon their own heads. 5 They heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; their blood shall be upon themselves. But if they had taken warning, they would have saved their lives. 6 But if the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any of them, they are taken away in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at the sentinel‚Äôs hand.
7 So you, mortal, I have made a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 8 If I say to the wicked, ‚ÄúO wicked ones, you shall surely die,‚Äù and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at your hand. 9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from their ways, and they do not turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but you will have saved your life. Ezekiel 33:1-9
We can sometimes try to be politically correct or avoid confrontation. But we are the Sentinel who needs to blow the trumpet, if we don‚Äôt speak up the blood of the innocent will be on our hands. For Example: If we do not take a stand for abortion rights, we will be accountable for the innocent babies. If we fail to correct our children who want to cohabitate before marriage, we are liable for their sins. If we allow evil to enter this society without any pushback we will be held responsible for future generations.
We not only need to speak up but have to live a just life. We cannot be a hypocrite, speak against sin and commit it ourselves. If we live bad lives and call ourselves Christians, we are actually leading others to sin ‚Äì it‚Äôs the sin of scandal.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines scandal as ‚Äúan attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor‚Äôs tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death.‚Äù Our Lord militates against scandal, and even ties a curse to those who promote it: ‚ÄúWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea‚Äù (Matt 18:6).

Let us be a good Sentinel/Watchman and warn this generation of the evil we are committing. It does not matter if they listen or not, we just need to speak the truth in love.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Shepherds of Israel

[![Shepherds of Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day229.jpg)](https://youtu.be/aPLc49xQNBE "Shepherds of Israel")

### Day #229 The Lord will be our Shepherd

As we read through the OT we see that the Spiritual leaders were not really doing what they were called to. They are not taking good care of those entrusted to their care.
The word of the Lord came to me: 2 ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? 3 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. 4 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. 5 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. 6 My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. Eze 34:1-6
Sometimes parishes can face this problem when the pastor does not be a shepherd to the flock. This could be the case when a Parent does not care for the children. This could be the case when a teacher does not really take care of her class. Everyone is called to serve in some capacity or the other and when we fail to live up to our calling, we end up like the shepherds of Israel. Failing in our responsibility is actually okay as long as we want to do better and try to improve. As long as we are not like the shepherds of Israel who only took care of themselves, who ate and cloth themselves well and ignored the people under their care. Who did not bind up the wounds properly.
They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, ‚ÄúPeace, peace,‚Äù when there is no peace. Jer 6:14
Let us not tell people that all is good when things are not good, we should be genuine in our message and care for others. The shepherds of Israel would give false hope to the people telling them that everything is fine when it actually was not. They would say Peace when there was no peace.
Let the bad example of the shepherds of Israel lead us to become good shepherds. Good shepherds after the heart of Jesus ‚ÄúThe Good Shepherd‚Äù.
Jesus the Good shepherd fulfilled this promise that God made us through the prophet Ezekiel.
11 ‚Äú‚ÄòFor this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. 12 As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. 13 I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. 14 I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 15 I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord. 16 I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. Eze 33: 11-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 229 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 6:17
*I raised up sentinels for you, ‚ÄúGive heed to the sound of the trumpet!‚Äù*

Sentinels are watchmen who must remain awake and alert, without a break, while on duty.  They are put in charge of the four towers above the city gate to watch for any possible enemies and alert the king and his people of any possible danger.
A prophet functions in a similar manner.  His duty is to protect God's people from the spiritual enemy (Satan).

Ezekiel 34:11-12
*For thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.  As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep have been scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.*

There were many false shepherds in ancient Israel who led God‚Äôs people astray.  During the time of Jesus the false shepherds were king Herod (he was not from the Davidic family) and the High Priests Annas and Caiaphas (they were not from the Aaronic family).  Whichever families they came from, in their role as king and priests their duty was to lead the people to God but they became rich by abusing the people, they led ungodly lives themselves and led the people away from God.

God promised that He would rescue His lost sheep on the day of the crucifixion of Jesus, in the presence of Jews from all over the world, when there would be clouds and thick darkness due to an eclipse (Matthew 27:45).

As commanded by God, through Moses, all Jewish men had to celebrate Passover and Pentecost once a year ‚Äúonly in Jerusalem.‚Äù  This was planned by God so that every Jewish man would be present on Passover day when Jesus would die on the Cross to save them and the rest of the world.  They later gathered again in Jerusalem on Pentecost Sunday, 50 days after the Resurrection of Jesus, and 3,000 Jews, from all over the world, were baptized that day and thus they were rescued (Acts 2:7-11 & 37-41).

### A New Heart

[![A New Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day230.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fggc0kDh21M "A New Heart")

### Day #230 I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

The Love of the Lord is so great that even though the people of Israel left for idols and fake gods, God never forgot them. God promises to deliver Israel from exile and bring them back to their own land.
‚Äú‚ÄòFor I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 28 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. Eze 36:24-29
There is something more than being brought back to the own land. We all can relate to the warm feeling we get when we get back home. Home is a known safe place where we find comfort and rest. Just as the Israelites we can be living in exile ‚Äì spiritually.
Even though we live in a country that allows us to practice our religion, our hearts may be far from home. Our spiritual home is in God and we find rest, comfort, and peace only in His arms. We may have been living in an exile state of mind, when we sin we move away from God and our hearts become harder, if we continually sin our hearts become like stone. God wants to restore our stony hearts today, we are invited to go back to Him.
He will take away our hearts of stone and give us a heart of flesh, a heart that loves God and neighbor. We may be led by our own spirit or worldly spirits ‚Äì God will fill us with the Holy Spirit that will lead us to all truth. We will be washed by the blood of the lamb, made holy and pure. The new Spirit that we receive will help us to follow God‚Äôs ways, the Holy Spirit our helper will empower us to live holy lives.
Let us return to the Lord, trade our hearts of stone for a heart of flesh, and be filled by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Jeremiah 7:13-14
*And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.*

Even if we have been spending long hours in praise and worship and prayer, we can still be spiritually indifferent if our hearts are not with the Lord.

Jeremiah 7:16
*As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry or prayer on their behalf, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.*

Constantly interceding for the people was one of the important duties of a prophet.

Jeremiah 7:18
*Queen of Heaven.*

This was the goddess Ishtar who was believed by the people to be a goddess of fertility, love and war.

Jeremiah 7:22-23
*For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.  But this command I gave them, ‚ÄúObey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you.‚Äù*

Our sacrifices and offerings have no value when we live in disobedience to God.
Although this command was given to the Israelites during the time of Moses (Exodus 19:5), the same command is applicable to us too.

Ezekiel 36:23-24
*I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.  I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.*

In the old Covenant, Israel was supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world but, instead, they allowed the darkness of idolatry to seep into their own lifestyle.  Therefore, they were being prepared for exile.  But exile was not meant for God to get His back at the people. Exile was how God got His people back to Him.

In the new Covenant, Christians are supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world (Matthew 5:16).  So let us not make the same mistake by allowing the darkness of idolatry (wealth, power, comfort and pleasures of this world) to seep into our lifestyles.  Let us focus more on God, and not on accumulating wealth and possessions, or else we too may have to face a similar exile (physical or spiritual or maybe both).

Ezekiel 36:25-28
*I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.  A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.  Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

In the old Covenant, ritual washing with water was only a symbol of baptism. The water just cleaned their bodies externally.  It never cleansed anyone of their sins.
Ezekiel was prophesying about baptism in the new Covenant.  God promised to give us His divine Spirit through our baptism, which was inaugurated when the Holy Spirit anointed Jesus during His baptism.

In the new Covenant, baptism is not an upgraded ritual of the past.  Baptism gives us the Spirit of God, that is, divine life, thus making us members of God's family, but the actual grace of baptism comes to us from Jesus through the baptized humans who baptize us, as it does with all the other sacraments as well.

The Holy Spirit was released to the world only once, on Pentecost Sunday, and it is the same Spirit which is given to each one of us individually through the sacraments.

### BIAY Day 231 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 8:18-22
Gilead was known for its world famous herbal treatments.
God had been silent when the people were suffering and it didn't look like any help was going to come from Heaven.  The only option left was for the prophet to weep continuously for his people because although they were suffering due to the calamity he was more hurt because of their spiritual blindness (v. 19-20).  They ignored or took for granted all the blessings and miracles which God had done in their lives.
Jeremiah cried for his people just as Jesus cried for His people because His people refused to follow Him (Luke 19:41).

Ezekiel 37:1-6
The dry bones will be the in-gathering of the Jews without the Holy Spirit because of their unbelief.  The Holy Spirit will breathe divine life into them only when they will believe in Christ and accept to be baptized.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

### Day#231 By Michael Eltham

The Valley of dry bones ‚Äì hope in the Lord
The best way to read this is to place yourself in the field of dry bones. Let us try to prayerfully read this scripture ‚Äì try to imagine that you are present in the valley.
The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, ‚ÄúSon of man, can these bones live?‚Äù
I said, ‚ÄúSovereign Lord, you alone know.‚Äù
4 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to these bones and say to them, ‚ÄòDry bones, hear the word of the Lord! 5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
9 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.‚Äô‚Äù 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet‚Äîa vast army.Eze 37:1-10
This vision of Ezekiel would have been so hard to preach because Israel was in a state of despair, they had no hope. They were in exile in a place of no return. They would have found the prophecy to hard to believe.
We could sometimes be in a situation where there seems to be no hope, death is all around us and we feel that there is no redemption, there is no return. This could be the state of someone we love, a spouse/parent/child/friend ‚Äì we know for a fact that this person will never change or will never accept Christ ‚Äì before we rule it out, let us remember that our God can do anything. Let us not lose faith, but pray unceasingly for these dead situations.
The Lord that created this world from nothing, can bring life back to things that seem dead. It may take a process, but we need to walk with the Lord and follow His instructions ‚Äì like Ezekiel we may have to prophesy a few times until the bones become fully alive. The God who put breath in Adam is able to also put breath back in dead bones. He is able to bring the dead(Lazarus) to life again.
Then he said to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‚ÄòOur bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.‚Äô 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.‚Äô‚ÄùEze 36:11-14
The meaning of the prophecy is clear, God will bring back life to Israel and put His breath in them again, they will come back to the promised land and He will be their God and they shall be His people.
It is so with us as well, if you find yourself in a place of no hope, due to sin or sickness just return to the Lord who is able to restore you to life. He will put His breath in you and He will be your God and you shall be his child.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day#232 By Michael Eltham

Let us not boast in our wisdom, might or wealth but in the knowledge of Christ.
There are many wise, wealthy, and mighty people in this world. Many people are in a rat race to become wise, wealthy, and mighty and spend their entire lives perusing these things. Wisdom, wealth, and Might are good things and we should peruse them and be prosperous. There is nothing wrong is learning, accumulating wealth and building your strength. But we should not boast in them, we should only use them as created things and always treat them as dirt in comparison to our faith life.
23 Thus says the Lord: Do not let the wise boast in their wisdom, do not let the mighty boast in their might, do not let the wealthy boast in their wealth; 24 but let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.
Let us never boast in our accomplishments but rather boast in our relationship with the Lord. Let us remember that all good comes from the Lord and that we and our attributes are nothing but a gift from the Lord. All human wisdom is nothing but foolishness to God.
18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become ‚Äúfools‚Äù so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God‚Äôs sight. As it is written: ‚ÄúHe catches the wise in their craftiness‚Äù; 20 and again, ‚ÄúThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.‚Äù21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! 1 Cor 3:18-21
We should not boast in our wisdom as the wisdom of the world is foolishness in God's sight. We should boast in the knowledge of the Lord, for knowing God is the greatest thing that can ever happen to us, and having a relationship with God is the greatest achievement that one can have. St Paul was a learned Jew who was persecuting the Christians and finally converted, his letters are so filled with wisdom and he achieved many things in his life.
7 Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. 10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, 11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
We like St Paul should consider everything as rubbish in comparison to the value of knowing Christ. Our wisdom, might, and wealth are all utter rubbish compared to our dear Lord Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Day 233: Correct me, O Lord ‚Äî The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)

Fr. Mike reflects on Jeremiah‚Äôs sorrow for the people of Israel while reminding us that the one thing we ought to find glory in, is in understanding and knowing God. In our reading of Ezekiel, we hear about God's ongoing promise to restore Israel. Today‚Äôs readings are Jeremiah 9, Ezekiel 39, and Proverbs 15:1-4.

### Day #233 By Michael Eltham

Making God in our own image and likeness.

As we read through the Old Testament, we see that idolatry comes up a lot. We read the description of how a tree is cut down, and an artisan carves out idols according to his own imagination. How the metal workers put metal on it, and how the people deck it with gold and silver. The idol is installed in a field or in a temple and people worship it. Although the idol cannot talk or act, cannot move or do good or bad, people worship it as they want. They did whatever shameful acts that they wanted in front of the idols and called it a sacrifice to the god. Do not learn the way of the nations, or be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.

3 For the customs of the peoples are false: a tree from the forest is cut down, and worked with an ax by the hands of an artisan; 4 people deck it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move. 5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good. Jer 10:2-5

Now I‚Äôm sure none of us would do such a thing as worship an idol, then how do we apply this in our day and age?

We can be that crafty artisan who makes God according to his own imagination, we could take the real God Jesus Christ and put Him in a box. We can believe things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to sin God will forgive me anyways‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll God‚Äôs are equal and every religion is correct‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Jesus is present in the Eucharist ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a ritual‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to confess my sins to a priest‚Äù or ‚ÄúThere is no need for community pray ‚Äì I will just pray in my room‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to live with my partner before marriage if my intention is to marry‚Äù.

We can try to interpret scripture to suit our own needs ‚Äì for example ‚Äì ‚ÄúJesus changes gallons of water into wine, that means I should drink a lot‚Äù or ‚ÄúScripture says Keep holy the sabbath ‚Äì so I can freely sin on other days.‚Äù

I think that the new idolatry that we will encounter a lot is not worshiping an idol but making the true God Jesus Christ in our own image and likeness. We make an idol of the true God and think that our imagination is the truth. We are crafty in many ways to twist things and make them fit according to what we like.

Let us seek the Lord in all truth and let Him be Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
