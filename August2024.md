### Day #214 Can a woman forget her nursing child?

The love of a mother is the strongest human love that anyone can experience (although there can be exceptions). A mother‚Äôs love is so great that she is ready to sacrifice her own joy for the joy of the children. She will do anything it takes to see her children succeed. We can all relate to the warm love our mothers showed us, and the care and comfort we found in her bosom. Mother‚Äôs love is demonstrated in the lovely food they made, the clean house they kept, and the hard work they did in the house and at the office as well. Mothers don‚Äôt ever take sick days; they are constantly working to keep the family happy. The love of a mother for her newborn is admirable, she will keep up all night to ensure the baby is happy. Although the love of a mother is great, there can be times when she will not be the mother she is called to be. Mothers are human as well and can have many flaws. Even if a mother will forsake her infant, God will never abandon us or forsake us.
But Zion said, ‚ÄúThe Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.‚Äù Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. Is 49:14-16
The Lord called me before I was born, while I was in my mother‚Äôs womb he named me. Is 49:1
The Lord is our true parent, He had named us even when we were in our mother‚Äôs womb. The Lord has inscribed us on the palms of His hands. We are truly loved and admired by our God. Even if everyone on earth leaves us if we are abandoned by our parents, children, friends, spouse, family, and siblings the Lord will never leave us. We can always trust God to be there for us, even if human beings leave us.
The best place to be is in the arms of Abba father. We sometimes overthink or overanalyze our faith, we just need to be held by God sometimes. He is our father and we are His Children. We will not be forgotten.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 49:1-4
The *servant of the Lord* is Jesus as well as Israel, therefore what was true for Jesus and the old Israel is also true for the new Israel (the Christians).

The Lord plans our mission on earth long before we are born and sends us to the earth to carry out that mission while we also earn our living, just as it was with Jesus.
Let us therefore ask the Lord to help us know what our mission is and surrender ourselves to Him so that He can carry out that mission through us, as He wills.
Let us glorify the Lord by sharing the Word of God with the people around us, starting with our families, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.
Let us also glorify the Lord by loving and caring for everyone including our enemies.

Let us allow God to continue working through us even though we cannot see the fruit of our efforts in the midst of an evil world.

### Day #215 How beautiful are the feet of the messenger who announces peace

Good news is always something people look forward to, whether it is an appointment letter to your new job or acceptance to college, or to a sports team. We are eager to hear good news and always wait for the people who bring it to us. Of course, the biggest news to humanity is the promise of a redeemer, the announcement of salvation and the fact that God will reign over Zion is good news to the Israelites.
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns.‚Äù Is 51:7
However, the Israelites were expecting a King ‚Äì who would fight and destroy the nations that are keeping them captive. However God‚Äôs ways are not our ways, we will eventually be given Jesus who conquered with love. He did not come to destroy the people who were keeping Israelites' captives but to save them. He would come not to dominate and rule with force, but to submit himself even unto death, to show us 'the way of love' and 'the way of peace'.
Just as there were many who were astonished at him ‚Äîso marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals‚Äî 15 so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Is 51:14,15
He was the suffering servant, marred beyond recognition. Even though Jesus is God, He accepted torture at the hands of his creation. He loves us to the point where He took on our sins and our death. He suffered in our place so that we can be saved.
Your feet will be beautiful to this hurting world if you can carry this good news to them. The news that Jesus loves them dearly, even unto death.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Suffering Servant

[![The Suffering Servant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day216.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A86jWg7J1BI "The Suffering Servant")

### Day #216 By his bruises we are healed

When we get sick or hurt, we immediately turn to medicine and the doctors to cure us. The doctors can prescribe medicine, but healing is from the Lord. We are healed by Jesus, by his bruises we are healed. Medicine and faith go hand in hand ‚Äì doctors are a gift from God, our intelligence is from God, and advancement in science and technology is a blessing if we use it in accordance with God‚Äôs will. According to OT Jewish practice sin brought disease and poverty and prosperity and health were due to a holy life. This statement is true but not a hard and fast rule for every situation, for example, the holy saints suffered even though they did very little sin and a dodgy businessman becomes rich because of his corrupt ways. One thing is sure since God is just ‚ÄúSin brings punishment‚Äù however God does not want to punish us for life, he loves us and wants us to be whole. For a brief moment, He may forsake us, but with great compassion, he will comfort us.
For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. Is 53:7-8
Our Redeemer Jesus has carried our sins and diseases, he was stricken, wounded, and crushed for our transgressions. He that knew no sin, has taken on all the sins of every single person starting from Adam to the last person alive. We are healed because of Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross, by his bruises we are healed. Even though our sins should cause us sickness and punishment, Jesus took that suffering on himself. If we repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness, Jesus will not only forgive us our sins but also heal our bodies.
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain. When you make his life an offering for sin,
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Is 53:4-6, 10, 12
The promise that was given to Noah that the earth will never be destroyed again by a flood is extended to all humanity. In Jesus God promises that he will not be angry with us and the covenant of peace will not be removed. Even though the mountains may depart the hills be removed, God‚Äôs steadfast love will not depart from us. God looks at humanity through the lens of Jesus, we can always find God‚Äôs never-ending love and mercy in the cross of Jesus.
This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you. 10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us

### BIAY Day 216 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 53:3
\*He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\*

The Sanhedrin handed Jesus over to Pilate to be crucified so that He could be hung on a tree according to the punishment laid out for criminals (Deuteronomy 21:22-23), not realising that they were fulfilling the prophecy (Isaiah 53:4-5).
The people despised Jesus because it looked to them as if God was unhappy with Him and therefore He was being punished as He deserved, according to the blessings and curses under the Law (Deuteronomy 27:11-26 & 28:1-68).

Isaiah 53:5
\*By his stripes we are healed.\*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His hard life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus our souls are healed.

Isaiah 54:1-10
Our relationship with God is like the relationship of a bride and her groom.
Therefore, God sees sin as spiritual adultery because sin is not just the breaking of a law or commandment; it is the breaking of our relationship with God because when we sin we abandon Jesus and we hold the hand of Satan (our lover).

Exile is not a divorce. It is just a temporary separation between bride and her groom, who is her provider and protector, so that when the bride starts suffering due to separation she will realize her errors, repent and return to her groom.

God doesn't abandon us when we sin; it is we who abandon Him, and we can re-unite with Him only after we examine our conscience, repent, and confess our sins.
But it seems like it will be a long time before the people will realize their errors and repent because Isaiah assures them that, although the enemy has occupied their territory, their land will not be lost.  It will be recovered by their descendants.  They will be gathered together in the new Covenant when God will come down on earth to stay with His people (Matthew 28:20).

Sometimes our sufferings look like they are never going to end till we die and that may be true because in all that time God is waiting for us to repent and it is we who are delaying.

Ezekiel 14:13-14
\*When a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it human beings and animals, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they would save neither sons nor daughters; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord God.\*

This warning is not meant to cause us despair. It is meant to be an encouragement for us to pray and evangelize so that our culture does not reach the depths that is followed by judgment, as it happened with Sodom and Gomorrah.
Let us therefore get busy and spread the Word of God to everyone around us so that we can transform our ungodly culture into a godly one.

### The Everlasting Covenant

[![The Everlasting Covenant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day217.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6xWpWX7jF4c "The Everlasting Covenant")

### Day #217 For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples

God‚Äôs mercy is never ending and his steadfast love will not depart from us. However, in order to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness and mercy we need to seek Him, draw near to him and forsake our evil ways. We need to seek the Lord while he may be found, seek him while we are alive, and have an opportunity to repent ‚Äì once dead we cannot repent.
Draw near to God, while he is near, whenever you have an opportunity to pray ‚Äì use it and don‚Äôt lose it. If we return to the Lord he will have mercy on us and he will abundantly pardon us for any sin that we have committed. We may feel like running or hiding when we sin, but we should pray and return to God. For his ways are not our ways and his thoughts higher than our thoughts, just return to him while he may be found.
Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; 7 let the wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. Is 55
God‚Äôs thoughts are higher than our thoughts, we may condemn and put down people but God treats everyone equally. The people in Isaiah‚Äôs time would probably put down the Eunuch and the Foreigner. We should never put down people because of their sexual orientation or ethnicity. The church can determine who is in the state to receive communion(those who are in the state of grace) but as far as worshiping at Mass ‚Äì all are welcome, whether straight or otherwise, whether rich or poor, no matter what nationality one belongs to, the Catholic Church should welcome everyone, and so should every parish. The House of the Lord will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples. The church is a place not for ‚Äúsaints only‚Äù but a refuge for sinners too.
Do not let the foreigner joined to the Lord say, ‚ÄúThe Lord will surely separate me from his people‚Äù; and do not let the eunuch say, ‚ÄúI am just a dry tree.‚Äù 4 For thus says the Lord: To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, 5 I will give, in my house and within my walls, a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. Is 55
Let us remember to love the Word of God, for God‚Äôs word will never return empty, it always accomplishes its purpose. Just like the rain that comes down from heaven waters the earth and brings forth sprouts, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater. God‚Äôs word is alive and active, melting our hearts as we read it.
10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

‚ÄúThe Bible is the only book where the author is present whenever anyone reads it. ‚Äú

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 217 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 55:1-3
Earthly food makes us hungry again but the food which God was promising His people was supernatural food, the Bread of the Presence which was one of the key signs of the Covenant (Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:8).

In the new Covenant it is the Body of Christ / the consecrated bread, which is not for sale.

God was inviting His people to the Messianic banquet of the new Covenant where He would feed them with the Bread of life (the Body of Christ) which He gave to us in the Upper Room.

Isaiah 55:10‚Äì11
*For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.*

The rain that comes down is not unfruitful and it doesn't return back to where it came from. It waters the earth to give seed to the sower so that he can grow the crop and give bread to the eater to nourish his body.

Similarly, God's Word must bear fruit.  God does not withdraw His commands.
We cannot just read the Bible, meditate on the verses and close the book.  We must put God's Word into action.  God's Word says that we must love one another, and be kind and generous to others.  We must therefore go one step further and share God's love with others by loving them ourselves, being kind and generous with others without expecting any benefits, and living faithful Christian lives so that others will be drawn to Christ by the splendour of our lives.

When God speaks, His Word does something; it brings rain, it created the world in the beginning, it gave Abraham‚Äôs barren wife a son, etc. because God's Word has power and it must bear fruit.

Likewise, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" His words transformed the bread and wine into His mystical Body and Blood (Matthew 26:26-28).

When we are in union with the Lord, our words also have power because we are created in the likeness of God.
With our words we can bless others or with our words we can destroy others because death and life are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21).

Isaiah 56:3-7
In the old Covenant, foreigners and eunuchs were not allowed to enter the sacred areas of the Temple. Only Levites and the Aaronic priests could enter.
In the new Covenant, the priestly duties will be carried out by foreigners (non-Jews) who will be eunuchs (celebant).

This prophecy has been fulfilled in the Church where almost all priests are of non-Jewish blood and majority of them remain celebant by choice for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 19:12).

As Isaiah foretold, during worship we come to the Lord‚Äôs holy mountain, the heavenly Jerusalem, to offer the prescribed sacrifice, acceptable to God, at His Altar (Hebrews 12:22‚Äì24, 28).

[![Each Will Be Judged](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day218.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jp4cFECtMjw "Each Will Be Judged")

### Day #218 True fasting

Sometimes when we fast we may have the wrong intentions like ‚Äúlosing weight for lent‚Äù or ‚Äújust to tell everyone we are fasting‚Äù. We may sometimes fast for an intention and are laser-focused on the intention ‚Äì although this is not entirely wrong, the most important thing about fasting is to change our souls. If fasting causes you to get nasty and act badly towards others, then the fasting is not serving its purpose. We can be overly focused on the bodily aspects of fasting instead of the spiritual.
‚ÄúWhy do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?‚Äù Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers. 4 Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high. 5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord? Is 58:3-5
True fasting should make us better people, we should do good things when we fast. Not just be hungry and angry. We should do charity and good works when we fast. That is why the Church recommends prayer, fasting, and almsgiving as a combined formula for lent. When we fast from food we should also fast from evil ‚Äì no pointing fingers or speaking evil. We should feed the hungry and satisfy the needs of the poor.
If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, 10 if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday. 11 The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail. 12 Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in. Is 58
When we do the right fasting with prayer and almsgiving, God will bless our fast and we will be satisfied, our needs will be met, we will grow strong, and we will be built up. We will be like a watered garden whose water never fails. Our light shall break forth like the dawn.
Let us fast, pray and love - with a genuine heart. Rend our hearts and not our garments. Jesus reminded us to look good when we fast and not let anyone know, but God who sees our hearts will bless us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 218 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 58:1-10
The people fasted from food and water, covered themselves with ashes and sackcloth, and followed all the rituals required for fasting but they didn‚Äôt change their hearts/conscience.  They continued oppressing their poor workers, quarrelling with each other and doing many things which were not pleasing to the Lord.
The people gave only lip service to God while their hearts were far from God.

We cannot fulfil our obligations only by following religious rituals.
God is deeply moved when the poor and needy ones cry out to Him for help and God is deeply hurt when we don't give true love to all the people in our lives.
God desires to share His love with all humanity and to help the less fortunate ones, but He needs the bodies of His baptized children to do all that.  And before we begin helping others, God wants us to change our hearts so that we do everything with love and not as an obligation.

The old Covenant people were clearly told once, and reminded several times, that God desires mercy towards the less fortunate ones (Deut. 15:11; Hosea 6:6) and Jesus also emphasized on the importance of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).

God doesn‚Äôt want our worship to be just an item ticked off on our checklist.  Therefore, fasting, praying, reading the Bible, attending daily/weekly Masses, etc. are of no use if we don‚Äôt have true love in our hearts for all the people in our lives and compassion for the poor and needy ones.

Ezekiel 18:4 & 20
God was speaking of spiritual death (Hell) (Ezekiel 18:4) because all humans are anyway subject to physical death.

No one is culpable for another person‚Äôs sins but when we commit mortal sins and we are comfortable living with them then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil‚Äôs aim is to destroy families because our earthly families were designed by God to be a symbol of the heavenly family.  Therefore, if we have committed a mortal sin then we must confess our sin immediately, without delay, and ensure that we live in obedience to God and keep our souls purified at all times.

If we are leading holy lives and suffering because of the sins of others, it is because we are members of the human family and our sins affect one another in various ways.  And God allows this to happen to us so that His grace can flow through us when we pray for our offenders while we are also spiritually healed.

Ezekiel 18:21-28
For a Christian, God's condition for judgement may seem fair, and so it is, but for the ancient Israelites it was an unfair judgment.

The ancient Israelites believed that they would receive eternal life if they lived righteous lives for a longer time, even if they  ended up dying in sin, and not according the state of their souls when they died. So, according to them, receiving or losing eternal life depended upon which kind of life they lived on earth for a longer time, that is, righteous or unrighteous.
Therefore, the people were complaining because they found God‚Äôs judgement to be unfair.

Let us check if we also believe what those ancient Israelites believed or whether we accept God's judgement as fair and just.

### Separation from God

[![Separation from God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day219.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8q5usBJOvC8 "Separation from God")

### Day #219 Growing little by little makes one stronger

Many people dream to win the lottery, especially those who have a lot of debts. We see poor people spending their money on lottery tickets. Most people will never win big prizes and those who actually win the jackpot will not know how to handle the big money.
Research shows that Lottery winners are more likely to declare bankruptcy within three to five years than the average American. What‚Äôs more, studies have shown that winning the lottery does not necessarily make you happier or healthier.
This proverb sheds wisdom on this aspect of our lives.
Wealth hastily gotten will dwindle, but those who gather little by little will increase it. Prov 13:11
Winning a lot of money won't make us rich, money will usually will dwindle pretty soon. For people are not prepared for it and they don‚Äôt know what to do with the money. Of course, there could be expectations that people have managed their finances well after winning a lottery.
On the other hand, one who slowly accumulates their wealth will know the value of money and will spend it wisely. That is why rich parents are advised to give little money to their kids else they will be spoiled.
The struggle that we face to climb the ladder of progress is good for us, it will teach us to be humble and wise in our spending. A lot of money will never make anyone happy, they may be happy for a little bit but will soon get bored. True happiness is in the process of struggling and growing.
It‚Äôs the same with our faith life, we cannot suddenly expect to grow and be given all the gifts. We will not know how to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit, that is why we need to slowly discover them. We need to struggle and journey so that we know the value of our spiritual gifts and our faith life. We need to walk daily with the Lord, we need to learn how to deny ourselves and slowly grow. If we fall we should get up and try again, never get disappointed but ‚Äúkeep On keeping ON‚Äù. May we receive the strength to follow the Lord closely, every day.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 219 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 59:1-2
*The Lord‚Äôs hand is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.  Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.*

When we confess our sins to the priest and our sins are forgiven, the barrier between God and us is removed and we are reconciled with God.

Therefore, if our prayers have not been answered for a long time, we need to examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to God, or not.  If not, then we need to repent and correct our errors.

At the start of Jesus' public ministry, he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; 2 to proclaim the year of the Lord‚Äôs favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; 3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion‚Äî to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. Is 61:1-3
Jesus read from Isaiah, and when he finished reading it.
‚ÄúAnd he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù Luke 4: 20,21
We have such a blessing in Jesus, God with us ‚Äì Emmanuel. Jesus came to bring good news to us the oppressed, He came to bind up the brokenhearted ‚Äì God is close to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34). Jesus came to set up free from sin and death, we were captives to sin we were prisoners to death ‚Äì there is no salvation for us without Jesus as we are sinful people. Jesus came to proclaim the year of favor ‚Äì instead of God‚Äôs vengeance Jesus brought us comfort. God does not deal with us according to our sins, He gives us a garland instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.
We are called to be a people of Praise and celebration. We should be rejoicing because of what Jesus has done for us. By His death and resurrection Jesus cloths us with righteousness and with garments of salvation.
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. Is 61:10
Jesus clothes us in garments of holiness, by the blood of His sacrifice. We are called to the wedding banquet of the Eucharist where the Bridegroom - Jesus rejoices over His bride the Church.
For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. Is 62:5
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 220 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 62:1-5
The bride will have a name change after marriage.
Most communities follow this tradition after marriage. But this is only a reflection of our spiritual marriage to Jesus during Mass in the new Covenant.
After her marriage with God, the new name of Jerusalem (the bride/the Church) will be "married/Mrs." ("Beulah" in Hebrew).  She will no longer be called abandoned / forsaken ("Azubah" in Hebrew) or barren / desolate ("Shemamah" in Hebrew) because after her marriage with God (the Son) during Mass she will have a spouse (Jesus) and she will go forth and evangelize to increase and multiply and fill the Church with souls.

Therefore, whenever we go to Church to attend Mass/the marriage feast of the Lamb, we must always dress modestly, as is also required of a bride, because we, the brides of Christ, are going to Church to marry the Holy King.
