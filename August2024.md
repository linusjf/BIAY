### The Hidden Glory of God

### Day #214 Can a woman forget her nursing child?

The love of a mother is the strongest human love that anyone can experience (although there can be exceptions). A mother‚Äôs love is so great that she is ready to sacrifice her own joy for the joy of the children. She will do anything it takes to see her children succeed. We can all relate to the warm love our mothers showed us, and the care and comfort we found in her bosom. Mother‚Äôs love is demonstrated in the lovely food they made, the clean house they kept, and the hard work they did in the house and at the office as well. Mothers don‚Äôt ever take sick days; they are constantly working to keep the family happy. The love of a mother for her newborn is admirable, she will keep up all night to ensure the baby is happy. Although the love of a mother is great, there can be times when she will not be the mother she is called to be. Mothers are human as well and can have many flaws. Even if a mother will forsake her infant, God will never abandon us or forsake us.
But Zion said, ‚ÄúThe Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.‚Äù Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. Is 49:14-16
The Lord called me before I was born, while I was in my mother‚Äôs womb he named me. Is 49:1
The Lord is our true parent, He had named us even when we were in our mother‚Äôs womb. The Lord has inscribed us on the palms of His hands. We are truly loved and admired by our God. Even if everyone on earth leaves us if we are abandoned by our parents, children, friends, spouse, family, and siblings the Lord will never leave us. We can always trust God to be there for us, even if human beings leave us.
The best place to be is in the arms of Abba father. We sometimes overthink or overanalyze our faith, we just need to be held by God sometimes. He is our father and we are His Children. We will not be forgotten.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 49:1-4
The *servant of the Lord* is Jesus as well as Israel, therefore what was true for Jesus and the old Israel is also true for the new Israel (the Christians).

The Lord plans our mission on earth long before we are born and sends us to the earth to carry out that mission while we also earn our living, just as it was with Jesus.
Let us therefore ask the Lord to help us know what our mission is and surrender ourselves to Him so that He can carry out that mission through us, as He wills.
Let us glorify the Lord by sharing the Word of God with the people around us, starting with our families, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.
Let us also glorify the Lord by loving and caring for everyone including our enemies.

Let us allow God to continue working through us even though we cannot see the fruit of our efforts in the midst of an evil world.

### Day #215 How beautiful are the feet of the messenger who announces peace

Good news is always something people look forward to, whether it is an appointment letter to your new job or acceptance to college, or to a sports team. We are eager to hear good news and always wait for the people who bring it to us. Of course, the biggest news to humanity is the promise of a redeemer, the announcement of salvation and the fact that God will reign over Zion is good news to the Israelites.
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns.‚Äù Is 51:7
However, the Israelites were expecting a King ‚Äì who would fight and destroy the nations that are keeping them captive. However God‚Äôs ways are not our ways, we will eventually be given Jesus who conquered with love. He did not come to destroy the people who were keeping Israelites' captives but to save them. He would come not to dominate and rule with force, but to submit himself even unto death, to show us 'the way of love' and 'the way of peace'.
Just as there were many who were astonished at him ‚Äîso marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals‚Äî 15 so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Is 51:14,15
He was the suffering servant, marred beyond recognition. Even though Jesus is God, He accepted torture at the hands of his creation. He loves us to the point where He took on our sins and our death. He suffered in our place so that we can be saved.
Your feet will be beautiful to this hurting world if you can carry this good news to them. The news that Jesus loves them dearly, even unto death.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Suffering Servant

### Day #216 By his bruises we are healed

When we get sick or hurt, we immediately turn to medicine and the doctors to cure us. The doctors can prescribe medicine, but healing is from the Lord. We are healed by Jesus, by his bruises we are healed. Medicine and faith go hand in hand ‚Äì doctors are a gift from God, our intelligence is from God, and advancement in science and technology is a blessing if we use it in accordance with God‚Äôs will. According to OT Jewish practice sin brought disease and poverty and prosperity and health were due to a holy life. This statement is true but not a hard and fast rule for every situation, for example, the holy saints suffered even though they did very little sin and a dodgy businessman becomes rich because of his corrupt ways. One thing is sure since God is just ‚ÄúSin brings punishment‚Äù however God does not want to punish us for life, he loves us and wants us to be whole. For a brief moment, He may forsake us, but with great compassion, he will comfort us.
For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. Is 53:7-8
Our Redeemer Jesus has carried our sins and diseases, he was stricken, wounded, and crushed for our transgressions. He that knew no sin, has taken on all the sins of every single person starting from Adam to the last person alive. We are healed because of Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross, by his bruises we are healed. Even though our sins should cause us sickness and punishment, Jesus took that suffering on himself. If we repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness, Jesus will not only forgive us our sins but also heal our bodies.
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain. When you make his life an offering for sin,
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Is 53:4-6, 10, 12
The promise that was given to Noah that the earth will never be destroyed again by a flood is extended to all humanity. In Jesus God promises that he will not be angry with us and the covenant of peace will not be removed. Even though the mountains may depart the hills be removed, God‚Äôs steadfast love will not depart from us. God looks at humanity through the lens of Jesus, we can always find God‚Äôs never-ending love and mercy in the cross of Jesus.
This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you. 10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us

### BIAY Day 216 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 53:3
\*He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\*

The Sanhedrin handed Jesus over to Pilate to be crucified so that He could be hung on a tree according to the punishment laid out for criminals (Deuteronomy 21:22-23), not realising that they were fulfilling the prophecy (Isaiah 53:4-5).
The people despised Jesus because it looked to them as if God was unhappy with Him and therefore He was being punished as He deserved, according to the blessings and curses under the Law (Deuteronomy 27:11-26 & 28:1-68).

Isaiah 53:5
\*By his stripes we are healed.\*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His hard life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus our souls are healed.

Isaiah 54:1-10
Our relationship with God is like the relationship of a bride and her groom.
Therefore, God sees sin as spiritual adultery because sin is not just the breaking of a law or commandment; it is the breaking of our relationship with God because when we sin we abandon Jesus and we hold the hand of Satan (our lover).

Exile is not a divorce. It is just a temporary separation between bride and her groom, who is her provider and protector, so that when the bride starts suffering due to separation she will realize her errors, repent and return to her groom.

God doesn't abandon us when we sin; it is we who abandon Him, and we can re-unite with Him only after we examine our conscience, repent, and confess our sins.
But it seems like it will be a long time before the people will realize their errors and repent because Isaiah assures them that, although the enemy has occupied their territory, their land will not be lost.  It will be recovered by their descendants.  They will be gathered together in the new Covenant when God will come down on earth to stay with His people (Matthew 28:20).

Sometimes our sufferings look like they are never going to end till we die and that may be true because in all that time God is waiting for us to repent and it is we who are delaying.

Ezekiel 14:13-14
\*When a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it human beings and animals, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they would save neither sons nor daughters; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord God.\*

This warning is not meant to cause us despair. It is meant to be an encouragement for us to pray and evangelize so that our culture does not reach the depths that is followed by judgment, as it happened with Sodom and Gomorrah.
Let us therefore get busy and spread the Word of God to everyone around us so that we can transform our ungodly culture into a godly one.
