### Day 19 Jealousy, Envy, and Resentment are the perfect ingredients for a "Mess". - Michael Eltham ###

Jacobs's sons were envious of their youngest brother "Joseph" because their father loved Joseph more than them. Joseph was the son of Rachel (the wife whom Jacob loved). The brothers did not stop at envy - they wanted to kill him but sold him instead and lied to their father.

We tend to think that - we would have never done it. We need to remember that we are all human and not superior to them. We should just be grateful that God has kept us from sin. We need to be thankful for our parents, siblings, spouse, children, teachers... We are responsible for not only listening to our conscience but also for "forming" it.

We have to learn life lessons from these stories in the Bible, read His Word, and transform our lives. We need to keep Jealousy in check least it becomes 'Envy' and 'Resentment' and 'deadly'.

Let us pray the prayer from the Psalms.

" Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. "  Psalm 19:13

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
