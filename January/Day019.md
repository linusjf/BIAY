### Day 19 Jealousy, Envy, and Resentment are the perfect ingredients for a "Mess". - Michael Eltham ###

Jacobs's sons were envious of their youngest brother "Joseph" because their father loved Joseph more than them. Joseph was the son of Rachel (the wife whom Jacob loved). The brothers did not stop at envy - they wanted to kill him but sold him instead and lied to their father.

We tend to think that - we would have never done it. We need to remember that we are all human and not superior to them. We should just be grateful that God has kept us from sin. We need to be thankful for our parents, siblings, spouse, children, teachers... We are responsible for not only listening to our conscience but also for "forming" it.

We have to learn life lessons from these stories in the Bible, read His Word, and transform our lives. We need to keep Jealousy in check least it becomes 'Envy' and 'Resentment' and 'deadly'.

Let us pray the prayer from the Psalms.

" Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. "  Psalm 19:13

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 19 Simitra ###

Genesis 37:11,  "So his brothers were jealous of him". Every action that we take is first perceived in the mind. That's why Romans 12:2 tells us to "be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect".

James 3:16,"For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind". The jealousy of Joseph's brothers allowed them to go to the extent of selling their own brother as a slave.

Let us ask for God's grace to be vigilant knowing what an evil jealousy is.

### Day-19 Anonymous ###

Joseph - beloved of Israel.  His brother's are jealous. Because of this distortion,  because of this jealousy, someone else has something that we believe is ours, should be ours.  In this case, it is the father's love.  They are not wrong.  They are wrong in choosing resentment.
Life is a gift.  We can't say it is owed to us. It is merely something that I can receive as a gratitude.

### Day 19 - Jealousy ###

Everytime a situation arises where all my human weaknesses such as anger, jealousy, vengeance or greed are hightened, the lines of a song *"make me a channel of your peace"* remind me to be humble and calm me down

" Oh master grant that i may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood, as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul"

These lines hold such deep meaning, and is very much in line with today's reading from Genesis as well. The brother's, by putting themselves before the other have led themselves to committng a crime. Had they for a moment, paused and put Joseph Or Israel before them, such a situation would not have come by.

Selfishness of feeding ones ego and desire lead to evil acts unfavorable to God.

So.. Each time we want out hearts or our desires to be fulfilled. Each time we feel we need more we don't have enough or are not given enough, we need to remind ourselves of these lines.

"For it is in giving that we receive"
