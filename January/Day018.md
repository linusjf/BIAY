### Day 18 Fr. Andrew ###

Mk 3:7-12

In the gospel, we see people giving Jesus an enthusiastic reception after hearing about the things He was doing. People converged on Him like a pilgrimage in faith. The hurdles on their way were no longer barriers but stepping stones to have a divine experience. 

Are you ready to walk an extra mile to meet or encounter Jesus? 

Wake up from your spiritual slumber! Give up the unnecessary luggage. Look up to Jesus. And with every step, build up your relationship with Him and with others 

"The problem is not in being sinners, the problem is when we don't let ourselves be transformed in love by the encounter with Christ‚Äù. Pope Francis

### Day 18 Simitra ###

God is faithful to his promises. It is impossible that God should prove false. The Bible is full of God's promises and all of them are a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù in Christ Jesus. 

Proverbs 3:26 says ‚Äúfor the Lord is your confidence‚Äù and the measure of our confidence in His promises is to the extent that we grow in the understanding of His love for us.

### Day 18 Anonymous ### 

How often God accomplishes His will, inspite of our brokenness. 

He is faithful & He is steadfast. 

All Glory to Jesus

### Day 18 "God is Faithful, even though we are not faithful." - Michael Eltham ###

As we read through the readings today. Names, names, and more names. It gets to that point where we can't even focus on the reading with all those names. However, we need just step back and look at how God works His will out. Abraham the man who had no kids till 99 is now becoming the father of the nations. His children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are being fruitful and multiplying. God gives Jacob a new name "Isreal" and 12 sons who become the 12 tribes of Isreal. The blessing of the Lord is on the family for generations, they prosper and their flock and lands are blessed.

‚ÄúNo one or nothing can change what God intends for us. He is a faithful God, what His hand does no one can stop. Let us feel confident today that God is in control of every situation, we are in His Hands.‚Äù - Michael Eltham 

Even though things seem not going right today (like Job), let us not lose hope for we have a Faithful God.

"Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." Is 49:15

‚ÄúForever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens. Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.‚Äù Psalm 119:89-90

"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." Prov 3:5

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè
