### Day 27: ‚ÄúJesus the new Moses‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We see how the new Egyptian king is afraid of the descendant of Joseph. Because the Lord is with Joseph‚Äôs generation, they were fruitful, prosperous, and multiplying. This freaked out the king.

Out of fear the new king does cowardly things like trying to kill the newborn sons, throwing them into the Nile. Imagine a royal king afraid of babies. Even the little babies of God‚Äôs people are powerful, we need to remember that the world is afraid of those who love God.

Jesus is the new Moses ‚Äì their story has many similarities. The ruler/king is afraid of them. There is a decree to kill the firstborn during both Moses' and Jesus' time. Moses was forced to be sent off in a basket from his own people the Israelites and went to the Egyptians. Joseph and Mary had to flee with baby Jesus from Israel to Egypt. Moses could not stand the unjust burdens put on the people of Israel; Jesus could not stand the insane number of spiritual burdens that the elders of Israel put on the people.

‚ÄúThe well‚Äù ‚Äì We must pay close attention when we read about a "well" in the Bible, as it‚Äôs usually associated with a wedding or wedding proposal. We read how Moses met his bride today at the well today. Also, remember how Abraham sent his servant to look for a wife for his son Isaac and the servant found Rebekah at the well.

Even Jesus found His bride at the well, the Samaritan women. Don‚Äôt be scandalized ‚Äì she just represents humanity. Jesus is our spiritual bridegroom and we, His bride.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
