### Day15: ‚ÄúWhat goes around comes around.‚Äù - Michael Eltham ###

We see how Jacob the younger brother tricked Esau to get the birthright and the blessing - a few chapters back. Now Jacob gets tricked by Laban his father-in-law, who promises Rachel the younger daughter if Jocob works for  7 years, he tricks him into marrying Leah. Jacob has to work another 7 years to marry the one he loves Rachel.

As we hear all that went down between the two wives Leah and Rachel trying to win the love of Jacob, we can draw a few conclusions - that 

1. it‚Äôs such a mess 

2. God is always on the side of those who are hated/deprived. 

Leah was tolerated/hated by her husband and the Lord blessed her by opening her womb and Rachel remained barren. However, the Lord did bless Rachel later on and opened her womb(probably after she turned to the Lord). 

Leah tried very hard to gain her husband's love - naming 3 children (in lines with my husband will Love Me) Many times spouses feel unloved, we need to pray and invite the Lord into the marriage and carry our cross until the Lord blesses our spouse. Let us rest assured that God will make something beautiful out of our mess, just as the twelve tribes of Israel were born amidst all the strife between Jacob and his two wives(the sisters).

We need to also invite the Lord in all our relationships, on our own we will make a mess of our marriage, as humans we are flawed. The Key is to invite the Lord into the relationships. 3 to a good marriage. The two spouses centered on the Lord. God will make something beautiful out of the mess we have created. 



May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
