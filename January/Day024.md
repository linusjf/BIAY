### Day 24: “Unity in the family” - Michael Eltham ###
Today’s readings make for such a beautiful scene. Joseph is united to his family, meets his beloved father (remember Joseph was the fav child), his younger brother who he never met before. He is reconciled with all his brothers who sold him. It’s the best feeling ever. No wonder he could not hold back tears, he cried like newborn baby. They all wept and hugged and felt complete as one family again. After all the betrayal, separation, anger, jealousy, loss, sadness… Finally, it’s time to be happy. Oh! what JOY!!! 

Ps 133:1  “Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!”

We choose our friends, but our family is given to us. Some people in the family are harder to love than others. But we should nevertheless pray and seek to live in harmony with everyone. It’s not easy, with our strength it’s impossible but with God “all things are possible”. Let us pray for our family, especially those who are difficult to live with.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Joseph! There's so much to love about him!

Did no wrong... was hated anyway.

Gave credit to God for the skill/blessing of being able to understand and explain dreams.

Recognised God's hand & God's providence in his life that led him to where he ended up... in the position of a saviour to those who hurt him.

Forgave those who caused him harm... demonstrated a generous love.

But my favourite thing about him—he cried.
I'm so glad that this is even in the Bible!

Men can cry.
Men should cry.
Crying is not a sign of weakness.
Crying has nothing to do with gender.
These are human emotions.
Men are human.
They should feel free to express themselves, and to cry...
in pain,
in fear,
in sorrow,
but even in joy!

May we allow, and even encourage, the boys and men in our lives to be true to themselves, and cry whenever they feel like it.

🥲
