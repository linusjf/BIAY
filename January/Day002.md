[![The Fall of Adam and Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/CIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WBg_xK44V0E "The Fall of Adam and Eve")

### Day2: *Distrust and Disobedience* - Michael Eltham ###

Man was made for communion with God, they spoke to God and heard God speak. It was a beautiful harmonious life, and everything was going great for Adam and Eve. As we read in the first chapter of the Catechism of the Catholic Church ‚Äì God created man to share in the blessed life of the Trinity. Adam and Eve were enjoying this beautiful life ‚Äì in direct communion with God.

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.CCC prologue 1

Now God has planted a garden in Eden and grew various plants with fruit that were pleasing to the eye and to eat. Adam was allowed to eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, ‚ÄúYou may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.‚Äù Gen 2:15-17

Satan is very crafty as we see in Genesis ‚Äì he sows seeds of doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. Satan tries to manipulate the truth and question it and eventually causes us to doubt the truth.

But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not die; 5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

Satan is proposing that God is a liar and that God does not want our good. According to satan, God didn‚Äôt want them to eat the fruit lest they become like God. This would have caused doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. The serpent described in Genesis is no rat snake, it's more like a Dragon like creature ‚Äì so there is also this element of fear that would have its role to play. Apart from doubt and fear satan eve was also fighting temptations.

So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise Gen 3:6

The fruit was also good to look at, good for the stomach and it made one like God.

She could not resist it anymore, the combined effect of doubt, fear, and temptation. She gave in and gave it to Adam as well, I would have expected Adam to at least resist ‚Äì but it‚Äôs described as though he just eats it. (Like a good husband ;) ‚Äì just joking ). Adam should have stood his ground and resisted the devil. 

The main thing that caused their fall was their distrust in God. God gave them everything ‚Äì every tree, every creature and even let them share in His divine life. But they just could not trust God enough. This distrust caused their disobedience. This caused sin to enter mankind. 

We can sit and marvel at how stupid our first parents were, but pointing one finger at someone points 4 fingers back at us. Genesis is not a storybook to read and fall asleep over, it‚Äôs the story of our lives. We are faced with the same temptations that Adam and Eve faced, we have doubts, fear, and temptation in our lives.

God has given us the truth in the Word of God and from Church tradition, we know what we ought to do. Yet we doubt it, we fear the consequences, we fear what the world will say, and we give into the temptations of the world. We look at what‚Äôs good for the eye, good for the flesh, and pride ourselves in our wisdom.

The devil does not have his own clay, he just takes what God created and twists the truth into a lie. Satan will take half-truths and add lies to it and put doubt in our hearts, he is the father of lies.

‚ÄúHe was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù Jh 8:44

We sometimes give into the lies of the enemy and give into the temptations of the world. When we commit sin we tend to hide like Adam and Eve we try to cover our sin up.

7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7

I feel this is the first penance that Adam and Eve took on because as we all know fig leaves cause itch. This would have caused severe itch for Adam and Eve when they made loincloths with these leaves. I‚Äôm sure they were aware of this but they felt so upset with themselves and fearful.

Loved Fr Mike‚Äôs explanation of the tone of God for the verse ‚Äì ‚Äúwho told you you were naked?‚Äù The angry tone which most would assume compared to the sympathetic tone. God must have been really hurt - because we didn‚Äôt trust Him but believed the serpent instead.

Let us learn to trust God and his commandments. Man‚Äôs wisdom is foolishness to God, we should stop making up our own rules. If we decide that we can watch sports instead of worship on Sunday or that a fetus in the womb is just tissue ‚Äì we are listening to the lies of satan. We should listen to God‚Äôs voice and trust God fully.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 2 ‚Äì Alice To ###

Thoughts on action of Adam and the serpent:
1.	After creation, God has given Adam dominion over all animals (Gen 1:28). What Adam should have done when the serpent appeared before Eve was to rebuke it, protected Eve and cast the serpent out with his authority. Because of his inaction, Eve succumbed to temptation.
2.	The serpent is very clever. It did not do a direct onslaught. It just planted doubt in Eve‚Äôs mind by asking her a question. 
As a Christian, we should be aware of our God-given duty. We should always be aware of what our duty and mission is and adhere to it without fail or doubt because our God will not ask us to do things that we are not capable of and He will always be there to guide us along. We should also be aware that temptations, like the serpent will creep up on us without our being aware of it. We should always be vigilant. 
Pray each day for protection and guidance from the Holy Spirit and our Mama Mary.

### Day 2 By Cynthia D'Silva ###

Genesis 3:4-5 
*But the serpent said to the woman, ‚Äúyou will certainly not die.  God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, who knows good and evil.‚Äù* 
Satan did not change God‚Äôs word.  He cleverly twisted the Word and told Adam & Eve to look at God‚Äôs Word through his eyes.  
Instead of listening to the devil's interpretation of God‚Äôs Word, Eve should have consulted Adam, who knew better what commandment was given to him by God, and if Adam had any confusion he should have consulted his heavenly Father who gave him the commandment. 
We end up in the same situation when we try to interpret God‚Äôs Word on our own without guidance from those who have correct knowledge of the scriptures.

Genesis 3:15
*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.*
By this promise, God gave the guarantee of His divine assistance in protecting Mary and the Church (the Eucharist / the mystical Body of Christ) from Satan.  
By this promise it is evident that Mary and Jesus were immaculately conceived, that is, without original sin.  Mary‚Äôs holiness was confirmed by Angel Gabriel when he addressed Mary with the words "hail, full of grace‚Äù (‚Äúkecharitomene‚Äù in Greek) (Luke 1:28), which means that Mary was full of grace, like the first Eve before the fall.

[Genesis 3:22-24](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Genesis/3/22-24)

The Garden of Eden was a sanctuary / tabernacle where God dwelt with humans and Adam & Eve were told to leave the holy sanctuary because of the mortal sin which they both committed.
Mortal sin breaks our communion with God and results in ‚Äúspiritual death‚Äù which means ‚Äúeternal suffering (Hell) due to eternal separation from God.‚Äù
At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and ate the forbidden fruit, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).  
By this they instantly destroyed the divine life within them and consequently lost all the sanctifying graces which were necessary to perfect the human nature.  Thus they spiritually damaged and weakened the human soul, putting the human race in the power of Satan.  Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.  
The Church follows the same principle.
If we receive the fruit (Communion) from the tree of Life (the Cross) when we are in a state of mortal sin we will be subject to eternal damnation (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).  When we receive Communion in a state of grace we receive divine life which will give us eternal life after we leave this world (John 6:54).
