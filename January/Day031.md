### Day 31: “Instant prayers” ###

We are used to getting what we want almost immediately. Drive-through food, ATM - Any time money, Instant money transfer, Instant coffee, Instant Pot, expecting an immediate reply to your text, instant relief, etc.

We even expect God to respond immediately to our prayers, which does happen. However, sometimes God holds back his response/blessing so that we learn our life lessons. We need pain and suffering in our lives – for If we were self-sufficient, we would not need others or God. We would be focused on the physical world and not worry about our souls.

Pharoah got tired of the frogs, gnats, and flies – he told Moses that he would let God’s people go if Moses could stop the plagues. When Moses asked when Pharaoh said tomorrow. Pharoah’s heart was not ready – Moses and Arron – did the Miracle and stopped the plagues – but Pharoah did not keep up his end of the deal, he did not let the people go.

Sometimes when we receive answers to prayers too quickly – we are not really learning the lesson that we ought to. So let us not be in a hurry, let us petition the Lord and wait for Him to answer. In the expectant waiting – let us learn to love suffering and offer it up for our soul and for everyone else.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
