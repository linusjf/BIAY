### Day 4 *Why does God allow evil in the world?* - Michael Eltham ###

We read how Noah - who walked with God, also listened and did what the Lord commanded him to do. Even though the people around him were doing evil things, Noah did what was right and listened to the instructions of the Lord. Noah built a huge ark according to the detailed instructions from the Lord. Then the Lord asked Noah to take in two of each species of animal.

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him. Gen 6:22

Noah did not care about what the people were talking about him, he did not bother about their opinion. He just did the will of God and listened to the instructions God gave him, even if it seemed foolish or made no sense. Why build a big ark when there was never a flood before or there was no heavy rain? Imagine storing food for a lot of animals and getting them to come into the ark.

People would have laughed at him, but Noah did everything the Lord told him.

We are called to be not only hearers of the word but doers as well (James 1:22~). Also from Mat 7: Everyone who hears the word and does it is a wise man who built his house upon the rock - the rain and the flood did not cause the house to fall.

Noah was a hearer and a doer of the word as well, which is why the water did not destroy him and his family.

Water is used to cleanse things and the great flood wiped out all the evil generation. Only Noah and his family were saved. Because Noah listened to God‚Äôs word and acted upon it, he became a blessing to his family.

We need to be hearers and doers of God's word like Noah. Even if it is at the cost of the whole city laughing at us.

We use water to clean regular things and also used for baptism. John the Baptist called people to be baptized by water in order to prepare for Jesus‚Äôs coming. When Jesus was baptized in the river of Jordan, he was not cleansed by the water but the water was cleansed by Jesus‚Äôs divine touch. The next time we dip our fingers in holy water let us remember that it cleanses us, it‚Äôs sacramental. Just as the flood waters cleansed the human race at a point like John the Baptist baptized in water to prepare us for Jesus, and just as blood and ‚Äúwater‚Äù poured out of the side of Jesus for the purification of the Church. We were baptized and made clean ‚Äì grafted into the body of Christ, the Church.

The image to remember is the Rainbow, it‚Äôs the promise that God made to Noah and to each one of us that He will never destroy us again.

‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. Gen 8:21

I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù 17 God said to Noah, ‚ÄúThis is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù Gen 9: 3-17

The Rainbow is symbolic of God putting down his bow and deciding to never ever destroy us. This is an answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy does God allow evil in the world?‚Äù God is patient and will not act harshly to destroy all evil people. God is patient and hopes that even the evilest people will repent.

God re-established the covenant that he had with Adam, he makes a new covenant with Noah and blesses them ‚ÄúGod blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.‚Äù Gen 9:1

One would think that humans would learn from their mistakes, but no we keep on failing and breaking the covenant over and over again through generations. God did not just destroy all mankind but loved us even more, and sent Jesus ‚Äì His only begotten son.

God will not destroy us but love us more, love us until we repent and turn to Him. Let us not hurt God too much, return to His arms.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 4 Anonymous ###

1. The foundation between God and man is interwoven with reminder of God's gift of human life.  God forbids murder of man.

2. God says you can eat of the animals.  Animals are God 's creatures.  God entrusted animals to the stewardship of human beings.  And it is contrary to human dignity to be cruel to them.  This is an issue which troubled me a lot, when I saw humans attacking animals mercilessly.

3. God loves His creation and creatures and we have to be obedient to His commandments. We should never question His ways because He created us and He knows  what is best for us.  I seek pardon for the times I have knowingly or unknowingly questioned.God, why He created animals to suffer at human hands?

All Glory  to The Most Holy Trinity!

Genesis 7:1
Noah started building the ark 100 years before the flood started and not when it started to drizzle or rain.  When God said ‚Äúget in‚Äù Noah was so ready.
How ready are we if God says tomorrow ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come home?‚Äù
Are we ready or would we start running around looking for a priest to make our last confession?
We must be ready for eternal lie every day of our earthly life, by being in a state of grace at all times with regular Confession and Communion.
