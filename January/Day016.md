### Day 16: "If God is for us who can be against us" Rom 8:31 -Michael Eltham ###

In today's reading Jacob hears God's voice calling him back to his Father's house - remember Jacob left in fear after stealing the blessing from his elder brother Esau. In a sense, Jacob had to deal with his deceptive and manipulative father-in-law Laban for many years. No matter how Laban tried to steal by changing what type of cattle belonged to him, God kept prospering Jacob's flock.

Finally, Jacob stirred by God's message decided to take all that he had and leave. Laban persuaded him "BUT" the Lord had put a hedge around Jacob. Laban could not lay a hand on Jacob(Because the Lord told Laban not to). "If the Lord is for us who can be against us". "No harm will come near our tent" "A thousand may fall on your right 10K on your left - but nothing can befall us" "No weapon formed against us shall prosper" and "He puts His angels in charge of us" "They patrol around us day and night" In the reading, we see Jacob meets the army of Angles. Let us not fear, but take refuge in the Lord. "He is our fortress and stronghold. In His arms we are safe."

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
