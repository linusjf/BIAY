### Day23: “Keep hold of instruction, do not let go” - Michael Eltham ###

 “Walk in the path of the righteous and you will never stumble” 

The proverb we hear today is so true. The only qualification to get to heaven is to be a saint, yes to be a “saint”. We are not born saints, we are born with original sin and the urge to sin is always with us. We read in Romans 7:14-15

“I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate...”

However, we should not just give into our own desires, but detest sin and follow Christ. It’s not just about following rules, it’s all about loving the Lord (“ If you love me you will keep my commandments” Jh 14:15) If we love the Lord and try our very best to be holy, He will pour His love into Hearts through the Holy Spirit. He will write His laws on our hearts, and we will follow them out of love, not out of compulsion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 23 - Jenita ###

everyone and everything changes in time. A broken heart, broken relationship, people, situations, everything changes in time with the grace of God. 

Although Judah indulged in inappropriate activities, knowingly or unknowingly, the stains on his reputation are erased in these chapters from Genesis. We see how he is looked at as one who takes responsibility over his family by pledging his life for them. 

Situations change. 

Similarly although we may feel that this particular incident in our lives has led to a very unfavorable situation, when it is surrendered to God, everything will work in our favour. 

He is the God who restores.
