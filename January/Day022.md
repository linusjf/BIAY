### Day22: ‚ÄúGo to Joseph‚Äù - Michael Eltham ###

We read such a beautiful story of Gods providence today. God uses Joseph to provide for his family. Joseph was sold by his brother, falsely accused by his masters wife and eventually thrown in Jail. One would think that it‚Äôs the end of the road for him. But our God can bring streams in the desert vegetation in dry land. He does lift up Joseph by giving him the ability to interpret dreams. Now Joseph becomes the one who saves literally the whole world as there was a famine in the whole world. He literally was the defender of bread during the drought. Isn‚Äôt he similar to St Joseph who also flees to Egypt with Mary and defended the baby Jesus - the bread of life. One of the titles of Joseph is the worker - he worked hard to provide for Jesus - also the OT Joseph is a great worker as he worked for 7 years to collect grain so much grain that they were not able to measure it. Let us learn from these two great men in the Bible and be defenders of Jesus - the bread of life. Let us be defenders of the faith. 

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè
