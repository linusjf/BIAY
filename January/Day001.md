### Day1 *We have God in our DNA* - Michael Eltham ###

The Bible opens with this great scene of creation, it reveals a bit of God’s nature – God existed before all things and is the source of everything good, everything we know and understand. We see a glimpse of God’s nature, God is generous - keeps on creating and pouring life into this world. God creates an ordered and good world and puts everything in place and sets rules and boundaries. There is something to be learned from how God organized this world and set it in motion, we should also organize our lives, and set rules and boundaries based on the church's teachings and Sacred Scripture. When we live an organized, harmonious life we feel good, the reason being we were created by God in His own “image” and “likeness” – we experience wholeness when we have things in order.

Man and woman were created as the "crown of creation" – because we are created in God’s image and likeness.

26 Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; Gen 1:26

One important detail here is God said “Let us make humankind”, we have a Trinitarian God – God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not alone, but a harmonious community of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, they are in such beautiful unity that there is no strife or disagreement – but with one mind they all create this beautiful world.

We see a reference to the Holy Spirit, a wind from God, that is the breath of God – the Holy Spirit.

The Hebrew word "Ruach" means “wind,” “breath,” or “spirit.” The corresponding Greek word is pneuma. Both words are commonly used in passages referring to the Holy Spirit.

We see the power of the Word of God, with just one Word – things were created. The Word of God will have this effect on us as we study it every day in the Bible in a year program. It will create in us an orderly world, setting priorities right and we will end up living a harmonious life in union with the Holy Trinity.

God put his breath into us, and the Holy Spirit was put into our hearts.

then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. Gen 2:7

Since we are created in God’s image and likeness, we receive our good attributes and dignity from God. We have God’s nature in our DNA, and we naturally have love in our hearts, for Example, a mother naturally loves her newborn and does not need to be taught how to love.

It is at "creation" that the “dignity of life” is given to all human beings, that is why every human being has the dignity of life.

Every human being has the dignity of life because we are created in God’s image and likeness and God’s Spirit/breath was put into us. We should never discriminate based on skin color, race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, every single one in created in God’s image and likeness.

The explanation of the word “helper” helps to put things in perspective. God is called helper several times in the Bible and hence helper is not meant to be second class or someone who did menial tasks. Women and Men are both created equal in the image and likeness of God. Let us respect all human beings as everyone has the dignity of life and both men and women are equal. 

God does not have Gender – we cannot say that God is man or woman. We cannot even categorize God based on gender, God is our creator and He was even before Gender came into this world, God created gender when He made Adam – man and Eve – woman. When God was incarnate, He was born as a man for a reason. The reason is Jesus is the new Adam, and we the church is the new eve, created from Jesus’ side when his side was pierced. Blood and water flowed out, life-giving blood and water that gave birth to the new Eve – the Church.

Side Note: It will help us understand Genesis should if we did not read it chronologically or like a scientific book. Genesis does not aim to give a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe, it’s more like figurative language to describe real events.

That’s how the two events(Gen 1 and Gen 2) of the creation of man can be explained. Also things like “how God created light and darkness on day 1 and sun and moon on day 3”. It is best understood if we read it in figurative language.

Finally, we realize that God is the source of everything good, this should remind us to put him first in everything - He is the beginning. The Alpha and Omega.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 1 - creation - Irene ###

Something which struck me was 

1. God is our Creator. He made us we are his creation the work of his hands.

2. God is good.  Everything that He has created is good. 

3.He is our source and provider.  He has given us everything even before He made us.

4. God is our Helper our ever present help in every need.

5. He is a master planner putting every detail in place.

Our God is an awesome God 

Praise God the Father
Praise God the Son
Praise God the Holy Spirit the triune God.
