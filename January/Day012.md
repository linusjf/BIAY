### Day 12: *Dedication to daily devotion and work.* - Michael Eltham ###

The story of Isaac and Rebekah seems so smooth and as though they had a full revelation of God‚Äôs plan for their lives. But it was not so - it only seems so to the readers of their story.

Abraham commissioned his servant to go find a bride from among his own people (Israelites, relatives) as they were staying in pagan land. The servant prayed the below prayer.

While I stand here at the spring and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water,

14if I say to a young woman, ‚ÄòPlease lower your jug, that I may drink,‚Äô and she answers, ‚ÄòDrink, and I will water your camels, too,‚Äô then she is the one whom you have decided upon for your servant Isaac. In this way I will know that you have dealt graciously with my master.‚Äù Gen 24:13-14

Until the day when Abraham's servant went in search of a bride, Rebekah was doing her mundane tasks of fetching water from the well. We heard the story she kindly gave a drink to servant and his camels. She was willing to even go with the servant to a far off place to meet Isaac.

One day toward evening he went out to walk in the field, and caught sight of camels approaching. Gen 24:63

Until the day the servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac would go to the fields to meditate and pray. Walk in the field can be related to praising God like God walked with Adam and even in the garden of Eden. "In the evening" is a time of rest when the day‚Äôs work is done and one turns to worship.

Sometimes while waiting for God to answer our prayer, we get impatience and complain and crib about the situation. Like Job we don't see God's providence working in our lives - we only see all the problems and misfortunes in our life. We even wonder why this is happening to me.

We are called to persevere in prayer like Isaac, daily drawing from the well - like Rebekah, we need to draw from the well of the Sacraments - Eucharist, Confession, the Bible, personal prayer, community prayer.

Even if we don't understand what‚Äôs going on like Job, we need to keep on doing the right thing and the Lord will provide. We will see at the end of the book of Job, how the Lord provides - much more than what Job initially had.

But for now, we need to keep journeying with Job and feel the pain and struggle.

Let's keep trusting in God's providence.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 12 Anonymous ###

God's providence is always at work.
How powerfully we rely on God's providence, even when we don't see.
God is faithful, even when we are unfaithful and He provides.

### Day 12 - Jenita ###

God sends the right people at the right time and at the right place in our lives.

We only need to tell him our hearts desires and he will make wonders according to his will in our lives.

He only wants us to trust the e tire process

"One foot forward"

This is all we need to do..  Trust and serve God even on the dark days, know that he is there even when we are in the darkness.

\*Trust the process\*
