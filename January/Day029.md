### Day 29: "Finding excuses" - Michael Eltham ###

Moses had an excuse for everything the Lord asked him to do. Some of his questions 

•	“ God – What’s your name/ Who are you?”

•	“Who am I?” 

•	 “If I go to the Israelites, “What if they won’t believe me? ”

•	 “I’m not eloquent with words.”

 Even though the Lord showed him two Miracles – ‘one with the staff turning into a snake’ and ‘the healing of leprosy ‘Moses said – “send someone else” Even though the Great I AM said he would be with Moses – Moses made excuses. The scripture says that God was angry. 

Ex 4:14 “Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses”

We may have a bunch of excuses, not enough time or not enough resources blah blah blah. Enough of blaming others and making excuses – it’s time to get tough on ourselves. We need to sit down and reflect on the excuses we make when the Lord calls us to do something.

I’m too old, I’m too young, "I’m shy", "I have the wrong background", "If I only was more social", "If I was healthier", "If it wasn’t for the Virus:"….“I’m too busy”

Speaking of “I’m too Busy”. When Pharoah found out that the Israelites wanted to take 3 days off to Worship the Lord, he said they had no work and gave them more work.

Do we have Pharaohs in our lives, or is part of us Pharaoh itself? When our soul yearns for the Lord, we come up with so many chores and tasks – that we neglect "dedicated Worship time "for the Lord. Let us stop making excuses and start worshiping the great I AM.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
