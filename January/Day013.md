### Day 13 Selling our inheritance for temporal pleasure ###

Isaac and Rebecca were happily married but they did not have any children. God had promised Abraham descendants as many as the stars in the sky so it‚Äôs really important that Isaac has children. Although Abraham had children with Hagar his servant and other concubines, the lineage for Jesus should come through Abraham and Isaac. As we journey through the Bible we will see how the lineage is established from Adam to Jesus.

We will see how Isaac‚Äôs son Jacob will have 12 sons who‚Äôs descendants will become the 12 tribes of Israel.

Isaac entreated the LORD on behalf of his wife, since she was sterile. The LORD heard his entreaty, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.

But the children jostled each other in the womb so much that she exclaimed, ‚ÄúIf it is like this, why go on living!‚Äù She went to consult the LORD,

23and the LORD answered her:

Two nations are in your womb, two peoples are separating while still within you;

But one will be stronger than the other,

and the older will serve the younger. Gen 25:21-23

Right from conception the situation seems like the twins will always be at odds, jostling each other, one is stronger and one older will serve the younger. Even at birth, we see the younger one Jacob holding on to the heel of Esau.

The first to emerge was reddish, and his whole body was like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.

26Next his brother came out, gripping Esau‚Äôs heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. Gen 25: 25-26

Esau was a good hunter and Jacob was a simple man, Rebecca preferred Jacob and Isaac Esau because he was fond of the game he caught.

Once, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.

30He said to Jacob, ‚ÄúLet me gulp down some of that red stuff; I am famished.‚Äù That is why he was called Edom.

31But Jacob replied, ‚ÄúFirst sell me your right as firstborn.‚Äù

32‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Esau, ‚ÄúI am on the point of dying. What good is the right as firstborn to me?‚Äù

33But Jacob said, ‚ÄúSwear to me first!‚Äù So he sold Jacob his right as firstborn under oath.

Gen 25:29-33

Esau did not regard his firstborn right too much which is why he sold it a meal. Also Jacob wanted to sneak his way into the blessing that was meant for Esau the eldest.

The only outcome I can draw from this is that we humans are broken, we can place ourselves in the shoes of both brothers. We are so greedy that we want to get anything we see or desire. We are also so negligent about our inheritance, we so easily sell our birthright as children of God for something very temporal and fleeting.

We are blinded like Esau and can only see the temporal benefits instead of the great blessings of being a child of God. We sell our inheritance for petty sins of greed, lust, pride‚Ä¶

Let us preserve our inheritance of being God‚Äôs children, never giving into the glitter of temporal pleasure. This world and all its pleasures are passing away.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 13 - Gabriella ###

Dear Lord, 
Teach us and inspire us to recognize our own brokenness and to avoid repeating what our ancestors have done over and over. Help us recognize our own wrongdoings and take the path you have planned for us. 

In your eyes Lord it must be a precious moment lost in eternity when we abuse your goodness and freewill.  

_Have mercy on us O Lord, have mercy on us!_
