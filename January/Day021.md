### Day 21: "Joseph the just" - Michael Eltham ###

We see so many similarities between Joseph of the Old Testament and our dear St Joseph of the New Testament. Both had dreams and God communicated with them very clearly in their dreams. Both were forced to go to Egypt. Both were just men. We see how OT Joseph is chaste and does not succumb to the repeated advances of his master‚Äôs wife, he even fled from her.

St Joseph of the NT is called out as a just man in the NT. According to tradition he had pledged his virginity to the Lord and wanted to live a life dedicated to the Lord‚Äôs service. We need to learn from both the Josephs to preserve our life from ‚Äúthe lust of the eyes, the lust of the world and pride of life.‚Äù

We need to flee from sin. ‚ÄùBe alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour ‚Äù 1Pet5:8

Also do not fear, for the Lord is always with us. We see how the Lord was on Joseph‚Äôs side no matter how bad the situation was. Whatever Joseph did he prospered because the Lord was on his side. It‚Äôs the same with us, the Lord is on our side.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 21- Jenita ###

Joseph goes through tremendous tribulations..  He is betrayed, backstabbed, sold, falsely accused.. But still through it all.. He is calm because of his trust in the Lord. And that trust is strong because God is always with him.

Similarly, we too need to realize that.. No matter what happens in life... God is with us.. God constantly is walking with us every single second of our lives. And that is the ultimate comfort and assurance of peace one can ever rely on.
