### Day 78 “Listen to the right music – it impacts us” “The one who sings prays twice"

I’m sure you have had a song stuck in your head, usually, it’s the refrain of a song or a line or the melody that keeps playing nonstop and you can’t get it out of your head. More than 90% of adults report that this happens to them at least once a week. Research suggests that songs may get stuck due to repetitive lyrics that activate the brain's reward system. There is some interesting science about how music can affect us, it stirs up emotions and memories and even leads us to do certain actions.

We see that the Lord who created and programmed us, uses this faculty of the human being – God knew that after Moses' death, the Israelites would fall into sin again, even after they enter the promised land and received everything they needed, they would still sin. God gave Moses a song that the people would sing and memories and get stuck in their heads. This was preparation for the time they would fall into sin and then this song would remind them of God’s goodness and they would return to God.

In the desert wondering, most of the commandments would have been taught verbally and they would call an assembly of the people are read the commandments of the Lord over and over again.

I think we should learn something from this, if we listen to music with very a negative message or hate, we will eventually become that. If we listen to Christian music that has the word of God in its lyrics, we will praise God while we listen and the songs and lyrics will also get stored in our brain and be brought up when we need it.

I listen to good music, even when I’m working – the brain is powerful enough to praise God and work at the same time. Let us find some good Christina music and binge-listen.

Not only listen, but we also got to sing it as well. Don’t worry if you don’t have a good voice.

The bible says - Make a joyful noise

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:

be thankful unto him, and bless his name. PS 100:1,4

St. Augustine had this very famous saying

“The one who sings prays twice”.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
