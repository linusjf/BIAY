### Day 77 ‚ÄúBe strong and of good courage ‚Äì the Lord goes with you, He will not fail you or forsake you‚Äù

Moses is getting up in age and it‚Äôs time for him to pass. Moses has lived a long life, a life of service ‚Äì he was brought up in royalty ‚Äì the Lord led him out of that comfortable life and made him the leader of the Israelites ‚Äì he spent most of his life in the wilderness ‚Äì the people of Israel have been revolting, complaining and falling into sin over and over again. God even tells Moses that after he dies the people are going to go back into sin and forsake the Lord. Even though the Lord will lead them into the promised land, the land flowing with milk and honey ‚Äì they will despise Him even in their prosperity.

For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant. Deut 31:20

BUT ‚Äì even though the people backslide and give in to their own desires ‚Äì God is faithful He is fighting for them and will never ever leave them. Even though we are unfaithful, God is faithful. He will remember His covenant from generation to generation. Even though we sin He is merciful. The Psalmist proclaims this in today‚Äôs Psalm

For great is his mercy towards us; and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Ps 117

If we examine our own lives, we see the same pattern of sin. We have complaints and grumbling when things go wrong, when we get sick or have so sufferings ‚Äì we forsake the Lord. Even when we are prosperous, we forget the Lord, just like the Israelites who were given everything a land flowing with milk and honey ‚Äì yet they turned to other gods and served them. So we cannot blame our circumstances or condition as we forsake the Lord when we are "in need" and when we are "full".

Our God loves us despite our sinfulness and shortcomings.

Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person‚Äîthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. Rom 5:7

Let us not be discouraged by our sin, but encouraged by God‚Äôs mercy and faithfulness. Let's remember this famous quote from St Faustina.

The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. - St Faustina

We need to read those words that Moses used to encourage Joshua. Maybe read it a few times and be encouraged today that God is Merciful and Faithful.

Be strong and of good courage, do not fear or be in dread of them: for it is the Lord your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you.‚Äù Deut 31:6

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
