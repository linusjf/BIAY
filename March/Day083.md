### Day 83 Strategy and deception

We see how Joshua was instructed to use a Military ambush strategy to conquer Ai. Just yesterday we read how Ai defeated the Israelites because the Lord was not with them. The Lord can use our mistakes and write straight with crooked lines, the Lord asked Joshua to set ambush soldiers and then flee as they did the previous time, once the Ai men started following the fleeing Israelites the Ambush soldiers would go in and set the city on fire. The Lord used the mistakes of the Israelites to bring victory. We also read of the hasty decision that the Israelites made towards making a covenant with the Gibeonites, the Gibeonites deceived the Israelites pretending to have come from far away. However, the Lord blesses this decision and graphs the Gibeonites into the Israelites. We will see how the Gibeonites will bear very useful people in the future.

In our lives we may have made wrong decisions may be married the wrong person, took up the wrong job, wasted out family inheritance, did bad things when we were young ‚Äì like drugs/alcohol/guns, maybe even have a criminal record. Let us not be disheartened but entrust everything to the Lord for our God can use our scares to bring healing to the nations.

All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose: Romans 8:28

Also, we need to have a strategy to defeat our enemies, our enemy is sin and the devil. We need to learn how to avoid sin, for example ‚Äì if you struggle with sins of gossip, then give yourself a time limit when you talk about others or choose to never name people ‚Äì use words like us instead of him/her.

If you struggle with lust, then ensure you are never along with your devices.

If you struggle with anger, then have a strategy to never speak until you calm down.

Come up with a strategy to fight and burn up sin in our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
