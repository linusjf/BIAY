### Day 76 “The freedom to choose – Choose life”

We read in today’s reading about choice, God gives us a choice, He could have just created us like rocks, trees, or wild animals that only have instinct. We have a rationale or reason and a choice, a choice to do good or bad to pick God or Evil.

The Catechism teaches

CCC 1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him."26

I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, 20 loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the Lord swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. Deuteronomy 30:19-20

In today’s scripture reading, we see God laying it out very clearly – He says that we need to pick either good or bad, life or death, blessing or curses. The choices we make allow God to save us. We are saved by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and resurrection – but we need to choose Jesus over sin. God will empower us to live a holy life and make good choices. Choices that bring blessings and a future in heaven. We need to make choices in life – choices that are pro-life and not pro-death, pro-choice at every stage from conception to natural death.

Our first parents Adam and Eve had a choice – but they messed up they picked evil over good – they listened to what the devil said over what God said. Even though they messed up – God gave us many more changes – which the Israelites kept messing up. Eventually, God gave us a new Eve – Mary who said “Yes” to God, and a new Adam – Jesus who said Yes to the will of the Father.

If we find ourselves in a place where we have made bad choices, let’s not fret – we need to return to God.

return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you Deut 30:2-3

We need to choose God, blessings flow when we choose God.

Psalm 91 starts with “He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High ” then the many blessings of protection are listed, but we need to dwell in Him first.

Also, Psalm 23 starts with – “The Lord is my shepherd” We need to make the Lord our shepherd which will bring many blessings – we will not be in need, He will make us lie down in green pastures, our cup will overflow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
