### Day 67 Anonymous

You care for justice, You care for us. Thank You Lord!

All the tribes of Israel were given land, property, etc. as their inheritance. But Levites were not given any inheritance, because The Lord Himself was their inheritance. The tithes would be given to them for their support and food.
Levites also have to give a tenth of their tithes from what they are receiving as tithes.
Wars of judgement
People of Cannan were living violent lives. God is using people of Israel to exact justice
You need to be faithful because thru you I am going to bless the people. God gives commandment knowing they wouldn't keep them.

### Reflection - Cathy Aggarao

This makes me reflect how priests come from a family, first. And the importance of making our family a domestic church. The active participation of families in parish and sacramental life leads to more young ones entering religious life or faithful professionals. I like how we are called to be sensitive to the needs of the religious and priesthood since we benefit from their works.
üôèMother Mary, please pray for more youth to be open to religious and priestly life. Amen.
