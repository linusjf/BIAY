### Day 79: “Moses’ great example to "Bless those who curse you"”

As we read the final blessing of Moses, Man-O-Man what a gem of a person Moses. The people of Israel were not “happy campers” they companied, and they accused Moses of so many things – they were afraid that the Egyptian army would kill them, complaints about lack of water, food, no meat, no garlic, fear of fighting tribes with tall people, they were a people that never headed Moses’ words(God’s instruction) and stiff-necked people.

But Moses did not count all their failures and say "you cursed people, you ruined my life, I could not even see the promised land". Instead, Moses blesses them, and does not curse them. There is a lesson to learn, we are called to bless and not curse.

Even if people are hard to handle and can get in our hair, we must have a heart like Moses that blesses and not curses. We need a heart of Jesus that is able to say “Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing”

bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 29 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak do not withhold your coat as well. Luke 6:28-29

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
