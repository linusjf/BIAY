### Day 91 Losing track of our goal.

We read the story of Gideon, the story has a lot of heroic movements and signs and wonders.

We see that Gideon asks the correct questions to the angel.

13 Gideon answered him, ‚ÄúBut sir, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, ‚ÄòDid not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?‚Äô But now the Lord has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian.‚Äù Judeges 6:13

Then he asks for signs ‚Äì the first sign is for the food to be consumed and there was fire from the rock. There was the next sign about the dew falling on the fleece of the wool and the drying up of the same. The Lord answered him every time and even gave him strength like no other ‚Äì Gideon was a nobody and the Lord granted him victory over great kings.

However, the sad part of the story is Gideon was not successful in riding the Israelites of idol worship as he took the loot-gold and made it into a molten image which became another idol, and after his death, the Israelites went back to idol worship, in fact, this time they made a Baal of the covenant - Ba‚Ä≤al-be‚Ä≤rith their God - Baal in the image of Yahweh.

We need to be very careful to live out our whole life for the Lord. Sometimes we start strong and lose our goal by the end of our life. Let us learn a life lesson from Gideon, we should not end our lives like Gideon but like St Paul, who was able to say.

‚ÄúI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith‚Äù 2 Tim 4:7

Let us hope and pray that our goal should always be to do the will of the Father.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
