### Day 74 “Men and women are equal – both created in God’s image”

We see in today’s reading the daughters of Zelophehad - 5 of them came forward to demand equality for inheritance. Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah come up before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

What courage they must have had – to take a stand before the congregation.

“Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons. 4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father’s brothers.” Numbers 27:3,4

Moses needed to seek God’s guidance on this and sure enough the Lord said – yes Men and women are equal – the daughters should be given their due.

Moses brought their case before the Lord. 6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 7 The daughters of Zelophehad are right in what they are saying; you shall indeed let them possess an inheritance among their father’s brothers and pass the inheritance of their father on to them. Numbers 27:5-8

When God created man and women – He made no difference between the two. He created them both in His image.

So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. Gen 1:27

In Jesus’ earthly life he always took up for women the widows the orphans. Many women were his followers and supporters. Two of his good friends were Mary and Martha – and their brother Lazarus. Scripture scholars believed that Lazarus was physically challenged or very sick. The Greek word "asthenes" can be translated as "sick," "without strength," "feeble" or "insignificant."

Due to his condition, Lazarus was unable to care for the family and his sisters were not married because they had to care for Lazarus. Jesus loved them so dearly and cared for them – even brought back Lazarus to life.

Our God created everyone equal, men and women, black, white and brown, short, tall, weak, strong, smart, simple, special, normal. Jesus loves us all the same.

Let us stop hate or discrimination – we are called to love as God loves. Love everyone equally.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
