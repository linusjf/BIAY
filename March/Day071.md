### Day 71 “If the Lord opens a door no one can close it” ###

We see Balak just won’t give up, he makes Balaam try again and again. Even though they build multiple alters and offer bulls and rams – the Lord will not change, what is man that he can attempt to change God’s mind/will.

As we live our Christian lives – we will have a lot of resistance, pushback, and even opposition. Do not worry the Lord is on our side, God is fighting for us.

Like Balak and Balaam, anyone against us (God’s chosen people) will have to say.

“He can I curse who God has not cursed” v8

“ Behold I receive a command to bless; he has blessed and I cannot revoke it ”v20 Numbers 23

Remember that nothing will happen to us that the Lord does not allow.

“No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from Me,” Says the Lord” (Isaiah 54:17).

Our God is for us and on our side, what can man do.

31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Rom 8

Just how – no nation could stop God’s people from entering the promised land. No one can close the door the Lord has opened in your life.

“Brave Soldier - Be positive, look up, and move on. He is with us. “

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
