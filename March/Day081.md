### Day 81 ‚ÄúStack up stones of good memories, remember what the Lord has done‚Äù

Human tendency is to forget, forget the good things that have been done to us. One usually clings to negative things or experiences. The people of Israel started their journey with the parting of the Red Sea ‚Äì it was a great miracle and one to be remembered forever. However, the people forgot it too soon, they kept doubting the Lord and complaining from time to time. Now the Lord our faithful God has journeyed with them, guiding them by smoke and fire every step of the way. The Lord also prepared their hearts to enter the promised land, they were given the 10 commandments and detailed instructions on moral law, details about worship. They are ready to enter the promised land ‚Äì a land flowing with milk and honey.

The desert wanderings started with the parting of the read sea and ends with the parting of the Jordan ‚Äì as soon as the feet of those carrying the Tabernacle entered the Jordan the river stopped flowing (again this should not be assumed as low tide/water ‚Äì there is a mention that the Jordan usually overflowed its banks) - the Lord commanded each tribe to pick one stone from the dept of the banks of the river Jordan ‚Äì to remind them that the Lord did dry up the Jordan. This would be a memory for generations to come so that the Israelites would remember the faithfulness of the Lord. Just as each tribe picked up one stone from the depts of the Jordan, we need to pick up something when we are going through the depts/difficult times(sickness, job loss, losing a loved one, etc) ‚Äì to remember that the Lord has brought us through it.

We need to have some way to remember the good things the Lord has done for us. Just as we pick up souvenirs when we visit a new place. A prayer journal is a good idea, highlighting your bible, writing up reflections. I have all my reflections from day 1 till now stored in a file, I plan to read them as I go through the BIAY again maybe in 2024, (if Ascension does the catechism in a year in 2023)

We need to memorize the word of God as well, as the Lord commanded to write them on the doorposts and on your garments. We need to read and re-read the living word of God until it is written on our hearts.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 81 Maryanne C.M

- A new Beginning,  A New Leader, Another Crossing over the River. Praise God.
- Joshua 1:9 is a Command not an option: " I hereby command you:Be strong and courageous, do not be frightened or dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
- Praise God, He goes with us therefore we must be Strong and Courageous!
  Amen.üôè

### Day 81 -  Jenita

üé∂"God will make a way, where there seems to be no way"üé∂

This song certainly rings a jingle in my head, as it very much speaks of how God does the unimaginable to make us move forward in this journey of life.

Whatever maybe our situation, whatever be our position in life.. We must remember that we serve a faithful God who does marvelous miracles which cannot be explained by human intelligence. We serve a God will will move mountains and part seas and rivers just so we can go into green pastures.

We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we in testing times we may look at these rocks(miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope.

He will never leave us nor forsake us! !!

What a mighty God we serve

### Day 81 - Gabriella

Commenting on *Jenita‚Äôs* note above, I totally agree with her heartfelt reflection.

*We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we are in testing times we may look at these rocks (miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope.*

These words reminded me of our Lord‚Äôs
üåπBlessed Mother, Our Lady Undoer of Knots Novena, meditation part for day 4 as it reads:

*O Mother, ask Jesus to heal my paralytic faith which gets down hearted with the stones on the road.*

\*Along with you, dearest Mother, may I see these stones as friends. Not murmuring against them anymore but giving endless thanks for them, may I smile trustingly in your power.\*‚Ä®‚Ä®\_*Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Mary is the Sun and no one is deprived of her warmth.*\_

Praise God for His steadfast love and mercy through Her endless intercession!

*Deuteronomy 31:8*
‚ÄúThe LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.‚Äù
