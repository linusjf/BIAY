### Day 70 “God’s perfect will and permissive will”, “Talking donkey and angels - what? ”

We read about Balaam the soothsayer/prophet, going against the Lord’s command. Balaam initially accepted the Lord’s instruction about not cursing God’s chosen (this was God’s perfect will) and when Balaam was influenced with more money and influential people, he gave in. The Lord said OKAY you can go but you will say what I tell you (God’s permissive will).

We encounter this every day in our lives, we know what God wants of us – but we get influenced by this world – money and famous people tell us what to do. Even in the big decisions in life we tend to avoid God’s call – someone called to the religious life avoids it and regrets it later – the Lord is faithful even if we are not – he never leaves us and gives us the freedom to choose. Let us periodically spend time to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit to discern God’s will and let’s pray for the grace to accept His perfect will in our lives.

Like Jonah, the Lord will eventually take us on the path He predestined for us. The only difference is – if we listen to God’s voice we will have less resistance - less time in the fish's belly.

We see this incredible miracle of a talking donkey – the common knowledge is that donkeys are dumb animals. However we see that the dumb one was the human being, in this case, the donkey's eyes were opened to see the angel – with the drawn sword – the donkey was so good – trying to save Balaam’s life and its own I guess. We so often forget the spiritual realm. There are angels around us – our guardian angel and other angels that protect us.

For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways;
12 they will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. Ps 91

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
and he delivers them. Ps 34

Let us be aware of the lovely angels around us and don’t forget to pet your dog/cat. 😀

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
