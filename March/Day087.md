### Day 87 The City of Refuge, the slap that was heard around the world and Ukraine - Michael Eltham

If we remember ‚Äúthe slap that was heard around the world.‚Äù I not going to say who‚Äôs right and wrong, I feel both had their part to play. There are positives ‚Äì Chris Rock wanted people to laugh and be cheerful, and Will smith was just protective of his wife. However, the thing that was surprising was that it happened at the Oscars, it‚Äôs is not the place for violence. Human beings can‚Äôt be predicted, they say things that shouldn‚Äôt be said, people snap, angry becomes fury in seconds.
God creates cities of refuge because He knows how fragile human beings are. The city of refuge was meant to be a place where there is no violence. If someone kills another person by accident ‚Äì there needs to be a place where they can hide from those seeking vengeance. We need to be grateful that we live in a far more civilized world, with police and armed forces and governments.
However, this security is violated sometimes ‚Äì leaders like Putin seem to be getting away with violating the basic human freedom that the Ukrainians should be allowed to have. Power, Pleasure, and Pride are the big three P‚Äôs that seem to be the driving force behind all evil people.
The rest of the world needs to be a city of Refuge for the Ukrainian people. We should protect them from physical harm and help them heal emotionally. We see similar situations in Haiti and with the situation in Gaza/Isreal.
Let us also be a city of refuge for our friends and family who are suffering. Let us be available to them, be a shoulder to cry on, always gave a listening heart, support them and help them as needed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 87

Today we learn that Joshua and Caleb were the only two men who experienced the wandering and conquest in the leaving of Egypt.
The practice of taking one's life was a long feud to settle, hence asylum were established to provide for those accidental cases.
Besides the Levites, priests were given free allotments of land as they were to teach God's Law to the people.
God fulfilled the promised to the lsraelites even in the midst of hardship and sufferings.
Hence the Psalm brings calmness and hope. When a soul with gratitude asks for forgiveness and deliverance, God forgives and gives confidence to those who wait confidently and expectantly for Him.
