### Day 82 Holding on to sin

We are all aware of the fall of Jericho, the great and fortified city that was standing in the way of the Israelites entering the promised land. An angel with a drawn sword appeared to Joshua and said the same thing that was said to Moses at the start of Moses Exodus ‚Äì ‚ÄúPut off the shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy‚Äù. Joshua like Moses in the burning bush experienced a closeness to the Lord, something that would help them lead the people confidently.

The Lord gave Joshua special instructions to march around the city with the ark of the covenant for 7 days with trumpet blasts and on day 7 the walls of Jericho would fall. I guess we do similar prayers when we take the Eucharistic Lord in processions around the neighborhood.

The Lord instructed the Israelites not to take anything from the land that they conquered, lest these things defile them. However, Achan was lured into collecting some of the spoils. Because of his sin, the Lord was not with Israel when they attempted to capture this tiny hill city of Ai. The sin of Achan caused 36 good Israelites to be slain by the Ai. Even after seeing this Achan did not come forth, his sin had to be revealed by the Lord. That is when they had to stone Achan in the valley of Achor (trouble/sadness/destruction/shame), let us be reminded that it is our own sin that brings destruction, God does not want to see us get hurt or lose our soul.

Let us take a life lesson from this, we should not hold on to certain sins. One usually tends to hold onto a few favorite sins, the ones we really enjoy. Let us pray for the strength to let go of the things of the world, lest we lose our souls.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
