### Day 62: “Family Feud”

JOKE ALERT: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ 😁
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses’ wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it’s important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What’s important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick – the differences disappeared the brothers united – Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏
