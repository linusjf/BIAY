### Day 181 Try not to be reluctant like Jonah because God‚Äôs mercy is never-ending.

The word that stands out with prophet Jonah is reluctant, from starting to end. We all know the story of Jonah and the whale. He was called to go to Nineveh and preach repentance to them. But he fled the opposite way, he hopped on a ship to Tarshish. It‚Äôs not like he got the wrong ship, because the trip to Nineveh was a road trip approx. 550 miles on land, he jumped in a ship that was going 1500 miles in the other direction. He wanted to go as far away as possible from God‚Äôs calling. He is so reluctant that he wanted to run away even away from God‚Äôs presence. We know he learned that hard way ‚Äì in the stinky gut of the whale for 3 days. He finally repentant and prayed to God and God heard his voice. The Fish spat him out on dry land and the word of God came to him again, this time he obeys it.
Isn‚Äôt it the case with us sometimes, that we just don‚Äôt want to do what God is asking? We run, hide and ignore God‚Äôs voice until we find ourselves in a mess that only God can take us out of.
He goes to Nineveh and preaches ‚Äú40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown‚Äù he does not give them any details ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt even tell them what wrong they are doing, or that it is the Lord Almighty the God of Israel that has sent him.
The people of Nineveh heed the warning and with the limited knowledge that they had ‚Äì they just go on a fast ‚Äì everyone ‚Äì starting with the King is fasting and praying. God is infinitely merciful and compassionate, He repented from the evil He was going to do and forgives them.
Now Jonah is furious because he knew that God is slow to anger and abounding in mercy and would forgive them their sin. Sometimes we don‚Äôt want to see others succeed in life, we are reluctant like Jonah. We want to keep God for us and not preach God‚Äôs mercy to the whole world. We are happy with our lifes and do not want to take the trouble or be uncomfortable for the sake of the Kingdom.
God appoints a plant to grow and it gives Jonah some shade, a worm destroyed the plant overnight and the plant died. This made Jonah angry again, and the Lord used this plant to help Jonah understand compassion. Jonah had compassion for a plant that he did not even plant, why should God not have compassion on the twenty thousand Ninevites who did not know thier left from their right. We usually underestimate God when it comes to compassion and mercy because we make God in our image and likeness instead of the other way around. We human beings are impatient and reluctant, angry, and do not have compassion like God. God is compassionate and merciful, far more than we can imagine. We look at sinners as gone cases, alcoholics, drug addicts, and sinful people as though they are non-redeemable. We may be the reason they are not being saved if we could just go out and preach God‚Äôs mercy to everyone ‚Äì the Lord will save them from their sin and save us from our pride.
Like the elder brother of the prodigal son, we may be hesitant to welcome back the sinner, the lost son who the father has already forgiven.
We may the vineyard workers who complain that those who were hired later in the day we're given the same wage.
Let us have some mercy and compassion for everyone in this world, let us be a little like God. He sees value in everyone no matter how bad they seem to us. Let us value everyone we meet, for Jesus lives in them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
