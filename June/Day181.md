### Day 181 Try not to be reluctant like Jonah because God‚Äôs mercy is never-ending

The word that stands out with prophet Jonah is reluctant, from starting to end. We all know the story of Jonah and the whale. He was called to go to Nineveh and preach repentance to them. But he fled the opposite way, he hopped on a ship to Tarshish. It‚Äôs not like he got the wrong ship, because the trip to Nineveh was a road trip approx. 550 miles on land, he jumped in a ship that was going 1500 miles in the other direction. He wanted to go as far away as possible from God‚Äôs calling. He is so reluctant that he wanted to run away even away from God‚Äôs presence. We know he learned that hard way ‚Äì in the stinky gut of the whale for 3 days. He finally repentant and prayed to God and God heard his voice. The Fish spat him out on dry land and the word of God came to him again, this time he obeys it.
Isn‚Äôt it the case with us sometimes, that we just don‚Äôt want to do what God is asking? We run, hide and ignore God‚Äôs voice until we find ourselves in a mess that only God can take us out of.
He goes to Nineveh and preaches ‚Äú40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown‚Äù he does not give them any details ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt even tell them what wrong they are doing, or that it is the Lord Almighty the God of Israel that has sent him.
The people of Nineveh heed the warning and with the limited knowledge that they had ‚Äì they just go on a fast ‚Äì everyone ‚Äì starting with the King is fasting and praying. God is infinitely merciful and compassionate, He repented from the evil He was going to do and forgives them.
Now Jonah is furious because he knew that God is slow to anger and abounding in mercy and would forgive them their sin. Sometimes we don‚Äôt want to see others succeed in life, we are reluctant like Jonah. We want to keep God for us and not preach God‚Äôs mercy to the whole world. We are happy with our lifes and do not want to take the trouble or be uncomfortable for the sake of the Kingdom.
God appoints a plant to grow and it gives Jonah some shade, a worm destroyed the plant overnight and the plant died. This made Jonah angry again, and the Lord used this plant to help Jonah understand compassion. Jonah had compassion for a plant that he did not even plant, why should God not have compassion on the twenty thousand Ninevites who did not know thier left from their right. We usually underestimate God when it comes to compassion and mercy because we make God in our image and likeness instead of the other way around. We human beings are impatient and reluctant, angry, and do not have compassion like God. God is compassionate and merciful, far more than we can imagine. We look at sinners as gone cases, alcoholics, drug addicts, and sinful people as though they are non-redeemable. We may be the reason they are not being saved if we could just go out and preach God‚Äôs mercy to everyone ‚Äì the Lord will save them from their sin and save us from our pride.
Like the elder brother of the prodigal son, we may be hesitant to welcome back the sinner, the lost son who the father has already forgiven.
We may the vineyard workers who complain that those who were hired later in the day we're given the same wage.
Let us have some mercy and compassion for everyone in this world, let us be a little like God. He sees value in everyone no matter how bad they seem to us. Let us value everyone we meet, for Jesus lives in them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 181 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 15:3-5

\*He (Azariah) did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.  Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.  Then the LORD afflicted the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he dwelt in a separate house.\*

Altars were built on very high places for worshipping idols.  These came to be known as ‚ÄúHigh Places.‚Äù
Like his father Amaziah (2 Kings 14:3-4), King Azariah also did what was right in God‚Äôs eyes, but not like his ancestor David; the ‚Äúhigh places were not taken away‚Ä¶‚Äù  People still continued worshipping idols instead of worshipping only the living God.  Both father and son were generally good, but their major flaw was in allowing idolatry to continue in the kingdom, thus violating the first Commandment.

There is no point in bringing people to Christ if we are comfortable when we see them still worshipping their false gods as before.
Bringing people to Christ means constantly reminding them and insisting that they detach themselves from their false gods (money, power, entertainment, etc.), when we know that the people are still clinging to them.

It is not enough for God‚Äôs people to be good citizens.  God‚Äôs people are required to be holy, which means they must surrender themselves completely to God‚Äôs Will.  But when they attend worship and spend a lot of time in Church, on one side, and focus more on power, money, status, entertainment, possessions and other worldly things, on the other side, then, like the people of Israel, they are worshipping God on one side and idols on the other side.

We cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24); therefore, if we are not 100 percent with God then we are with Satan.

God allowed the king to be afflicted with leprosy for the purpose of educating his people.  Leprosy was a symbol of sin.  This means, by worshipping idols the people were living with mortal sins.

In the new Covenant, if we focus too much on worldly matters instead of focusing on God‚Äôs Will, then we will eventually die with mortal sins, which means spiritual death or Hell.

Jonah 1:1-4
Jonah was reluctant to go to Ninevah (in Assyria) to give them God‚Äôs message, not because he was a coward, but because he knew exactly why God wanted Ninevah to repent.
Jonah was asked by God to give the good news of deliverance, to the enemy (Ninevah), so that his beloved country (Israel) could be destroyed by them because Israel was disobeying God totally and sinking deep in sin when they should have been holier than the rest of the world, a priestly nation, the future evangelists.

How many of us would have the courage to save our enemies knowing that our loved ones could be destroyed by them even if our loved ones were doing things against God‚Äôs Will?  It is no wonder that Jonah tried to escape.

Like the Israelites, we too are the people of God; a people who should be holier than the rest of the world, a priestly kingdom, the present and future evangelists.
Are we living our lives according to God‚Äôs Will, or are we too sinking in sin like the those Israelites?

When we oppose God's Will we will experience storms in our lives, and God allows that to happen to bring us back to Him.

When God has a special mission for us He will make sure His mission is accomplished through us so let us be obedient to God's call even if it is a difficult task or even if it is not matching our plans, or else we may have to suffer the consequences of our refusal.
When God has a mission for us He will ultimately take us on that path even if we try to run to the other side (Jonah 2:1 & 10).

Jonah was even willing to die (by drowning) so that God‚Äôs message would not be delivered to Ninevah, and that is why he didn‚Äôt tell the sailors to turn the boat and go back (Jonah 1:12).

Jonah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Jesus too loved us so much that He was willing to die to save us.

A great storm had hit the sea because Jonah had disobeyed God‚Äôs Word and yet Jonah was fast asleep (v. 1:5) instead of repenting and choosing to obey the Lord, while the sailors were terrified.

It could be that some people are going through misery and suffering because of our sins.  Let us not be comfortable in our nest just because the misery and suffering is not affecting us.  Whenever our enemies are going through suffering let us check if we have been the cause of their suffering. If we have, then let us correct our errors and repent.

Just as one man‚Äôs obedience can bring salvation to many souls, so also one man‚Äôs disobedience can bring destruction to many souls (Romans 5:19) and Jonah knew that his disobedience to God‚Äôs Word had brought this calamity upon the people around him.

Jonah 1:17
Jonah was not alive in the belly of the whale because he was speaking to God from Sheol.  That is why Jesus referred to Jonah‚Äôs case as a miracle (Matthew 12:39).

Jonah 3:4-10
Jonah had delivered his message only to one-third of Nineveh (v. 3) but the news spread to the rest of the city so fast that Jonah did not even have to worry about delivering his message to the rest of the city.   What a successful ministry!!!

Fasting and covering with sackcloth was a way of doing penance for sins, not only by the Israelites but, by most communities in the ancient world.
The Ninevites were pagans, not Jews, so they were not familiar with the God of Israel. Nevertheless, they reacted positively assuming that at least they had received a message from one of their gods.

Even though the Ninevites did not worship the God of Israel, God was pleased with them because of their genuine repentance and obedience to His Word.
If a non-Christian has not heard about Jesus but still worships the Creator and lives a righteous life, then he/she will definitely find favour with the Lord, just as Job (Job 1:8) and the Ninevites did.

Jonah 4:1
Jonah delivered God‚Äôs one-line message to the Ninevites, and the whole nation of one hundred twenty thousand people obeyed, repented and were saved.  The most successful ministry which every missionary would dream of.  But Jonah was angry at the success of his ministry, because he knew now that the destruction of Israel was definite.

Sometimes we too may feel like Jonah.  We may succeed in bringing our enemies to Christ but we may get angry and not like it when we see prosperity and blessings pouring on them, specially if they had brought great harm to our loved ones in the past or if we feel that it is likely they may go away from God and become a threat to our loved ones in the future.
