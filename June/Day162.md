### Day #162 Kings/Politicians use their power to lead people away from God.

We should always remember that Israelites were the ones who wanted a King. Earlier God was their King, leading them with fire and smoke and speaking to them through their leaders Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and Jacob. Even though God knew the Kings would eventually dominate the Israelites and misuse their power, He gave them what they asked for. We learned about King David, the high points and low points in his life. King Solomon the builder who built the beautiful temple, the wise man who stored up a lot of wealth. He misused his wisdom to impose high taxes on the people and made them work really hard as he used that money to build temples for his pagan wives' gods.
One would think that his son would be more sensitive to the people but turns out that Rehoboam did not take the counsel of the older/wiser men. Rehoboam listed to his friends ‚Äì or rather the ones who listen to him.
‚ÄúMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions‚Äù
Rehoboam is God‚Äôs anointed king yet so corrupt and evil, that the people literally drive him out of Israel(Northern) and he goes to the smaller part of Israel(Judah).
Now, remember every Jew had to go to the temple in Jerusalem to worship. Jeroboam(Solomon‚Äôs other son who came back from exile after his death) the king of the North did not want people going to the south to worship lest their hearts turn to God and they decide to follow the anointed king Rehoboam. So Jeroboam does the unthinkable ‚Äì he establishes his own religion ‚Äì he builds Golden calves for people to worship in the North. We can see how power has caused these Kings to reject God and his goodness.
In our more modern history, we have seen Kings going against the true church. King Henry VIII started the process of creating the Church of England after his split with the Pope in the 1530s. Henry was anxious to ensure a male heir after his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had borne him only a daughter. He wanted his marriage annulled in order to remarry. This boosted Protestantism and many wealthy people left the catholic church because they did not want to displease the king, the poor people were afraid of the fines put on them.
There are numerous examples in our history and present-day Politicians where God is rejected just so that those in power can get what they want. May we not be afraid but follow our conscious and do what is right in the sight of God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 162 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 12:12-17
The Davidic kings were shadows of the royal nature of Jesus and therefore they were supposed to be the loving bridegrooms of Israel (2 Samuel 5:1).  But, like an abusive bridegroom, Rehoboam refused to listen to the people's pains and oppressed his bride (Israel) more than before, and thus forced the 10 tribes of Israel to divorce him (separate themselves from him).

1 Kings 12:26-33
After the death of King Solomon, God left His people and thereafter the kingdom of Israel was split into two.  King Jeroboam ruled the northern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 10 tribes, whereas Solomon‚Äôs son King Rehoboam ruled the southern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 2 tribes.

Jeroboam was worried that if the people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple, as desired by God, then they may once again turn towards Rehoboam.  He was also afraid that the people may kill him to return to Rehoboam.  So he made two golden calves and he asked the people to worship the golden calves.  He built shrines in the northern kingdom as a cultic move against the Jerusalem Temple.  It was done to increase the economic structure of the northern kingdom by stopping the people from going to Jerusalem for the annual festivals (Passover, etc.).  Jeroboam also ordained non-Levitcal men as priests, which was not acceptable to God (1 Kings 13:33-34) because it was not the Mosaic ordination.

Jeroboam was earlier working under Solomon as the manager of forced labor.  God elevated Jeroboam from a king‚Äôs servant to be a king himself (1 Kings 11:26-39) and gave him a chance to lead the people and bring them closer to God, but Jeroboam, in his greed, took the people away from God.
Thus Jeroboam displeased the Lord.

If God has blessed us with a supervisory or leadership role, let us ensure that we please God in everything we say and do.  Let us also ensure that we guide our subordinates to do the same, whether we are parents, teachers, ministers, pastors, managers, directors, etc.
