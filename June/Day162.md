### Day #162 Kings/Politicians use their power to lead people away from God.

We should always remember that Israelites were the ones who wanted a King. Earlier God was their King, leading them with fire and smoke and speaking to them through their leaders Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and Jacob. Even though God knew the Kings would eventually dominate the Israelites and misuse their power, He gave them what they asked for. We learned about King David, the high points and low points in his life. King Solomon the builder who built the beautiful temple, the wise man who stored up a lot of wealth. He misused his wisdom to impose high taxes on the people and made them work really hard as he used that money to build temples for his pagan wives' gods.
One would think that his son would be more sensitive to the people but turns out that Rehoboam did not take the counsel of the older/wiser men. Rehoboam listed to his friends ‚Äì or rather the ones who listen to him.
‚ÄúMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions‚Äù
Rehoboam is God‚Äôs anointed king yet so corrupt and evil, that the people literally drive him out of Israel(Northern) and he goes to the smaller part of Israel(Judah).
Now, remember every Jew had to go to the temple in Jerusalem to worship. Jeroboam(Solomon‚Äôs other son who came back from exile after his death) the king of the North did not want people going to the south to worship lest their hearts turn to God and they decide to follow the anointed king Rehoboam. So Jeroboam does the unthinkable ‚Äì he establishes his own religion ‚Äì he builds Golden calves for people to worship in the North. We can see how power has caused these Kings to reject God and his goodness.
In our more modern history, we have seen Kings going against the true church. King Henry VIII started the process of creating the Church of England after his split with the Pope in the 1530s. Henry was anxious to ensure a male heir after his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had borne him only a daughter. He wanted his marriage annulled in order to remarry. This boosted Protestantism and many wealthy people left the catholic church because they did not want to displease the king, the poor people were afraid of the fines put on them.
There are numerous examples in our history and present-day Politicians where God is rejected just so that those in power can get what they want. May we not be afraid but follow our conscious and do what is right in the sight of God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
