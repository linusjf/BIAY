### Day #165 “My sister, my bride”

These words from the book of Song of Solomon may seem odd
A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed. SOS 4:12
The Bridegroom is referring to the bride as my sister, my bride which can be seen as weird. However, the deeper meaning can be understood by the Greek definition of the word love. Greek words for love are Agape, Eros, Philia, and Storge.
Agape is the unconditional love of God for His children.
Eros means romantic or intimate love.
Philia is affectionate friendship
Storge is affectionate love for children or parents.
In a good marriage, it is important to have Philia love as Eros will not last a lifetime. A couple should have an affectionate friendship(Philia) so they can spend a good life together. The phrase “I married my best friend” is well-fitting in this context. If there is a lack of friendship between a husband and wife, married life becomes a drag. Philia love lasts a lifetime and grows as the years go by. However Eros love on its own can seem to diminish over the years, but if the Philla love is kept active, Eros love grows as well.
Eros love separated from Philla can becomes selfish and affect the marriage in a negative way. The Bridegroom is not supposed to take his wife for granted, as described in SOS -she is a "locked garden". One should approach Eros love as a request and in openness, seeking and not demanding. Just like in the next chapter we read “My beloved is knocking” – one is called to be a gentleman/woman – approach Eros love as though it’s a gift.
Jesus our bridegroom – approaches us with the same gentleness. Jesus does not push and force His way into our lives. In the Book of Revelation, we read about Him knocking at the door of our hearts.
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. Rev 3:20
Jesus could have easily said – “I am your creator, better listen to me” or “I died for you, stop sinning and let me eat dinner” or “where is the fruit? May this tree be destroyed” But he didn't.
Jesus approaches us with gentleness, “Here I am” “I stand” “I knock” – “if anyone hears my voice” “if you open the door” – just picture this the savior of the world, standing and knocking – waiting for our response. Let us not delay in opening our hearts, to welcome the Love of lives Jesus into every aspect of our lives into the Philla and Eros of our marriages. It takes 3 to get married – husband, wife, and God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
