### Day #156 "Prayer of faith brings healing" , “Do not fear just believe.”

We read this moving story of Jairus and his daughter. The scene opens with a desperate father - Jairus who fell at Jesus' feet begging for the healing of his daughter. While Jesus was on the way to go heal the girl, there was a big crowd around Jesus – many people were touching and pushing Jesus. However, one woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for many years and had spent all that she had but suffered at the hands of the physicians instead of getting healed. According to the customs, she should not touch anyone if not they would become unclean, however, her faith went beyond her reason and she reached out and touched Jesus’ cloak, and immediately after she got healed of her hemorrhage. Jesus stopped and said “Who touched me?” for power went out of Him.
Even though there were many people who were pushing Jesus and touching Him, only the one who touched Him in faith received the healing. Even today when we pray, we sometimes do not have faith, we are just listing out our problems without believing that Jesus can heal us or provide for us -those prayers without faith are just like the crowd that was pushing Jesus, like the crowd that only followed Jesus because their belly was filled with the feeding of the multitude. We ought to make prayers of “faith” believing in our hearts that Jesus will answer them, these prayers of faith touch Jesus.
Never lose hope even if the situation gets worse like that of Jairus, whose daughter died while Jesus was on the way. Jesus encouraged Jairus and said, “Do not fear, only believe”. Jesus entered the house, cleared the place of those mourning, and brought the girl back to life.
So be it with our life, even if it seems that God is not answering our prayers of faith do not give us. Jesus encourages us as he encouraged Jairus “Do not fear, only believe”. Let us not be afraid of anything, even if it seems that all is lost, just trust in Him and have faith. Because Jesus is walking towards us, He is coming to take care of us. “Do not fear just believe.”
Every time we are afraid just say these words Jesus taught Jairus.
“Do not fear just believe.”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Mark 5:4
\*For he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.\*

Inspite of being tied with shackles and chains the man was able to break himself free.

Sometimes we think we are smarter than the evil one and we can fool him easily but we have to remember that the evil one is the most intelligent creature of God’s creation.  More often, than not, with his modern ideologies the evil one makes us walk on his path willingly, with no resistance from us at all. Without the presence of God in our lives we can be easily deceived into thinking that we are walking on the right path.  Whatever we do to get rid of the devil, he will always find a new way to trick us.  But God will be present in our lives only if we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, regularly, and keep our souls purified at all times.

Mark 5:18-20
\*As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  But Jesus refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.”\*
\*And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.\*

The man wanted to be a disciple of Jesus but Jesus made him a missionary.  After the demons were cast out of the man, and without any experience, he did such a great job of making Jesus known to the people that when Jesus came to that same place the second time there was a huge crowd of gentiles waiting to hear Him preach.

If we keep ourselves purified at all times the Lord will bless us and help us to be little missionaries like that man. We don't need to be scholars or experienced people to do God's work.

Mark 5:21-43
Jairus’s daughter was twelve years old, while the woman had been suffering from haemorrhage for the same length of time (12 years).

At the same moment when Jesus said to the woman, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace” Jairus got news from his home that his daughter had died.  When one daughter was healed, the other one died.

Jairus may have been a synagogue official in that same area where the woman lived.
This is the one and only time Jesus addresses a woman as “daughter.”

Why here? And why now?

Probably, in order to call Jairus’s attention to the fact that he was not the only person there who had a daughter in need of healing.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

If this was indeed the case, we can wonder whether Jairus ever thought about this woman, whether he noticed that she was missing or remembered that she was excluded from God’s house. Perhaps he did not even give her a second thought all these years. But now, at the moment when his daughter lay desperately ill, when time was of the essence to heal her, this same woman delayed Jesus from coming to Jairus's home.
And it is certain that Jairus noticed her when he was with Jesus.

What could have been going on in Jairus’s heart at that moment?
Was he angry at her for delaying Jesus?
Did he want her to just go away?

All those thoughts would have come crashing down in the moment when he heard Jesus call her his “daughter”, and then in the next moment to hear his servant say: “Do not trouble the master: your daughter is dead.”

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God’s daughter for 12 years.

If we are God’s children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members (Christians) during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during Mass.

Mark 6:31
\*People were coming and going in great numbers, so that Jesus and His Apostles had no opportunity even to eat.  So Jesus said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.”\*

Jesus wanted the disciples to rest physically so that they could reflect spiritually on their mission.  He wanted them to guard themselves against burnout.
God wants us to work for six days and rest on the seventh day because the seventh day must be dedicated to spending time with God, and Satan uses fatigue to separate us from God and our families.  Fatigue causes irritation which leads to anger and thus disturbs the peace and happiness around us.

When the devil can’t make us bad, he makes us busy, because God does not speak to us when our bodies and minds are busy.  God speaks to us (through our thoughts) only when our bodies are relaxed, our minds are at peace and there’s silence around.

### DAY 156: By Sheila

In today's Study, Jesus reached out to the Gentiles even in seemingly hopeless situations. Healing demon possessed cases of powerful evil forces, apparently of fallen angels who are part of Satan's rebellious ones. They work in the arena of the mind, causing people to believe lies and  embrace worldly wisdom.

Jesus always commanded them to depart. The void left in the person's life was to be filled by New Life, the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to walk in the Holy Spirit fullness.

The bleeding unclean woman, when she touched Jesus, He made her clean. All who came to Him had seen the miracles and heard life-changing teachings.

Many heard the circumstances surrounding His Birth and rejected Him, His hometown as well. Jesus equipped those who believed Him and sent them to do the work of the Kingdom.

John the Baptist refused to cover the adultery of Herod Antipas and Herodias. John was finally beheaded and put to death. The family was ruthless. He even stole his brother Philip's wife.

The feeding of 5,000 that Jesus performed was to verify that the Kingdom was being offered, provision for feasts, A training for His Disciples, A mission to feed the hungry with the little they had.

JESUS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD would supply all needs.

The Psalm is a thanksgiving for God's Blessings. The God who has brought Victories to His People ALWAYS, in the past, could be trusted to grant our future victories too.
