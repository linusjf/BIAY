### Day #156 "Prayer of faith brings healing" , “Do not fear just believe.”

We read this moving story of Jairus and his daughter. The scene opens with a desperate father - Jairus who fell at Jesus' feet begging for the healing of his daughter. While Jesus was on the way to go heal the girl, there was a big crowd around Jesus – many people were touching and pushing Jesus. However, one woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for many years and had spent all that she had but suffered at the hands of the physicians instead of getting healed. According to the customs, she should not touch anyone if not they would become unclean, however, her faith went beyond her reason and she reached out and touched Jesus’ cloak, and immediately after she got healed of her hemorrhage. Jesus stopped and said “Who touched me?” for power went out of Him.
Even though there were many people who were pushing Jesus and touching Him, only the one who touched Him in faith received the healing. Even today when we pray, we sometimes do not have faith, we are just listing out our problems without believing that Jesus can heal us or provide for us -those prayers without faith are just like the crowd that was pushing Jesus, like the crowd that only followed Jesus because their belly was filled with the feeding of the multitude. We ought to make prayers of “faith” believing in our hearts that Jesus will answer them, these prayers of faith touch Jesus.
Never lose hope even if the situation gets worse like that of Jairus, whose daughter died while Jesus was on the way. Jesus encouraged Jairus and said, “Do not fear, only believe”. Jesus entered the house, cleared the place of those mourning, and brought the girl back to life.
So be it with our life, even if it seems that God is not answering our prayers of faith do not give us. Jesus encourages us as he encouraged Jairus “Do not fear, only believe”. Let us not be afraid of anything, even if it seems that all is lost, just trust in Him and have faith. Because Jesus is walking towards us, He is coming to take care of us. “Do not fear just believe.”
Every time we are afraid just say these words Jesus taught Jairus.
“Do not fear just believe.”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
