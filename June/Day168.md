### BIAY Day 168 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 21:1-29
Buying and selling of property in Israel was not allowed because the land which the people had received was a gift from God, and yet, King Ahab wanted to buy Naboth’s vineyard.  Naboth however refused to sell it because he was a righteous man, who faithfully followed the laws of God.  Therefore Ahab, upon advice from his wife, arranged for Naboth to be stoned to death.

In this passage we see injustice done to Naboth but the culprit (Ahab) was spared because he repented.

Why does God allow the innocent ones to die cruel deaths at the hands of wicked people?
This has been a very common question since thousands of years.
But before we start being judgemental about God’s justice, we must first ask ourselves, “whose sins caused Jesus, the innocent and sinless son of God, to be scourged and crucified?”

In a covenantal relation it is always the innocent ones who have to pay the price for the sins of the wicked ones, because the death of an innocent person brings about a transformation in the life of a wicked person, as in the case of Ahab.  God may not always send official prophets and priests to transform the wicked, like He did with Ahab.  He may just stir up their conscience to bring about the change.
God’s grace flows when an innocent man dies in peace at the hands of the wicked (as in the case of Naboth) or when the innocent man forgives his offenders before dying (as in the case of Stephen / Acts 7:59-60).

If we are baptized in Christ, then we must be prepared to suffer and die like Christ to bring about a change in someone, and God may use us to bring about that change.
God’s justice against the wicked will be satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous.  If God is just, He is also merciful.  God in His justice said the price for our sins has to be paid, but God in His mercy said He would pay the price because each one of us is precious to Him.

God’s Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). When we are baptized we become missionaries and soldiers of Christ.  We are sent into this world for a short period of time, to carry out our mission and return back to our kingdom.  Our duty is to stand on the spiritual battlefield every day of our lives and fight the evil forces, represented by humans, while we carry out God’s mission on earth, whatever we may have been called to do for the growth of God’s Kingdom

As soldiers of Christ we must always remember that a battlefield is not a comfort zone.  Therefore we must be prepared to face attacks from the evil ones.  It may be in the form of insults, humiliation, criticism, rejection, false accusations, injustice, any kind of suffering or even giving up our lives, etc., but, like Naboth, we must always be obedient to God’s commandments to the end.

When Satan comes with his deceptive offers of comfort and pleasure and twists our minds, we often tend to forget our true mission and we start building our nests on earth, and then, when we face negative situations, we are clueless about why things are happening the way they are and how to respond according to God’s Will.

We therefore need to start questioning ourselves:

Have we started the mission which we were sent here for?
Are we even aware of what our mission is?
Did we ask God to help us find our mission?

In this passage, Naboth was a shadow of Jesus, and Ahab was a shadow of us sinners.  Naboth was also a shadow of the innocent people of God who die at the hands of the wicked, and Ahab was a shadow of the wicked people.
God allows this to happen so that one or more lost souls can be brought into His kingdom.
If we look at Naboth’s case from the worldly point of view, we see injustice done to him.  But if we look at his case from God’s point of view, then we see God’s victory through Naboth (1 Kings 21:29).

We will all die according to the expiry date which God has set for us.  It is not important for us to focus on living a long life and, however much we try we cannot increase our life span even if we go to the gym every day and eat healthy food.
What is more important is whether we have been successful in bringing souls to the Kingdom of God during our lifetime, not by force but by doing God’s Will.  And if our death can bring at least one soul to God, then our life is worth living (James 5:20).

### Day #168 The Sin of Omission

The sin of omission is failure to perform an action or a duty.
We read about King Ahab who wanted to buy Naboth’s vineyard – which Naboth did not want to sell, rather could not sell as per the Jewish law. No one owned property but were only tenant’s and the property belonged to the family.
Ahab was being a baby about not getting the vineyard and refused to eat. His wife Jezebel took matters into her own hands and sent out letters in the Kings name. She sent out letters to elders and noble men from Naboth’s town to bring false charges against Naboth and have him killed.
The sin of omission that they committed was this “So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. ”
They should have not accepted to lie and bear false witness against Naboth. Their failure to act justly, would eventually cost Naboth his life. This even caused God’s just judgment on Ahab, his family, and everyone under him.
In the same way, we should not be silent when something wrong ihappens in front of us. We cannot look the other way and expect things to be okay. We need to say something if we see something. The silence of good men is worse than the bad deeds of evil men. This quote has become rather famous now.
“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,”
We are called to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
13 “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
14 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Mat 5:13-16
We have to let our light shine in the dark places of the earth. We cannot let sin and evil prevail on earth and do nothing about it. For example, we cannot be quiet when unborn babies are legally being aborted with taxpayers money or let children be sexually abused by grown-ups. We cannot be silent, this is the sin of omission. We need to speak the truth in love and with a lot of care. We also commit the sin of omission when we fail to proclaim the Gospel, we we fail to love our neighbour in need.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 169 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 22:7-8

\*But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no other prophet of the LORD here whom we might consult ?”  The king of Israel answered, “There is one other man through whom we might consult the LORD; but I hate him because he never prophesies anything favourable about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah, son of Imlah.”\*

The king of Israel, chose to turn to false prophets because they always prophesied what he wanted to hear.  He always avoided Micaiah who was a man of God because the king was not obeying God’s commandments and therefore Micaiah never prophesied anything pleasing to the king.

Many of us are like the king of Israel.  We don’t like to obey God’s commandments and then we get angry with or try to avoid people who correct us when we are wrong, instead of taking it as a message from God and trying to change ourselves.  We also try to avoid going to Church because we are constantly reminded to change our sinful way of life.  We prefer to move around with and follow people who say things that are pleasing to our ears.  Thus, like the king of Israel, we allow our pride to lead us on the road to Hell by listening to and following the wrong people.

This attitude of God’s people in the new Covenant, was prophesied 2,000 years ago (2 Timothy 4:3-4).
