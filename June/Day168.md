### BIAY Day 168 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 21:1-29
Buying and selling of property in Israel was not allowed because the land which the people had received was a gift from God, and yet, King Ahab wanted to buy Naboth‚Äôs vineyard.  Naboth however refused to sell it because he was a righteous man, who faithfully followed the laws of God.  Therefore Ahab, upon advice from his wife, arranged for Naboth to be stoned to death.

In this passage we see injustice done to Naboth but the culprit (Ahab) was spared because he repented.

Why does God allow the innocent ones to die cruel deaths at the hands of wicked people?
This has been a very common question since thousands of years.
But before we start being judgemental about God‚Äôs justice, we must first ask ourselves, ‚Äúwhose sins caused Jesus, the innocent and sinless son of God, to be scourged and crucified?‚Äù

In a covenantal relation it is always the innocent ones who have to pay the price for the sins of the wicked ones, because the death of an innocent person brings about a transformation in the life of a wicked person, as in the case of Ahab.  God may not always send official prophets and priests to transform the wicked, like He did with Ahab.  He may just stir up their conscience to bring about the change.
God‚Äôs grace flows when an innocent man dies in peace at the hands of the wicked (as in the case of Naboth) or when the innocent man forgives his offenders before dying (as in the case of Stephen / Acts 7:59-60).

If we are baptized in Christ, then we must be prepared to suffer and die like Christ to bring about a change in someone, and God may use us to bring about that change.
God‚Äôs justice against the wicked will be satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous.  If God is just, He is also merciful.  God in His justice said the price for our sins has to be paid, but God in His mercy said He would pay the price because each one of us is precious to Him.

God‚Äôs Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). When we are baptized we become missionaries and soldiers of Christ.  We are sent into this world for a short period of time, to carry out our mission and return back to our kingdom.  Our duty is to stand on the spiritual battlefield every day of our lives and fight the evil forces, represented by humans, while we carry out God‚Äôs mission on earth, whatever we may have been called to do for the growth of God‚Äôs Kingdom

As soldiers of Christ we must always remember that a battlefield is not a comfort zone.  Therefore we must be prepared to face attacks from the evil ones.  It may be in the form of insults, humiliation, criticism, rejection, false accusations, injustice, any kind of suffering or even giving up our lives, etc., but, like Naboth, we must always be obedient to God‚Äôs commandments to the end.

When Satan comes with his deceptive offers of comfort and pleasure and twists our minds, we often tend to forget our true mission and we start building our nests on earth, and then, when we face negative situations, we are clueless about why things are happening the way they are and how to respond according to God‚Äôs Will.

We therefore need to start questioning ourselves:

Have we started the mission which we were sent here for?
Are we even aware of what our mission is?
Did we ask God to help us find our mission?

In this passage, Naboth was a shadow of Jesus, and Ahab was a shadow of us sinners.  Naboth was also a shadow of the innocent people of God who die at the hands of the wicked, and Ahab was a shadow of the wicked people.
God allows this to happen so that one or more lost souls can be brought into His kingdom.
If we look at Naboth‚Äôs case from the worldly point of view, we see injustice done to him.  But if we look at his case from God‚Äôs point of view, then we see God‚Äôs victory through Naboth (1 Kings 21:29).

We will all die according to the expiry date which God has set for us.  It is not important for us to focus on living a long life and, however much we try we cannot increase our life span even if we go to the gym every day and eat healthy food.
What is more important is whether we have been successful in bringing souls to the Kingdom of God during our lifetime, not by force but by doing God‚Äôs Will.  And if our death can bring at least one soul to God, then our life is worth living (James 5:20).
