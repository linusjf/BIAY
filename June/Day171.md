### Day #171 A double portion of the Spirit

If we recall, Elijah threw his cloak on Elisha and made him his disciple. Elijah was Elisha’s mentor and guide. It was time for Elijah to go up to the Lord, literally go up. He is the second person recorded in scripture who did not die. (Do you know who is the first person? Enoch – who walked and walked until the Lord took him up) Elisha did not want to let go of Elijah, Elijah asked him to tarry many times but Elisha just didn’t listen.
Finally, Elijah asked Elisha “Ask what I shall do from you before I am taken from you”
And Elisha said, “I beg you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit.” 1 Kings 2:9
Usually, the eldest son inherited a double share of his father’s property, since Elijah was his spiritual son and hence wants a double portion of the spirit. Elijah recognized that this was something that is not his own, but the Lord’s gift, that is why he said ‘if you see me taken up then you have the double spirit’. Our God is more generous than we can imagine, he gave Elisha his request. Elisha saw Elijah going up by a whirlwind. Elisha called out to his spiritual father “My father, my father”. Then Elisha took Elijah’s cloak that was fallen – possibly the same cloak that Elijah put on Elisha when we called him. Elisha now has a double portion of the spirit, he performs miracles like Elijah(parting the water) and more amazing stuff coming up.
The thing to learn from Elisha is that – we should not sell ourselves short. We are children of God and can do anything. We sometimes become timid with spiritual asks and just ask for small things. We should be bold and expect more from God. Our God is willing and will bless us far more than we can imagine. Just try being bold and ask in faith. Jesus will bless us with the good things we need to extend the Kingdom of God. Ask for the gifts of the Spirit, healing, deliverance, for the gift of knowledge, and wisdom.
Be bold Be brave and ask for a double portion by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
