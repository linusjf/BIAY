### Day #161 My God my God why have you forsaken me

The most difficult part of Jesus’ suffering would have been the separation from the Father and the Spirit. When Jesus took our sin upon Himself, he would have felt all the guilt that every human has ever felt. When we sin, we feel separated from God as though God is far away or angry with us. When Jesus took on the cup of suffering our sin, He suffered and died for us. Sin cost the very life of God. The Holy Trinity is so united in love that the pain caused to the Father and the Spirit to see the Son suffer is unthinkable. Although Jesus wasn’t abandoned by God, He probably felt what we human beings feel when we commit sin. The effects of sin are terrible, and we can see it manifest in the cross, where the purest one suffered for us all.
The other reason Mark used this verse was the point to Psalm 22 where we see the suffering of David(or any human being for that matter). Also, the Psalm is fulfilled in Jesus' passion “I am a worm and no man scorned by men and despised by the people”, “I am poured out like water” “my heart is like wax” and “they pierced my hands and my feet”.
Suffering is part of life, and no one can avoid it. Suffering is in fact the way to the cross, to salvation. We are called to embrace suffering and not flee from it, pick up our cross and follow Him daily. We may feel abandoned or feel that God is not answering our prayers. However remember as Jesus rose from the dead, we will also rise above our suffering if we accept it. We may feel like running away from our sufferings and even pray like Jesus “May this cup pass from me”, but the only way forward is to accept our crosses. He will not let us be tested beyond our capacity, remember that Jesus is with us even though we may feel that we have been abandoned.
“ And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Mat 28:20
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
