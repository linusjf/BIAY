### Day #173 Elisha‚Äôs double portion ‚Äì double Miracles

We remember that Elisha asked for a double portion of the spirit of Elijah and the Lord granted it. Was doing an internet look up and there was a compiled list of the Miracles done by the two prophets. Interestingly Elijah performed 8 while Elisha performed 16. At least these were the ones recorded in scripture.

ELIJAH'S 8 MIRACLES:

1. Shut up the heavens causing a drought (1 Kng 17:1)

2. Multiplied flour and oil for a widow (1 Kng 17:14-16)

3. Raised a widow's son from the dead (1 Kng 17:17, 22-23)

4. Defeated the prophets of Baal with fire from heaven (1 Kng 18:25-38)

5. Brought rain to end the drought (1 Kng 18:41-45)

6. Destroyed 51 soldiers with fire (2 Kng 1:9-10)

7. Destroyed second batch of 51 soldiers with fire and lightening (2 Kng 1:9-11-12)

8. Parted the waters of the Jordan River (2 Kng 2:8)

ELISHA'S 16 MIRACLES:

01. Parted the waters of the Jordan River (2 Kng 2:14)

02. Purification of the water source for Jericho (2 Kng 2:18-22)

03. Protection of the prophet by two she-bears (2 Kng 2:23-25)

04. Water for the army of Israel and success over the Moabites (2 Kng 3:16-25)

05. Providing the widow's oil (2 Kng 4:1-7)

06. Elisha's annunciation prophecy for the woman from Shunem (2 Kng 4:8-17)

07. Resurrection of the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kng 4:18-37)

08. Purified the poison soup (2 Kng 4:38-41)

09. Multiplication of loaves (2 Kng 4:42-44)

10. Healing of Naaman (2 Kng 5:1-19)

11. Gehazi cursed with a skin disease (2 Kng 5:25-27)

12. Miracle of finding the axe (2 Kng 6:1-7)

13. Capturing a band of Aramaeans by striking them blind (2 Kng 6:8-23)

14. Prophesizing relief from the enemy and the famine (2 Kng 6:24-7:20)

15. Prophesizing the death of Ben-Hadad and the rise of Hazael (2 Kng 8:7-15)

16. Prophesizing that Israel's defeat of King Hazael of Damascus (2 Kng 13:14-19)

Of all the Miracles one of the important ones is the feeding of the 100.

42 A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing food from the first fruits to the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, ‚ÄúGive it to the people and let them eat.‚Äù 43 But his servant said, ‚ÄúHow can I set this before a hundred people?‚Äù So he repeated, ‚ÄúGive it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the Lord: They shall eat and have some left.‚Äù 44 He set it before them; they ate and had some left, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 4:42

This prefigures the feeding of the 5000 by Jesus and the feeding of the 5000 prefigures the Last Supper, where Jesus offers bread and wine, his own body, and blood. After Jesus' death on the cross where he offers himself to the world so that we can be saved. We now have the Eucharist where Jesus feeds the whole world. Beautiful prefiguration, starting from Moses feeding the people in the desert, - Mana from heaven, to the Miracle of Elisha ‚Äì feeding of the 100, Jesus' feeding of the 5000, and finally the Eucharist ‚Äì food for the world. Let us participate in this great Miracle of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are transformed into Jesus‚Äôs body and blood.

"Eucharist food for the world"

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 173: By Sheila

In the Book of Kings, The Resurrection of the Shunammite's son parallels Elijah's Resurrection of the Widow's Son. This miracle established Elisha as Elijah's True Successor.
In Chronicles Ahaz associated with Judah's most disgusting pagan practices. Ahaz was finally defeated by Israel and Syria but did not learn from his mistakes. Ahaz brought Judah to the lowest point.
In Psalm God gives genuine rest to those who depend on HIM. All human effort is worthless without the Blessings of the Lord.
