### Day #157 Jesus is the Good Shepherd described in Psalm 23

As we read Psalm 23 through the lens of the New Testament. We see Jesus as the fulfillment of the promise of the Good Shepherd. There is an explicit comparison in John 10 where Jesus is proclaimed the “Good Shepherd”. Let us go through this beautiful psalm 23 verse by verse.
“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures;”
We see that Jesus meets our biggest need, our need for redemption. We needed forgiveness of sins and needed a savior. That is when Jesus the good shepherd laid down his life to save us. We now can lie down in the green pastures of heaven, there are no tears or pain or suffering in heaven – we will be full with the presence of the Lord.
Jesus will supply all our needs on earth as well – whenever Jesus encountered anyone during His earthly life – they never went back empty-handed – they received healing, teaching, deliverance, and physical food as well. Jesus supplied all their needs and will supply all our needs as well. We shall not be in want.
“he leads me beside still waters;”
We read in the Gospels that Jesus was able to still the raging storms and even walk on water and encourages Peter to walk on the water. Jesus knows that our lives are filled with worries and burdens, hence he invites us “Come to me and I will give you rest” – He will lead us through still waters and give us rest.
“he restores my soul.”
Jesus came to restore the relationship of man with God. He restores our souls to the father. Whenever Jesus healed anyone – he also made them whole, forgave them their sins, and said do it no more. He is restoring everyone’s soul to the state of no sin.
“He leads me in right paths for his name’s sake.”
As a good shepherd he calls us by name, His own hear his voice and follow Him. We are his sheep and He is our good shepherd. He not only leads us on the right path but is the right path. “He is the gate and the way”.
“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me;”
Even if we lose our way, Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes looking for the 1 lost sheep. Once found He binds our wounds and restores us back to the flock. We need not fear for Jesus promised us that He is with us till the end of ages. Even if we go through tough times we should not fear “Fear Not, only believe”
your rod and your staff— they comfort me.
Jesus comforts us from the Cross, He pleads for us and asks the Father to forgive us our sins. Jesus suffers for us on the Cross and gives us the courage and suffers with us when we go through tough times on earth. The wooden staff can be compared to the cross and the rod can be compared to the sphere that pierced his side, blood and water poured out to the whole world, forgiving us.
“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;”
This good shepherd at the last supper instituted the Eucharist. He asks us to remember him at the table of the altar. He said – “do this in memory of me.”
you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Our cup will never run dry as Jesus does not give us earthy water but the living water, the Holy Spirit that whelms up within our hearts. We are anointed by the Holy Spirit with a font that is ever-flowing, never-ending.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
Jesus’s Mercy and goodness are ever-present to us. He never rejects us no matter how bad our sin is, we are always welcome to approach the Mercy seat of Jesus, for he knows our weakness and is able to sympathize with us.
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.
One thing that we can be sure of is Jesus’ presence in our lives. He is Emmanuel – God with us. Rather than us going up to the temple in Jerusalem, Jesus comes to us at every Church in the form of the Holy Eucharist. He is always present to us, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts. If anyone lets me in, I will come in and dine with them.
May we love Jesus our Good shepherd and welcome Him into every part of our lives.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
