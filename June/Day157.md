### Day #157 Jesus is the Good Shepherd described in Psalm 23

As we read Psalm 23 through the lens of the New Testament. We see Jesus as the fulfillment of the promise of the Good Shepherd. There is an explicit comparison in John 10 where Jesus is proclaimed the “Good Shepherd”. Let us go through this beautiful psalm 23 verse by verse.
“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures;”
We see that Jesus meets our biggest need, our need for redemption. We needed forgiveness of sins and needed a savior. That is when Jesus the good shepherd laid down his life to save us. We now can lie down in the green pastures of heaven, there are no tears or pain or suffering in heaven – we will be full with the presence of the Lord.
Jesus will supply all our needs on earth as well – whenever Jesus encountered anyone during His earthly life – they never went back empty-handed – they received healing, teaching, deliverance, and physical food as well. Jesus supplied all their needs and will supply all our needs as well. We shall not be in want.
“he leads me beside still waters;”
We read in the Gospels that Jesus was able to still the raging storms and even walk on water and encourages Peter to walk on the water. Jesus knows that our lives are filled with worries and burdens, hence he invites us “Come to me and I will give you rest” – He will lead us through still waters and give us rest.
“he restores my soul.”
Jesus came to restore the relationship of man with God. He restores our souls to the father. Whenever Jesus healed anyone – he also made them whole, forgave them their sins, and said do it no more. He is restoring everyone’s soul to the state of no sin.
“He leads me in right paths for his name’s sake.”
As a good shepherd he calls us by name, His own hear his voice and follow Him. We are his sheep and He is our good shepherd. He not only leads us on the right path but is the right path. “He is the gate and the way”.
“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me;”
Even if we lose our way, Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes looking for the 1 lost sheep. Once found He binds our wounds and restores us back to the flock. We need not fear for Jesus promised us that He is with us till the end of ages. Even if we go through tough times we should not fear “Fear Not, only believe”
your rod and your staff— they comfort me.
Jesus comforts us from the Cross, He pleads for us and asks the Father to forgive us our sins. Jesus suffers for us on the Cross and gives us the courage and suffers with us when we go through tough times on earth. The wooden staff can be compared to the cross and the rod can be compared to the sphere that pierced his side, blood and water poured out to the whole world, forgiving us.
“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;”
This good shepherd at the last supper instituted the Eucharist. He asks us to remember him at the table of the altar. He said – “do this in memory of me.”
you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Our cup will never run dry as Jesus does not give us earthy water but the living water, the Holy Spirit that whelms up within our hearts. We are anointed by the Holy Spirit with a font that is ever-flowing, never-ending.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
Jesus’s Mercy and goodness are ever-present to us. He never rejects us no matter how bad our sin is, we are always welcome to approach the Mercy seat of Jesus, for he knows our weakness and is able to sympathize with us.
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.
One thing that we can be sure of is Jesus’ presence in our lives. He is Emmanuel – God with us. Rather than us going up to the temple in Jerusalem, Jesus comes to us at every Church in the form of the Holy Eucharist. He is always present to us, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts. If anyone lets me in, I will come in and dine with them.
May we love Jesus our Good shepherd and welcome Him into every part of our lives.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 157 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Mark 7:1–13
*And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?”*

Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous human traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined God’s truths. He instructed his followers to abide by the traditions that are not contrary to God’s commandments.  And, as the Apostles taught (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15), the rest are to be obeyed.

Mark 7:24-30
\*She came and bowed down at his feet.\*

By bowing down at His feet / kneeling before Him, the gentile woman was acknowledging the divinity of Jesus.
Jesus first ignored the lady but she persisted in her request.  Inspite of being a Canaanite she worshipped him by calling him “Lord.”

She humbled herself in front of a Jew.  She was desperate because her child was being tormented by a demon and she knew the situation was out of her control.

When our children go far away from God it is best to place our children in God's hands because we cannot fight demons, only God can.  Meanwhile, we must continue making efforts to improve our own spiritual life while we also pray for our children. If we use our human efforts to solve the problem it can turn into a disaster.

\*Jesus said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”\*

The Israelites are the children of God (Exodus 4:22-23; Deut. 14:1; Isaiah 1:2).
Jesus compared the woman to a dog because He wanted to bring out her faith.
It may sound like Jesus was being rude to the woman, but that is exactly how it feels when our faith is being tested.

When Jesus compared the woman to a dog, she had two options :

1. she could allow her pride to control her, take the response of Jesus as an insult and leave Jesus, OR,

2. she could humble herself and accept that she was not the greatest.

If she chose Option 1, then, because of her pride, her daughter would have to live with the demon all her life.
But the Cannanite woman made a wise choice.  She chose Option 2, and Jesus healed the child because of the faith, humility and persistent prayer of the mother.

The tests, for our faith in Christ, don’t come on a bed of roses. They are usually rocks and thorns which come in the form of rejections, insults, criticisms, humiliation, false accusations, etc.
If we look at them positively then our humility will help us to see God working through them to heal us spiritually.  But if we look at them negatively then our pride will only show us how we have been demoralized, disrespected, hurt, etc.  In other words, our pride will show us that we are the god who was not given importance.

The Canaanite woman, however, did not look at the response of Jesus as negative or rude. In her humility she accepted her comparison to a dog and replied appropriately.

Let us learn from the Cannanite woman to humble ourselves and choose our words wisely when we communicate with others.

\*But she answered him, “Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”\*

It is, and always has been, an insult for anyone to be compared to a dog (Philippians 3:2; Revelation 22:15).
These words of the gentile woman being accepted by Jesus was an assurance for the first century gentiles that the Bread of salvation was available, not only for the Jews, but, also for the gentiles.

Crumbs are left-overs.
The children are the people of God whom Jesus came to feed with the heavenly bread, but if the Jews don't want the Bread of Life then the gentiles will starve because there won’t be any crumbs.

Similarly, if Christians don’t live in a state of grace then the Bread of Life which they eat is no good (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) therefore the non-Christians will suffer because Jesus will not save the world through Christians whose light does not shine.

\*Then he said to her, “For saying this, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”\*

Sometimes when we feel that our children have spiritually declined or gone far away from God, let us remember that the Cannanite woman’s daughter was freed from the demon because of her mother’s faith, humility and persistent prayer, and, like the Cannanite woman, let us pray persistently for our fallen away children.
Like the despised Cannanite woman, however sinful we parents may be, God will surely answer our prayers and spiritually heal the souls of our fallen away children, if we make an attempt to increase our own faith in God and be humble always.

Mark 7:33
\*He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.\*

Jesus could have just said the word and the man would have been healed, but He chose to use a sacramental procedure to perform this miracle.

A sacrament is an outward sign of an inward grace.
Jesus used His saliva and fingers for grace to flow into the man. The man could have felt disgusted and backed away but it was his humility that made him accept the method which Jesus was using.

By performing this miracle sacramentally, Jesus was also preparing His Apostles for the Last Supper where He was going to offer His Sacramental Body and Blood in atonement for our sins, so that they would understand how God's grace flows into humans through materials when they would do the same after Pentecost Sunday.
