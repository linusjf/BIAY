### BIAY Day 176 By Cynthia Dsilva

Hosea 10:1-15
God's people (the Israelites) were putting their trust in humans (Hosea 7:11) and worshipping false gods (statues of creation, warriors, weapons of war, etc.) (Hosea 10:1, 9, 13).  The kings were doing the opposite of what they were supposed to do and the administration of justice had fallen into corrupt hands (Hosea 10:4).  God was therefore warning them that they would fall into the hands of their enemies (the pagan countries) who would take over their inheritance (land) (Hosea 10:8-10) and enslave them because their sins would separate them from God.  Thus they would lose their earthly inheritance if they did not repent (Hosea 10:12).
This was a shadow of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, if we, God's people, worship or put our trust in humans (rich and powerful people) and false gods (statues of creation, money, possessions, celebrities, entertainment, weapons of war, etc.) God will leave us because of our sins, and we will lose our heavenly inheritance.   Thereafter we will fall into the hands of our enemy (Satan) who will oppress us with suffering (sicknesses, problems, etc.) in our lives.  If we repent and confess our sins, God will save us from our enemy (Satan) and restore our heavenly inheritance.

We can fight our spiritual enemy (Satan) by putting our trust in the true God, by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, and by fighting our earthly enemies with love, peace, prayer, fasting, etc. because we receive divine power through the sacraments.
