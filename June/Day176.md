### Day #176 Repent before time runs out

We know that God’s love is steadfast, and we cannot even comprehend how great it is for us. However, does that mean we can continue in our sin and expect God to save us by a Miracle? Our God is not only the Merciful Savior but also the just judge, who will determine our eternal state based on our faith and works. Even though God’s love is from everlasting to everlasting, our opportunity to repent is limited, limited to our lifetime and opportunities we have. If we continue in our sins and die in a poor state. We will not make it to heaven, this is serious, we should repent and change our lives in time.
Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. Hos 9:15
Many have this attitude of pushing back our repentance, repentance means a change of life. One says that once I retire, I will pray more, or once I get married, I will do this, or have excuses like I’m still young, or I am old enough to do this. We should be careful if we are pushing back our repentance, lest death catches us by surprise. The other issue that we can get into is, sin becoming a habit – sin brings us some temporary satisfaction. If we continue to do the sin repeatedly, we may not be able to get rid of it when we want to.
They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins. Hos 9:9
If we are deep in corruption/sin and have no intention to repent the Lord will not take us out of it without our intention. We should be striving to be holy and if we fall the Lord will lift us up again, for his mercy is from generation to generation, from everlasting to everlasting. Let us be sincere in our faith and pray for deliverance from sin.
Let us make all efforts to repent today and ask God for forgiveness, lest we are caught not prepared for the return of Jesus, either at the end of times or at the end of our lives whichever is sooner. The best practice is to live in a state of grace, which means always make a confession when you commit a mortal sin and go to Mass regularly as venial sins are forgiven at Mass. On Ash Wednesday we are all supposed to think of the day we will die, we need to ask ourselves are we ready to meet the Lord, are we choosing the right things in life and are we choosing Christ in every decision we make.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 176 By Cynthia Dsilva

Hosea 10:1-15
God's people (the Israelites) were putting their trust in humans (Hosea 7:11) and worshipping false gods (statues of creation, warriors, weapons of war, etc.) (Hosea 10:1, 9, 13).  The kings were doing the opposite of what they were supposed to do and the administration of justice had fallen into corrupt hands (Hosea 10:4).  God was therefore warning them that they would fall into the hands of their enemies (the pagan countries) who would take over their inheritance (land) (Hosea 10:8-10) and enslave them because their sins would separate them from God.  Thus they would lose their earthly inheritance if they did not repent (Hosea 10:12).
This was a shadow of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, if we, God's people, worship or put our trust in humans (rich and powerful people) and false gods (statues of creation, money, possessions, celebrities, entertainment, weapons of war, etc.) God will leave us because of our sins, and we will lose our heavenly inheritance.   Thereafter we will fall into the hands of our enemy (Satan) who will oppress us with suffering (sicknesses, problems, etc.) in our lives.  If we repent and confess our sins, God will save us from our enemy (Satan) and restore our heavenly inheritance.

We can fight our spiritual enemy (Satan) by putting our trust in the true God, by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, and by fighting our earthly enemies with love, peace, prayer, fasting, etc. because we receive divine power through the sacraments.
