### Day #170 Having a good mentor will keep you on track.

We see the good leadership of Joash for some time, remember he was the young kid who was hidden away when the royal family was murdered. His Good leadership lasts as long as he had good counsel from Jehoiada. Once Jehoiada died there was no one to guide King Joash - the king listened to the princes of Judah who lead him to idol worship. The Lord sent prophets for him to turn back but to no avail. Then the Lord permitted the army of the king of Damascus who had a smaller army to defeat Joash and leave him wounded. Joash‚Äôs own servants kill him in this wounded state to avenge the blood of Jehoiada‚Äôs son. The big difference is Joash was not buried with the kings but Jehoiada was buried with the Kings. Joash did not receive the honor of a good King even though he started off well.
The importance of good guidance is amplified in this life story of Joash. It is just so important to receive the right guidance, without it we can lose sight of the goal and miss the mark very easily.
It‚Äôs not easy to see one‚Äôs own error, that is why the Psalmist prays.
But who can detect their errors? Clear me from hidden faults. Ps 19:12
We need help from mentors, spiritual fathers, and counselors ‚Äì those who can prayerfully guide us and point out our mistakes. Just as prophet Nathan showed King David his mistake and John the Baptist told Herod his mistake. We need people in our lives to guide us and correct us. We need earthly shepherds who can help us hear the voice of the good shepherd.
‚Äúmy people are destroyed from lack of knowledge‚Äù Hosea 4:6
Let us pray for the Lord to lead people into our lives, mentors who can lead us on the right path. Those who can help us grow and correct us when we go wrong.
May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè
