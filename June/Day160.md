### Day #160 Watch and pray

There is a great necessity to be watchful and to sustain in prayer. Jesus tells us the parable of the man who leaves home and puts his servants in charge. The servants should be doing their work as no one knows the hour when the owner will return, lest he finds them asleep when he returns. We have these words of Jesus that we should take seriously “Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time will come.”
Our frail human nature does not make it easy for us to follow this teaching, we are easily distracted and find it hard to stay focused on prayer. Like Peter, James, and John at Gethsemane, we keep dosing off. Jesus was sorrowful and struggling in prayer He said “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death, remain here and watch”. In the Gospel of Luke, there is a mention that “Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground”. Even though Jesus is going through such suffering, the disciples find it hard to even pray for Him.
Jesus said “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you do not fall into temptations; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak”
Jesus found them sleeping two more times, their eyes were very heavy and they could not pray. Jesus asked Simon to pray three times and we know that Simon fails to pray three times. Had he prayed those three times, he would have probably had the strength to overcome his fear and would not have denied Jesus three times.
Most of us are weak because we do not pray, Jesus has overcome the world and wants us to live a victorious life. However, we are unable to pray and hence unable to reject sin. We have no power in us because we have little or no prayer life. Let us make time for prayer, even if it means waking up an hour earlier than everyone else. Spending an hour in holy adoration or attending weekday Mass. Let us pray and be strong. Watch and pray so that we will be in the state of grace when Jesus comes or when we die and go up to meet Him as the just judge. “Watch and pray!!” let’s say it again “Watch and pray!!”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
