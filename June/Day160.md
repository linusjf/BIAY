### Day #160 Watch and pray

There is a great necessity to be watchful and to sustain in prayer. Jesus tells us the parable of the man who leaves home and puts his servants in charge. The servants should be doing their work as no one knows the hour when the owner will return, lest he finds them asleep when he returns. We have these words of Jesus that we should take seriously ‚ÄúTake heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time will come.‚Äù
Our frail human nature does not make it easy for us to follow this teaching, we are easily distracted and find it hard to stay focused on prayer. Like Peter, James, and John at Gethsemane, we keep dosing off. Jesus was sorrowful and struggling in prayer He said ‚ÄúMy soul is very sorrowful, even to death, remain here and watch‚Äù. In the Gospel of Luke, there is a mention that ‚ÄúThen His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground‚Äù. Even though Jesus is going through such suffering, the disciples find it hard to even pray for Him.
Jesus said ‚ÄúSimon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you do not fall into temptations; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak‚Äù
Jesus found them sleeping two more times, their eyes were very heavy and they could not pray. Jesus asked Simon to pray three times and we know that Simon fails to pray three times. Had he prayed those three times, he would have probably had the strength to overcome his fear and would not have denied Jesus three times.
Most of us are weak because we do not pray, Jesus has overcome the world and wants us to live a victorious life. However, we are unable to pray and hence unable to reject sin. We have no power in us because we have little or no prayer life. Let us make time for prayer, even if it means waking up an hour earlier than everyone else. Spending an hour in holy adoration or attending weekday Mass. Let us pray and be strong. Watch and pray so that we will be in the state of grace when Jesus comes or when we die and go up to meet Him as the just judge. ‚ÄúWatch and pray!!‚Äù let‚Äôs say it again ‚ÄúWatch and pray!!‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 160 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 13:1-26
This prophecy is associated with Zechariah 14:4 (the day of the Lord) which says that the Messiah would come when the end is near.
The purpose of this chapter is to prepare the Church for a period of distress, trials and persecutions before the second coming of Christ. The proper Christian attitude should be not to panic or to be alarmed, but to persevere in faith till the end.

Jesus was speaking of two destructions:  the Temple and the city.

The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe.  The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.
Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city.  It was a Temple with a city around it, but it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).

Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city.  It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it.  The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally.

Mark 13:33
*Jesus said, "stay awake, be alert and pray for you know not when the time will come."*

Let us make sure to remain in a state of grace at all times by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation and Communion regularly, so that we will always be prepared to go with the Lord whenever He comes to take us.
Let us always be alert to sins of all kind so that we can avoid committing them.

Mark 14:1-2
*It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.*
God had given these two festivals to the Israelites as two separate feasts but during the time of Jesus they were both being celebrated together as desired by God.

Both feasts of the old Covenant were shadows of the Unleavened Bread (Communion) and Passover (Mass) of the new Covenant which Jesus inaugurated in the Upper Room and finished on Calvary and thereafter gave them to the Church to be celebrated until the end of time.

*The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, ‚ÄúNot during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.‚Äù*
Everything was going according to God's divine plan and God allowed the evil ones to go ahead with their plan so that God‚Äôs plan would be fulfilled.
On the day and hour when the earthly lambs would be slaughtered for the old Passover to commemorate the physical liberation of the people of the old Israel from the evil Pharaoh, on the same day and hour the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) would be killed for the new Passover to spiritually liberate the baptized people of the new Israel (the Church) from Satan.

Mark 14:7
*For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.*
Jesus was not confirming that poverty will flourish.
Jesus was reminding us of the words of Moses (Deut. 15:11).
By serving the poor we serve God.

Mark 14:22-24
*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

The priest consumes the bread and wine separately because that is how Jesus gave it to them in the Upper Room.  The sacrifice is complete only when the priest consumes both.

*This is my body ...........; This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

When God speaks, His Word does not return empty.  His words accomplish what is spoken (Isaiah 55:11; Genesis 1:3).

Therefore, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" the bread and wine became His mystical Body and Blood.
In the old Covenant, the earthly lamb was a symbol and it died after it was slaughtered, therefore it did not have the power to give the people eternal life when they received it.
In the new Covenant, by His life, death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus put the power of the Holy Spirit in the heavenly Lamb (of God) therefore this Lamb can give us eternal life when we receive it in a state of grace because this Lamb is still living even though He died after He was slaughtered.

The words of consecration can be repeated by anyone, but the transubstantiation takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit only when an apostolic priest says the exact words in obedience to the command of Jesus because the authority was given only to the ordained apostles, who in turn must give that same authority to their apostolic successors.  Therefore, if any other person repeats the words of consecration the bread and wine will still remain bread and wine; they will not be transformed.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice.  Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real.  Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired.  By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

Mark 14:44-46, 50, 66-71.
*All 12 apostles received their priestly ordination (Holy Orders) in the Upper Room and all 12 of them had the Eucharist (Communion) but shortly after that Judas betrayed Jesus, Peter denied Jesus and the remaining 10 abandoned Jesus.*
Receiving Communion or any other sacraments is not a guarantee that the devil will stop tempting us to follow him.  One mortal sin is enough for the devil to start controlling our thoughts, words and deeds, and make us use our bodies (eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc.) for sinful purposes.  He has a million ways to fool us into committing sins.  We must, therefore, remain alert to sin until the last day of our lives and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation whenever we fail.

*Jesus was taken away from the Apostles after Judas betrayed Him.  Thereafter the apostles were scattered by Satan.*
When we betray Jesus with our sins, God leaves us.  This automatically puts us in the hands of Satan whose aim is to destroy families and communities and eventually the Church, by causing division between the members and scattering them.
Let us make sure to resolve our problems peacefully and stay united with our family members as well as with our Christian community, irrespective of our differences.
