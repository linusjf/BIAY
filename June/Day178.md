### Day #178 An Incomplete mission doesn’t help

Jehu seems like a good king; however, he does not complete his full work of restoring Israel to the true faith. He was very crafty and deceptive – he asked all the people which of the 70 sons of Ahad would be a good king, and when they choose Jehu instead, he made them kill all of the sons. He even calls all the worshipers of Baal to a temple, pretending that he would pray with them – he kills them all there. He seems to be making good progress, but he stops there.
So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 2 Kings 10:28
Jehu should have done two more things, destroy the worship of the golden calves and then restore Israel to the true worship of God in the temple in Jerusalem.
We can relate to Jehu’s story, as we sometimes fail to complete our spiritual goals or exercises. We quit half ways and don’t complete our mission. Sometimes people want to give up a bad habit because it’s not good for their health. For example, an alcoholic or smoker tries to quit for health reasons and doesn’t really follow through with the spiritual connection. More than just stopping the bad habit, whatever it may be, we need to replace it with something good.
So that we are able to do good things instead of evil things.
Jesus gave this teaching
“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.” Mat 12: 43-45
We should not just get rid of the evil habits in our lives but welcome the Holy Spirit to come and make something beautiful in our lives. Let us not try to become just good people, but holy people. Once we give up our bad habits, we should welcome the Holy Spirit into that area, so it can be restored. Once restored we should be able to fill it up with the Goodness of God and help others overcome similar sins. We should not give the devil a chance, by being idle or empty. We should be filled with the Holy Spirit with the gifts and fruits. We should pray that we are fully restored to God.
Like St Paul, we should be able to say
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 2 Tim 4:7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 178 By Cynthia Dsilva

Psalm 110:1

\*The Lord said to my Lord.\*

David saw a vision of Heaven and called the Messiah "my Lord" because although the Messiah was a descendant of David He was also divine.

Psalm 110:4

\*The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”\*

This was a blessing given to David, a royal priest, and to all his succeeding royal priests until the end of time because he was the one who conquered Jerusalem and took back the throne of Melchizedek from the enemies.
Thus the new Covenant priesthood is linked to Melchizedek through Jesus who is a descendant of David.

Like Baptism, the ordination of a priest is an indelible bond, that is, he is a priest forever.

The priestly order of Melchizedek offered bread and wine to God in thanksgiving.  But that was an incomplete offering.  Jesus completed that offering by offering bread and wine to God in thanksgiving as well as in atonement for the sins of God’s people, and He commanded His Apostles/bishops to do the same.
