### Day #154 Holy Trinity

As we begin our Messianic Checkpoint with St Mark‚Äôs Gospel. It seems that it‚Äôs a rapid-fire Gospel, as it is the shortest and has fast-moving scenes. Although we can spend years contemplating the mysteries revealed, Mark keeps us moving along with the style of his writing and the repeated use of the word ‚ÄúImmediately‚Äù
The opening scene is John the Baptist preaching a message of repentance and people were getting baptized in the River Jordan. Immediately the focus shifts to Jesus, Jesus is revealed following the words ‚ÄúI have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit‚Äù
Just in the blink of an eye, we see Jesus being baptized. Rather than run with the speed of Mark let us stay here and absorb it all.
First of all, why did Jesus need to be baptized if He is God, did the water purify Him? No he was baptized just to show us the way, His baptism revealed his identity as the Son of God and He did not need to be purified but when he touched the water the waters were made Holy, just as when the unclean leaper(/the women with the flow of blood) touched Him he was not made unclean but they were made clean and whole.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.‚Äù Mark 1: 9
Given that St Marks' Gospel was the very first account of the Gospel, we are reading for the very first time the obvious revelation of the Holy Trinity. We are introduced to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the same scene. All three are divine, and all three are one God. One God ‚Äì three persons.
First of all, this is a mystery and we cannot ever fully understand a mystery. What we need to do is enter into the mystery and experience it, we cannot solve it.
It‚Äôs not a math problem, we cannot say that this math equation ‚Äú1X1X1 = 1‚Äù solves the Trinity equation.
It‚Äôs more of a who God is a thing. We have a Triune God. Father-Son-Spirit who are equal in all aspects and divine in all aspects, totally united and one.
Jesus is not created by the Father, they are of the same substance so to speak, and hence begotten, Jesus is not made, Jesus is not one of the creations that were created in the beginning when the Spirit of God hovered over the void world. There were all present even before creation, for at creation we see the conversation - "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness" and the Holy Spirit hover over the void.
When it comes to the Holy Trinity the best way to understand it is to enter into it. Enter into the mystery and discover it. To fall in love with God, the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the ‚Äúmysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.‚Äù To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel‚Äôs faith before the Incarnation of God‚Äôs Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (CCC 237)
The mystery of the Holy Trinity could be one thing that Jesus said to the disciples ‚ÄúI have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now‚Ä¶‚Äù and promised the Holy Spirit ‚Äúhe will guide you into all the truth‚Äù (16:13). The Church was guided to understand God as Triune.
Let us ask the Holy Spirit to lead us into the mystery of the Holy Trinity ‚Äì Father, Son, and Spirit. So we could be one with God - just as the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.
May the Holy Spirit lead usüôè

### DAY 154 By Sheila

Today's Study on John the Baptist centered on two messages: The repentance of sins and the Person of Jesus Christ.

At the Baptism of Jesus, The Presence of the Trinity is emphasized. Jesus The Son Of Flesh, The Holy Spirit in the form of a Dove and The Father whose voice was heard from Heaven.

Jesus' miracles primarily called attention to the Offering of the Kingdom. More and more people began to follow.

Jesus knew their thoughts, He forgave their sins and physically healed them. Jesus claimed clear, He does the work only God can do. Therefore, He is God.

Matthew was a tax-collector for Herod Antipas. He received the same invitation as Peter, Andrew, James, John and like the others, who followed Jesus immediately.

In the Psalm, the Psalmist found refuge in the Lord whom he trusted. God loves those who practice righteousness and who make right choices and display right attitudes in life.

### BIAY Day 154 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 1:2-3

\*As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, ‚ÄúSee, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.‚Äù\*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God had promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father so that the new Israel (Jesus) could lead them in their new exodus toward the promised land (Malachi 3:1).

\*‚ÄúPrepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.‚Äù\*

To prepare the way, for the Lord to enter their hearts, the people had to begin with repentance.

God had already prepared the way (a sinless womb) for the arrival of His Son into the world and Mary maintained the sanctity of her womb by ensuring that she always stayed out of sin so she received the Body of Christ into her body in a state of grace.

Like Mary, we too must do our best to remain out of sin at all times so that we can always receive the Body of Christ (Communion) into our bodies in a state of grace.

Mark 1:12‚Äì15
\*The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan;\*
God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

Mark 1:35
\*In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.\*

This was *God praying to God* in the early hours of the morning.

By waking up before dawn, going to an isolated place and spending time with God the Father, Jesus gave us a template for prayer.  Jesus gave more importance to His time with God and adjusted His daily schedule in the rest of the time.

Inspite of His busy schedule Jesus always made it a point to spend time with God in solitude.  He expects us to do the same.  However busy we are with our earthly duties and commitments, we must spend sufficient time with God every day.

If Jesus humbled Himself to this level then we cannot make excuses to pray every morning.  We must keep our mornings free for God and fit our daily schedule in the rest of the time.  Our priority must be given to our time with God and not to our daily schedule.

Morning is the best time to pray so that we can start the day with the Lord, and Jesus is the best example (Psalm 90:14; 143:8-10). We can choose to be with the Lord in many ways like going to Church for the morning service or sitting alone in silence and speaking to the Lord, or getting together with family and praying, etc.
