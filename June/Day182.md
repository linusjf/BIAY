### Day #182 God’s inescapable love.

Psalm 139 is my all-time favorite Psalm, it always takes me back to a warm safe place. (I stole this line from Guns N Roses – sweet child of mine)
You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely. Ps 139:2-4
We usually tend to think of our relationship with God as something that needs to be worked on, more like – I didn’t say my prayers, or I didn’t read the Bible today. In reality, our relationship with God is not something that we initiate but is always in response to God’s calling. For we do not even know how to pray according to Rom 8:26 “In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.”
God created us and knows everything about us, just as a scientist knows everything about the robot he programmed – the only difference is we have free will.
God knows our every move, every thought, and feeling, and even knows our future actions. He knows when we sit when we rise and even before a word is on our lips, he already knows it. Even though God created us and knows our past present and future, he does not force His way on us, he gives us free will. He wants us to freely choose Him over the pleasure of the world.
You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. Ps 139:5,6
God has put a hedge of protection around us, angles patrol around us, and they protect us - not even letting our foot hit a stone. He is like the Father of the Prodigal son who waits for us every day to return, even though the whole world belongs to God we are his prize position, the apple of His eye. He waits for us to return to Him in prayer, He’s like a parent of a newborn – watching every move of the baby and ensuring the baby is not harmed, feeding it on time, and caring for the baby. He loves us far more than an earthly parent can, for it was Him who created us.
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. Ps 139:13,14
We are all created uniquely by God, each one of us is a masterpiece of the master craft maker. Let us never feel inferior to another, every bit of us – shape, size, color, skin tone, hair, and body structure were all made by him. We need not do anything to ourselves to be loved by him or anyone else on earth – for we are fearfully and wonderfully made. A warning to anyone who discriminates based on color, body type, or physical beauty – you are going against God the creation of every human being. He made everyone equal.
How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand— when I awake, I am still with you. Ps 139:17-18
God’s thoughts towards us are innumerable which means we are always on His mind. Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed that God loves us so much and knows everything about us, we may want to run away, we may want to hide like Adam and Eve – because of our evil deeds. But where can we go from God’s Spirit, where can we run but can’t hide. We may think that we can hide under cover of sin, pleasure, laziness, comfort, money, and experiences, but can never escape God’s, inescapable love.
God does not come after us like a bounty hunter to catch us for our wrongdoings, but waits for us as the father of a prodigal son, knows our whereabouts, yet patiently and loving waits with his arms open wide for us to return.
May we all return to the warm comfort of the Father's Bosom. He is waiting for you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 182 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 16:3

\*He (King Ahaz) walked in the way of the kings of Israel; he even immolated his child by fire, in accordance with the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.\*

The pagans believed that sacrificing live children to the pagan gods would bring them prosperity, and Ahaz was no exception.  Ahaz belonged to God’s family but like the pagans and many other Israelites, he too desired prosperity more than his children and God’s Will.

Unfortunately this ugly story still continues to this day, which is one of the reasons for so much suffering in this world.  We may not be immolating our live children to the false gods of prosperity, but, in today’s world, millions of Christians have given “immolation” a new name and it is called “abortion.”  Millions of unborn children continue to be aborted every year because the parents want prosperity, comfort and an easy life.

May the Lord bring those people to repentance.
May the Lord have mercy on those guilty of this crime.
May the Lord help them to come out of the darkness and walk in His light.
