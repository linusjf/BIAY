### Day #166 Was prophet Elijah mean to the Widow

We read the story of Elijah‘s visit to the widow at Zarephath, God asked the prophet to visit the widow as she would feed him in the drought. Now remember its severe drought and widows in the ancient Jewish society were the poorest as they had very less means of income. This poor widow was collecting sticks to possible cook her last meal, she and her son were going to eat this last meal and die of starvation after that.
Now we see Elijah almost being insensitive to her when he asks for water and a meal. He said bring me water, and while she was going to fetch it – he said bring me a meal. It appears as though God brough Elijah all the way to Zarephath just to be mean to this poor widow.
Not so, when she shared her difficulties – Elijah said to her,
“Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son. 14 For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” 1 Kings 14:13
This widow heard God’s word and acted on it, she did as the prophet told her and her household had food for many days the jug of oil did not fail nor was the meal emptied.
Elijah initially seemed mean but he wasn’t, he was just trying to test the widow and help her build up her faith. God is kind and loving and sometimes tests our faith not to insult us or to trouble us – but to help our faith grow so we can receive the Miracle.
Don’t we even recall Jesus doing such a thing in the incident with the Canaanite woman.
The Canaanites were gentiles and when she followed Jesus asking for the deliverance of her daughter – Jesus seems to be mean when he said “It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” She said yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table. Jesus answered “O woman, great is your faith. Be it done for you as you desire” and her daughter was healed immediately. Here we see that Jesus kinda lead the women to have deeper stronger faith, his initial words seems mean but it made her stronger and built her faith.
So the next time we feel that we do not get what we want and are being pushed to the limit, let us remember that there is a Miracle waiting on the other side of our trials. Have faith!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

1 Kings 17:10-16
By being more concerned about his hunger and not caring about the widow’s problem, Elijah sounds like a selfish man.  But Elijah was testing the widow’s faith in God.  The widow, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah, a man of God, and the promise of his Lord.  Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family.

The poor widow was not successful in her material life, yet she gave all that she had, unselfishly, even though she was left empty handed and not sure when her next meal was going to come.  She willingly gave because she wanted to please God, even if it meant that she would have to starve.

The widow was a shadow of Mary (the widowed mother of Jesus).  Mary too was not successful in her material life, yet she took care of the Son of God and unselfishly gave up her only Son because she wanted to please God.

The poor widow willingly gave her tithe to the man of God, in the form of food, and God multiplied the flour and oil so that the jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran dry.

The flour was a shadow of the Eucharist (of which it is an ingredient) and the oil was a shadow of the priesthood (priests are anointed with oil).

If we are generous in giving our tithes to the Church to support the men of God (the priests) then God will bless us abundantly (2 Corinthians 9:6-8) and our parish will always have sufficient priests to provide us with the Bread of life (Eucharist) as long as we live.

1 Kings 18:41-46
King Ahab and his wife Jezebel had killed all the Lord’s prophets and they also wanted Elijah dead (1 Kings 19:10).  Ahab had even sent his man Obadiah to search for Elijah all over Israel and in all the neighboring nations (1 Kings 18:10), and yet Elijah shared the Word of God with the same Ahab, and prayed to God to give them rain, inspite of facing persecution, opposition, slander and subversion from the same King Ahab.

Elijah did not take revenge on Ahab and Jezebel.  He knew that he had to forgive his offenders if he wanted God to forgive him his sins.  Elijah was a man of God, a mediator between God and man, and by forgiving his offenders, inspite of what they had done to him, he set a great example for his congregation.

Like Elijah, let us always remember to forgive our offenders irrespective of how much they have hurt us.  Let us not think of retaliating or taking revenge in any way.

"Forgive us Lord, as we forgive those who sin against us" (Matthew 6:12).
