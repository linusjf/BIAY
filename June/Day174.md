### Day #174 It‚Äôs sometimes hard to follow simple instructions

Naaman had everything going well for him, he was a commander in the army a great man, and in high favor of this master. However, his problem was that he had Leprosy, which was not curable at that time. Long story short, he is at Elisha‚Äôs house asking for a Miracle. Elisha gives him a simple thing to do, he said: ‚ÄúGo, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.‚Äù
However Naaman does not want to follow it because it is too simple, he said ‚Äú‚ÄúI thought that for me he would surely come out and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and would wave his hand over the spot and cure the skin disease!‚Äù after his servants persuaded him to follow the instruction he did and was healed.
Isn‚Äôt it the same with us, we want something extraordinary, out of this world to happen when all it takes is a simple prayer? Christ died for us and paid the heavy price, the hard work is done. He invites us to just stay close to him, and follow his instructions. However, we want to be adventurous and explore the different pleasures of this world. He calls us to rest in him and to take His yoke which is light and easy.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." Mat 11:28-30
Instead of simply following the voice of Jesus we tend to get distracted by the pleasure of the world and satan‚Äôs empty promises. Our faith life will grow drastically if we are able to do the simple yet very effective things, like going to daily Mass, praying our rosary, reading our bible, personal and family prayers, and doing acts of charity and deeds of kindness.
Instead of simply being faithful to the practices of faith, we start dabbling with the world, and its glitter. Our relationship with the Lord may end up like the example of Hosea who married a harlot, the Lord asked him to do that just so that he would experience the pain Israel caused God.
Our lives can sometimes be compared to Hosea‚Äôs harlot, who left him even though he gave her everything she so desired. Even though God gives us everything we so desire, we end up leaving the Lord for the passing pleasures of the world. Let us return to him with a whole heart, lest the Lord starts to take away the things that we like.
The Harlot of Hosea did not acknowledge that God was the one who gave her grain, new wine, oil, silver, and gold. The Lord said he would take away these things only for her to realize that it was not her lovers that gave her these gifts, it was the Lord who is the source of all things good.
This could sometimes be the case with us, the Lord may have to withhold some things from us so that we can turn to him. We may experience a health issue or a financial issue or any problem that will lead us to pray and turn back to the Lord. Because if we receive everything we want all the time we may forget the giver, who is our beautiful Lord Jesus.
Let us turn to the Lord and love Him with all our hearts. Let us not stray from his love.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 174 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 5:1-14
The waters of the Jordan River did not have any magic in them.
God wanted Naaman to sacrifice his pride which was the cause of his suffering.
Pride is the source of most sins and therefore the cause of most of our sufferings.  Naaman‚Äôs pride had almost blocked God from performing a miracle in his life.  If Naaman would have gone back home without dipping himself in the river Jordan, he would have remained a leper all his life.

Are we proud and boastful of our fame, popularity, position, status, etc. in society?  If we are, then let us humble ourselves and come down to earth.  Righteousness begins with humility.  Pride blocks God from using us to work through us for His divine mission and pouring blessings into our lives.

By asking Namaan to dip himself in the river 7 times, God was making a Covenant (Sheba) with him.
Naaman‚Äôs diseased flesh was made clean and like that of a little child when he shed his pride and dipped himself in the river.

Our souls too have been cleansed of sin by the waters of Baptism, and we experience this cleansing again and again when we shed our pride, repent for our sins and receive mercy from our Lord Jesus through the Sacrament of Reconciliation when He renews His Covenant with us.

*Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, ‚ÄúGo, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.‚Äù*
The Jordan river is a symbol of the river of life
Seven times means God was extending His Covenant to the gentile nations around Israel to purify themselves like the skin of Naaman and enter His Kingdom with thanksgiving, just as Naaman returned to Israel after he was healed, to thank the God of Israel.

2 Kings 5:15-16
Naaman came back to thank God for the blessing which he had received.
How many of us remember to thank God for taking care of us after the crisis is over?

2 Kings 5:19-27
Elisha had refused the gifts from Naaman, but greed entered the heart of Elisha‚Äôs servant (Gehazi) and when he saw that Naaman‚Äôs expensive gifts were refused by Elisha, he followed Naaman, lied to him and got some of the gifts for himself.
Gehazi had desired to accumulate wealth for himself and for his descendants but instead he got leprosy for himself and for his descendants.
Leprosy was a symbol of sin and accumulating material goods is the result of sin (greed).

No matter how much wealth and possessions we accumulate in this life for ourselves and for our descendants, our wealth and possessions will not be able to give us and our descendants eternal life.  It is only our relationship with Jesus and our holy life that will save us from Hell.  And it is only the spiritual nourishment which we give our descendants that will save them from Hell.

God blesses us with success to share it with others.  Accumulating it four ourselves brings curses into our lives for ourselves and for our families.  Gehazi was just an example.  Let us not fall into the temptation of accumulating earthly gifts.
Let us always try to be an Elisha, not a Gehazi.

Hosea 1:2-9
Hosea was not only called to deliver the Word of God to the immoral people who were committing physical and spiritual adultery, but he was also called to be a symbol of God to those people, while his unfaithful bride was a symbol of unfaithful Israel whom Satan always tried to take away from her groom with his deceptive offers.
Hosea was a humble man and a faithful husband even though his wife was leading an immoral and adulterous life.  Therefore, through Hosea's life God wanted Israel to have a living example of how faithful God was to His people even though they were running after false gods and leading ungodly lives, and how patiently God had been waiting for thousands of years for His bride (Israel) to come back to Him.

In the Old Covenant the unfaithful bride (the sinful Israelites) could repent but could not return home (Heaven) due to her uncleanness but in the New Covenant, God gave His unfaithful bride (the sinful Christians) the option to repent and purify herself and renew her Covenant/marriage vows with Christ, through the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and thereafter unite herself with Christ in marriage again by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) (John 6:54), during every Mass, so that she can be with Him for eternity.

At the end of time Jesus (the bridegroom) will come and take His bride (the saints of the Church) to His Father‚Äôs House (Heaven) where there will be rejoicing forever, but while the bride (the Church) is still on earth she can cover herself with a white robe only after she purifies herself.
