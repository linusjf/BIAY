### Day #174 It‚Äôs sometimes hard to follow simple instructions.

Naaman had everything going well for him, he was a commander in the army a great man, and in high favor of this master. However, his problem was that he had Leprosy, which was not curable at that time. Long story short, he is at Elisha‚Äôs house asking for a Miracle. Elisha gives him a simple thing to do, he said: ‚ÄúGo, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.‚Äù
However Naaman does not want to follow it because it is too simple, he said ‚Äú‚ÄúI thought that for me he would surely come out and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and would wave his hand over the spot and cure the skin disease!‚Äù after his servants persuaded him to follow the instruction he did and was healed.
Isn‚Äôt it the same with us, we want something extraordinary, out of this world to happen when all it takes is a simple prayer? Christ died for us and paid the heavy price, the hard work is done. He invites us to just stay close to him, and follow his instructions. However, we want to be adventurous and explore the different pleasures of this world. He calls us to rest in him and to take His yoke which is light and easy.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." Mat 11:28-30
Instead of simply following the voice of Jesus we tend to get distracted by the pleasure of the world and satan‚Äôs empty promises. Our faith life will grow drastically if we are able to do the simple yet very effective things, like going to daily Mass, praying our rosary, reading our bible, personal and family prayers, and doing acts of charity and deeds of kindness.
Instead of simply being faithful to the practices of faith, we start dabbling with the world, and its glitter. Our relationship with the Lord may end up like the example of Hosea who married a harlot, the Lord asked him to do that just so that he would experience the pain Israel caused God.
Our lives can sometimes be compared to Hosea‚Äôs harlot, who left him even though he gave her everything she so desired. Even though God gives us everything we so desire, we end up leaving the Lord for the passing pleasures of the world. Let us return to him with a whole heart, lest the Lord starts to take away the things that we like.
The Harlot of Hosea did not acknowledge that God was the one who gave her grain, new wine, oil, silver, and gold. The Lord said he would take away these things only for her to realize that it was not her lovers that gave her these gifts, it was the Lord who is the source of all things good.
This could sometimes be the case with us, the Lord may have to withhold some things from us so that we can turn to him. We may experience a health issue or a financial issue or any problem that will lead us to pray and turn back to the Lord. Because if we receive everything we want all the time we may forget the giver, who is our beautiful Lord Jesus.
Let us turn to the Lord and love Him with all our hearts. Let us not stray from his love.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
