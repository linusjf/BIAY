### Day #175 The steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting

One cannot ever fully comprehend the love of God. That is why St Paul prays for us that we may have the power to comprehend the love of God, its height, breadth, length, and depth. It surpasses human knowledge, we may never be able to fully understand the love of God.
I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God Ep 3:18
The steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, as far as the east is from the west, as high as the heaven is from the earth.
God does not deal with us as our sins desire, he is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, he forgives all our sins, and he knows that we are merely but a wildflower that is there today and gone tomorrow.
As for mortals, their days are like grass; they flourish like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, Ps 103:15-16
He forgives us of our sins because he knows that we are weak. He casts our sin as far as the east is from the west. Let us bless the Lord, with our whole soul, heart, mind, and body.
Joining the Psalmist we should praise God and bless His name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Ps 103:1
This is such a beautiful psalm, and we should include it in our daily prayers. This song helps us reflect on the Psalm.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 175 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 6:16-17
When Prophet Elisha was surrounded by the Aramean king‚Äôs human army, who were sent to kill Elisha, Elisha prayed to God and God sent him immediate supernatural help which only Elisha could see.  But Elisha‚Äôs servant could not see the supernatural help so he panicked.  Then Elisha prayed to the Lord again to open the eyes of his servant so that he could see the supernatural help sent by God, and the servant saw that they were surrounded by fiery chariots and horses which the human eyes could not see.  God‚Äôs army had outnumbered the king‚Äôs army.

Like Elisha‚Äôs servant, whenever we face major problems in life we usually have the tendency to focus on the earthly problem and then we either panic or we go into depression and tears or we look for quick ungodly solutions.

When we face problems created by others, we look at the person as a bad person and we react negatively towards that person.  We don‚Äôt see the spiritual side of the problem because we are in the habit of living by ‚Äú*sight*‚Äù not by ‚Äú*faith.*‚Äù
We look at the problem with our physical eyes, not with our spiritual eyes.

All problems (big or small) are created by Satan to take us away from God and to make us walk on the wrong path.
On one side Satan will create problems through some of his human disciples to stir up our pride or fear.
If our pride is stirred up we end up destroying relations, property, life, etc.
If our fear is stirred up then on the other side, the evil one will send his other human disciples to give us ungodly solutions on how to get rid of the problem by doing the wrong things.

Satan does not have liberty to create any problems in our lives without God‚Äôs permission.  God allows problems in our lives to strengthen our faith, to trust in Him, and to lead us on the right path to carry out His mission, which may not always be a smooth road; but instead, we focus on the problems and we miss the real point of why God allowed the problem in the first place.

In every negative situation, let us remain calm, ensure that we continue doing everything according to God‚Äôs Will, trust in Him and ask Him to help us through the problem.

It is both our faith and trust in God that enables us to experience the presence of God whom we can‚Äôt see.

The Holy Spirit, who dwells within us from the time we are baptized, is greater than any worldly power which is dominated by evil spirits (1 John: 4:4).
Therefore, in every negative situation, let us remain calm and put our faith and trust in God, not in humans, while we continue doing God‚Äôs work.

Hosea 6:1-2
When we want to sow a seed in the soil we must break the soil first to prepare it for receiving the seed. Then we sow the seed and water it.

Similarly, when God wants to sow the seed of His Word and His love in our hearts He will first break us by allowing problems in our lives.  We must therefore be attentive to any problems that come our way.  Once the Word is sown in our hearts, God will water it by connecting us to the right teachers who will teach us about His love through His Word.

Hosea 6:6

\*I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\*

Before offering our gifts / sacrifice on the Altar, God wants us to make peace with everyone around us and change our anger, hatred, enmity (Matthew 5:23-24), greed, selfishness, etc. into love, compassion and kindness, because we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor/brother (1 John 4:20) and we cannot receive the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ unworthily (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).

When our hearts are not driven by love and compassion for the less fortunate ones then offering the unblemished sacrifice on the Altar has no meaning because we are not being imitators of God (Matthew 12:7).  The sacrifice must be offered on the Altar with the same pure, unconditional, sacrificial love and compassion which Jesus had for us when He offered Himself as a sacrifice.
