### Day #169 Protecting the children ‚Äì they are the future

When Athaliah was about to murder all the heirs of the Kingdom of Judah, Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered. Once Athaliah was slain, they made the 7-year-old kid Joash King. There is an important lesson to learn from Jehosheba who helped save an heir to the throne and those elders who guided the young King to rule.
There are other times in the Bible where the infants have been hidden away, like Moses in the basket on the Nile(and in Pharoah's palace) and even baby Jesus was taken by Joseph and Mary to Egypt.
The lesson to learn is we need to protect the children, from all harm. We need to help shape their minds and build up their faith, make them capable of leading a nation.
Make them leaders of the nations, holy leaders who will stand up for what is holy and true.
Even Jesus in his public ministry uplifted the children, in a time when children had little value.
People were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them; and when the disciples saw it, they sternly ordered them not to do it. But Jesus called for them and said, ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Luke 18:15,16
Also Jesus warns us about leading the children into sin.
If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. Mat 18:6
We live in a generation that has committed great sins against children. We have seen so many pedophile cases and so many kids have been abused even before they reach the age of reason. In many cases the adults who are supposed to care for them, end up abusing them. It's shocking to know that parents, guardians, clergy, teachers, grandparents, scout leaders, coaches, and the list goes on, have actually abused little kids which have impacted the kids for life.
Feel so grateful for those good teachers, parents, grandparents, coaches, clergy, and youth ministers‚Ä¶.who sacrifice their lives to care for the young, they help build up the next generation. For there are far more good people than bad.
Let us be guardians to the kids in our world today, and be role models through our life examples.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
