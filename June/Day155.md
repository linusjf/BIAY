### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
Jesus’ answer may shock you, let's read it.
“To you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.’”
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah – when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God’s forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
“Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.” He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It’s due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times “Whoever has ears, let them hear ”. It’s not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It’s meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don’t really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as – no good farmer will ever sow in these places – this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God’s word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God’s words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let’s try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 155 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 3:14
*And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles.*

When Jesus chose Judas to be one of His apostles, he was well aware that Judas was a thief.  Inspite of this, Jesus kept Judas in charge of the money collection bag.  Jesus gave Judas the opportunity to change himself and take care of the money bag honestly; but since Judas never had any intention to change himself, he chose to constantly steal money from the bag.

A man does not become a priest by his own wish but only when called by God (Hebrews 5:4).  Therefore, Jesus chose Judas because it was God’s Will.  So along with the good ones, God calls the ungodly ones also.  God allows problems in the lives of the priests so that the good ones can go through spiritual healing and the holy ones can be glorified.  In the meanwhile, the ungodly ones have a chance to mix with the good ones and transform themselves.

Satan used Judas to destroy God’s plan for redemption, but God transformed that evil into good by giving us redemption through the Blood of Christ, according to His plan, exactly as it was prophesied, and thus Jesus (the holy one) was glorified.

A smooth and comfortable life does not prove that a priest or his congregation are worthy to enter the gates of heaven.  We must be tested for trust, obedience to God and righteousness, and God allows Satan to create obstacles in our path.

On the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front.  Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers).  Our duty as Christians is to handle the negative situation using God’s weapons (peace, unity, prayer, fasting, etc.).

Jesus showed us that even though all the Judases may betray Him by committing mortal sins, the Church (the mystical Body of Christ / the saints) will reach the promised land (Heaven), just as the physical Body of Christ did.  We, the beloved disciples, are called to stand with the Church (the Body of Christ), through good times and bad times, to the end (John 19:26).

When we commit a mortal sin, we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified.  Let us therefore ensure to keep our souls purified at all times.

The 12 Apostles didn't have much in common.
Matthew, the tax collector, was working for Rome, whereas Simon, the zealot, was bent on eliminating Rome.   Judas was a thief, and some were fishermen. But surprisingly they were all united in Christ. Whatever their backgrounds they never fought with each other.

Mark 3:27
Jesus came to this area to bind the strong man (Satan) and take back what belonged to God (the man who was possessed by demons).

In the old Covenant, Jesus exorcized the demons from the people by His physical presence .
In the new Covenant, Jesus exorcizes the demons from our souls spiritually through the sacraments.

Mark 3:33-35
*But he said to them in reply, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”  And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”*

Jesus was upgrading all His disciples who believe in Him and obey the Will of God, of whom His Mother was the first and best example.
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to carry the promised Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Jesus asked the question and answered it Himself, thus making it known to all His disciples (present & future), that His mother perfectly fulfilled the role of being His  Mother by her obedience and complete surrender to the Will of God.  The Mother of Jesus is the first Christian who accepted Jesus even before He was born.  By His question and answer, Jesus was also exalting His mother.
