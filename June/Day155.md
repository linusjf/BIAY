### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
Jesus’ answer may shock you, let's read it.
“To you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.’”
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah – when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God’s forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
“Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.” He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It’s due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times “Whoever has ears, let them hear ”. It’s not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It’s meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don’t really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as – no good farmer will ever sow in these places – this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God’s word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God’s words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let’s try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
