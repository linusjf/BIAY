### Day 159 The Fig tree from Genesis

The day after Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, we see Jesus cursing the fig tree. It seems kind of odd, as though Jesus is having a bad Monday. The Gospel says ‚Äòfor it was not the season for figs‚Äô Mark 11:13 ‚Äì why would Jesus expect figs when it‚Äôs not fig season.
Before the deeper analysis, we should ask ourselves the obvious. Why would Jesus curse a tree that had no fruit? One obvious reason would be the lack of fruit.
We are called to bear fruit and be fruitful. Jesus did use the example of tree and fruits a few times ‚Äì like the one where the good tree bears good fruits, and the even tree bears evil fruits. Also about the vine and the branches, the branches that do not bear fruit will be removed and the branches that bear fruit will be pruned to bear more fruit. Another one was the parable of the barren tree where the gardener pleads for one more year. The idea of a tree and its fruit is not new to the Jews, prophet Isaiah had warned them about the Vineyard that yielded wild grapes instead of good ones. So whenever Jesus used these parables they would have almost immediately latched on to the idea.
Let‚Äôs take a different look at the cursing of the fig tree today, Jesus curses a fig tree why only a fig tree and not a palm tree or olive tree. One connection that we can make is the fig tree from Genesis. Although no fig tree is mentioned, we have a mention of the fig leaves.
Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7
Most paintings of the original sin have the apple as the fruit that was eaten by Eve and then Adam. However, this may be a painter‚Äôs imagination as there is no mention of an apple tree in Genesis. The only description of a fruit tree can be taken from the fig leaves. If the tree that our first parents ate from is a fig tree, it kind of makes some sense that the new Adam Jesus ‚Äì did not eat the fruit, instead, he cursed the tree and said to it
‚ÄúHe said to it, ‚ÄòMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.‚Äô And his disciples heard it.‚Äù Mark 11:14
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
Jesus came to destroy sin and set us free from sin. That is why he said may no one ever eat the fruit of the tree of sin. He came to liberate us, to give us forgiveness and the power to avoid sin. We are called to bear fruit of holiness and fruit of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control(Gal 5:22)
Soon after the fig tree cursing Jesus entered the temple and cleansed it, Jesus is most certainly targeting sin, the original sin of disobedience. We have not only eaten the forbidden fruit but made God‚Äôs temple a trading place. Like the temple authorities, we tend to shift the focus from the worship of God to earthly things.
Finally, we see Jesus telling the parable of the wicked tenants where a man planted a vineyard and leased it out to tenants who seized and killed many of the owners‚Äô servants. The twist in the parable comes when the owner sends his only son, instead of an army. Jesus is describing his own life death and resurrection ‚Äì one hint would be that in the parable the son was cast out of the vineyard and killed referring to Jesus' crucifixion outside the city of Jerusalem.
Let us be encouraged by what Jesus did for us, He come to this world and cursed sin, then sacrificed his own life for us and we now have a new tree of life, the cross.
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Mark 11:2
*You will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden.*

Why bring a colt that has never been ridden?
Because it was in line with God's command to Moses:
An animal meant for sacred purpose was not to be put to any profane use (Numbers 19:2).  But that was only a shadow of the reality.

The womb that bore Jesus was meant to be exclusively for Him.
The tomb where He was buried was meant to be exclusively for Him.
Similarly, He would ride a colt that was meant to be exclusively for Him, while on His way to Jerusalem to be received by His people as their King.
This was God‚Äôs Will to emphasize the divinity of His Son.

Mark 11:11
*Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple area.*

A victorious earthly king of an earthly kingdom would normally enter his palace and sit on the throne after his people welcomed him with joy, but Jesus was the heavenly King of a holy Kingdom and therefore He entered the Temple after He was welcomed.

Mark 11:13-14
God‚Äôs people, who are spiritually fruitful, are like good figs and will be rewarded.  Those who fail to be spiritually fruitful are like the bad figs and will be destroyed (Hosea 9:10; Jeremiah 24:8-10).

Mark 11:15-16
*Jesus made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ.  Even if it was a shadow it was sacred because it was consecrated.  Jesus noticed that the Sanhedrin had profaned the Temple by permitting the people to use it as a marketplace.
He therefore purged out what was wrong and then taught them to do what is right.  He drove out those who profaned the Temple and showed displeasure at those who turned the place of worship into a place for worldly gain.

The Church building too is a sacred place because it is consecrated but the Church is the real Body of Christ.  The Bishops and Pastors must take care to ensure that they do not permit the people to use the Church building for ungodly purposes or else they will be profaning it.

Our bodies are Temples of the Holy Spirit because we are consecrated (baptized).  Therefore, we must ensure to detach ourselves from worldly things and purge out all our sins  by receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that we can be in a state of grace before we receive the Body of Christ (Communion)  (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Mark 12:41-44
The poor widow possessed only two coins and had nothing else to live on.  Yet, without any hesitation she gave all that she had, to support God‚Äôs priests in the Temple.
This may have reminded Jesus of His own widowed mother, whose only support for her livelihood was her one son.  Nevertheless, she too willingly offered Him completely to serve God, without asking for any benefits for herself and without thinking of herself and her future.
In appreciating the widow with the two coins, Jesus deeply appreciated His own mother‚Äôs sacrifice.

Some centuries ago, the widow in Zarephath, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah and the promise of his Lord.  Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family (1 Kings 17:10-16).

These poor widows were not successful in their material lives, yet they gave all that they had, unselfishly, even though they were left empty handed and not sure when their next meal was going to come.  They willingly gave because they wanted to please God, not humans.  They mirror the love of God the Father in giving His only Son, and Christ‚Äôs love in sacrificing Himself on the Cross.

God sees everything and He also sees what we offer.  He is interested only in the quality of our offerings, not the quantity.  God sees our heart when we offer.

A Church parish which is made up of selfish and comfortable Christians, cannot stand for long.  The parish flourishes only when we Christians, who are cells in the Body of Christ, take care of the Priests and the less fortunate ones, which is one of the fundamental aspect of our Christian life.  If we say we love God but our love for God does not convert into caring for others and generous giving to the Kingdom of God on earth, then our love for God is fake love.

Whatever we possess all belongs to God (Psalm 24:1) and we don‚Äôt take anything with us when we die (1 Timothy 6:7).
So let us not be selfish with our giving.  Let us keep our eyes and ears open so that we can be aware if God is telling us or showing us who He wants us to help.
