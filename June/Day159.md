### Day 159 The Fig tree from Genesis.

The day after Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, we see Jesus cursing the fig tree. It seems kind of odd, as though Jesus is having a bad Monday. The Gospel says ‘for it was not the season for figs’ Mark 11:13 – why would Jesus expect figs when it’s not fig season.
Before the deeper analysis, we should ask ourselves the obvious. Why would Jesus curse a tree that had no fruit? One obvious reason would be the lack of fruit.
We are called to bear fruit and be fruitful. Jesus did use the example of tree and fruits a few times – like the one where the good tree bears good fruits, and the even tree bears evil fruits. Also about the vine and the branches, the branches that do not bear fruit will be removed and the branches that bear fruit will be pruned to bear more fruit. Another one was the parable of the barren tree where the gardener pleads for one more year. The idea of a tree and its fruit is not new to the Jews, prophet Isaiah had warned them about the Vineyard that yielded wild grapes instead of good ones. So whenever Jesus used these parables they would have almost immediately latched on to the idea.
Let’s take a different look at the cursing of the fig tree today, Jesus curses a fig tree why only a fig tree and not a palm tree or olive tree. One connection that we can make is the fig tree from Genesis. Although no fig tree is mentioned, we have a mention of the fig leaves.
Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7
Most paintings of the original sin have the apple as the fruit that was eaten by Eve and then Adam. However, this may be a painter’s imagination as there is no mention of an apple tree in Genesis. The only description of a fruit tree can be taken from the fig leaves. If the tree that our first parents ate from is a fig tree, it kind of makes some sense that the new Adam Jesus – did not eat the fruit, instead, he cursed the tree and said to it
“He said to it, ‘May no one ever eat fruit from you again.’ And his disciples heard it.” Mark 11:14
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
Jesus came to destroy sin and set us free from sin. That is why he said may no one ever eat the fruit of the tree of sin. He came to liberate us, to give us forgiveness and the power to avoid sin. We are called to bear fruit of holiness and fruit of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control(Gal 5:22)
Soon after the fig tree cursing Jesus entered the temple and cleansed it, Jesus is most certainly targeting sin, the original sin of disobedience. We have not only eaten the forbidden fruit but made God’s temple a trading place. Like the temple authorities, we tend to shift the focus from the worship of God to earthly things.
Finally, we see Jesus telling the parable of the wicked tenants where a man planted a vineyard and leased it out to tenants who seized and killed many of the owners’ servants. The twist in the parable comes when the owner sends his only son, instead of an army. Jesus is describing his own life death and resurrection – one hint would be that in the parable the son was cast out of the vineyard and killed referring to Jesus' crucifixion outside the city of Jerusalem.
Let us be encouraged by what Jesus did for us, He come to this world and cursed sin, then sacrificed his own life for us and we now have a new tree of life, the cross.
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
