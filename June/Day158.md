### Day #158 The Transfiguration - a Theophany

The Transfiguration is one of those events in Jesus’ life that we are very familiar with. Sometimes being too familiar causes us to overlook certain things. The purpose of the Transfiguration as most of us know is to reveal Jesus’s divinity. We know Jesus is divine and we read everything else based on this knowledge.
But for the apostles and first-century Jewish and pagan people, they are discovering the fact that Jesus is actually divine.
Mountain:
The first item to analyze is the “Mountain” Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain. As we have been studying the OT we know that the Mountains are symbolic for God experiences – Moses goes up the mountain to encounter the Lord face to face (although he does not see God face to face, but was able to see the glory of God as God passed by) Also Mount Zion is the place where they went up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple built by King Solomon.
When Jesus took them up the Mountain, they would have known that there is going to be a God experience – a “Theophany”.
Moses & Elijah:
Now, wait a minute what are they doing here in the NT. We know that Moses is dead and Elijah was taken up into heaven. The thing that is common between the two is they both went up a mountain to meet God, they had a Theophany. Moses represents the Law and Elijah represents the Prophets. We know that both Moses and Elijah had to hide their face in the OT – Moses saw the back for God and Elijah hide his face when he recognized God in the wind, but now we see them “talking” to Jesus. They were unable to see the glory of God, but now Jesus bridges the gap and we human beings can speak to God.
Bright Clothing, Voice, and Cloud:
Jesus’ “garments” became “glistening” or intensely white. This is symbolic that He is divine, this was the way heavenly creatures were represented. Jesus gives the apostle a glimpse of the hidden glory hidden under his human flesh. We also hear the voice of God – affirming that Jesus is God.
“This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”. The cloud mentioned here represents the presence of God, just as it used to come down in the temple/tabernacle/ holy of holies – and everyone was in awe and could not even enter the temple. Similar to the experience that Mary had when the Holy Spirit overshadowed her at the annunciation. Looks like Peter James and John experienced this Theophany - an encounter with God, where Jesus is revealed to them as God, a God that we can talk to.
Booths
Peter made an interesting recommendation to build 3 booths. What he seems to be referring to here is the feast of the booths. We have read about it in Exodus where they would make tents/booths/tabernacles and stay in them, feasting on the fruit of the harvest – as an icon of the resurrection. Peter is carried away and thinks it's already Resurrection.
Hope this helps us enrich our experience of the Transfiguration. May we have a Theophany experience the next time we go to adoration.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
