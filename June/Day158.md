### Day #158 The Transfiguration - a Theophany

The Transfiguration is one of those events in Jesus’ life that we are very familiar with. Sometimes being too familiar causes us to overlook certain things. The purpose of the Transfiguration as most of us know is to reveal Jesus’s divinity. We know Jesus is divine and we read everything else based on this knowledge.
But for the apostles and first-century Jewish and pagan people, they are discovering the fact that Jesus is actually divine.
Mountain:
The first item to analyze is the “Mountain” Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain. As we have been studying the OT we know that the Mountains are symbolic for God experiences – Moses goes up the mountain to encounter the Lord face to face (although he does not see God face to face, but was able to see the glory of God as God passed by) Also Mount Zion is the place where they went up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple built by King Solomon.
When Jesus took them up the Mountain, they would have known that there is going to be a God experience – a “Theophany”.
Moses & Elijah:
Now, wait a minute what are they doing here in the NT. We know that Moses is dead and Elijah was taken up into heaven. The thing that is common between the two is they both went up a mountain to meet God, they had a Theophany. Moses represents the Law and Elijah represents the Prophets. We know that both Moses and Elijah had to hide their face in the OT – Moses saw the back for God and Elijah hide his face when he recognized God in the wind, but now we see them “talking” to Jesus. They were unable to see the glory of God, but now Jesus bridges the gap and we human beings can speak to God.
Bright Clothing, Voice, and Cloud:
Jesus’ “garments” became “glistening” or intensely white. This is symbolic that He is divine, this was the way heavenly creatures were represented. Jesus gives the apostle a glimpse of the hidden glory hidden under his human flesh. We also hear the voice of God – affirming that Jesus is God.
“This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”. The cloud mentioned here represents the presence of God, just as it used to come down in the temple/tabernacle/ holy of holies – and everyone was in awe and could not even enter the temple. Similar to the experience that Mary had when the Holy Spirit overshadowed her at the annunciation. Looks like Peter James and John experienced this Theophany - an encounter with God, where Jesus is revealed to them as God, a God that we can talk to.
Booths
Peter made an interesting recommendation to build 3 booths. What he seems to be referring to here is the feast of the booths. We have read about it in Exodus where they would make tents/booths/tabernacles and stay in them, feasting on the fruit of the harvest – as an icon of the resurrection. Peter is carried away and thinks it's already Resurrection.
Hope this helps us enrich our experience of the Transfiguration. May we have a Theophany experience the next time we go to adoration.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏

Mark 9:5 & 9
Peter was ecstatic for a short while, when he saw the glorious heavenly scene, but eventually he had to leave the place and go down the mountain.

Sometimes when we experience small miracles in our lives or when we are engaged in prayer and meditation with the Lord in solitude and silence, we may feel so ecstatic that we don't want that moment to end but the reality is that we are still in this world and we will have to face challenges often.

Mark 9:28-29
\*When he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”  He said to them, “This kind can come out only through prayer and fasting.”\*

Prayer is a radical acceptance of our dependence on God.
Fasting is not observed to experience hunger or to punish ourselves by starving our bodies.
Fasting is observed to remind us that our existence and sustenance is dependent on God, and not on the material food which we eat (Deut. 8:3).

An exorcist priest must be in a state of grace, with prayer and fasting included, before performing an exorcism because the devil knows exactly who is in a Covenant with God and who is not, otherwise it can be very dangerous for the priest while performing the exorcism (Acts 19:13-16).

Mark 9:37
\*Whoever receives one child like this in my name, receives me.\*
When Christians bring forth children as a gift from God, they receive Jesus into their Christian homes.  When they refuse to bring forth children they are refusing Jesus.

Mark 9:38-39
\*John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”\*

The seventy elders who received God’s Spirit through Moses were a shadow of the ministry of the Apostles (Numbers 11:16-17).
Like Joshua (Numbers 11:25–29), John too made the mistake of presuming that only a select few are inspired and entrusted to carry out God’s plans.
The disciples exhibited a worldly sense of competition regarding the spiritual ministry of exorcism.
They wanted their power to be exclusively for themselves and they wanted to be the exclusive channel of God’s grace.

The Spirit blows where it wills (John 3:8), and God desires to bestow His Spirit on all His people in every nation under Heaven (Acts 2:5, 38).
God can, and will, work mighty deeds through the most unexpected and unlikely people. All of us are called to perform even our most humble tasks, such as giving a cup of water, for the sake of the Lord’s name and the cause of His kingdom.

Often, like Joshua and John, perhaps without noticing it, we cloak our failings and fears under the guise of our desire to defend Christ or the Church.
But as Jesus says, instead of worrying about who is a real Christian and who is not, we should make sure that we ourselves are leading lives worthy of our calling as disciples (Ephesians 1:4).
We need to keep meditating on God’s Law. We need to pray for the grace to detect our failings and to overcome them.

Mark 10:2-12
Why did Jesus forbid divorce and re-marriage?
A Christian marriage is a sacrament because it is a union between two baptized persons.  Marriage is a Covenant relation, and Covenants are lifetime spiritual bonds.

In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church (Ephesians 5:23-24).
The Church is the bride of Christ and was created to be with Jesus forever just as woman was created to be with her spouse for lifetime.  Therefore, God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16).

In the old Covenant, divorce and remarriage (Deut. 24:1-3 or 4) were permissible because the old Covenant Temple was only a temporary symbol of the Body of Christ.  The new Covenant Church (the Christians) is the true bride of Christ and just as Jesus and His bride (the Church) are inseparable, so also man and wife must never divorce.  When a Christian couple divorce they break the sacred bond.

What God has put together, no one can separate (Mark 10:9), therefore divorce does not erase the lifetime marriage Covenant vows.  Thus, divorcing our spouse and marrying another is considered as adultery because, by the marriage Covenant vows, we are joined to our first spouse until death separates us.

Jesus reminded the people that divorce was never in God's plan for humanity from the beginning.  Jesus therefore forbade divorce (Mark 10:9), and if a couple must separate due to unavoidable circumstances, it is NOT a permission for them to re-marry (Mark 10:11-12; 1 Corinthians 7:10-11).

Jesus revealed that marriage is a divine, life-giving sign. Through the union of man and wife, God intended to bestow His blessings on the human family, making it fruitful, multiplying it until it filled the earth (Genesis 1:28).
