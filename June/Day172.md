### BIAY Day 172 By Cynthia Dsilva

Psalm 72:9

\*May his foes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.\*

Bowing down and licking the dust was a form of punishment for the enemy just as the enemy was punished in the beginning by God’s lowering the enemy’s status and making him lick the dust (Genesis 3:14).

Bowing down and licking the dust was very humiliating for the enemy.

### Day #172 For when I am weak, then I am strong

Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done. He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success. 2 Cron 26: 3,5
Everything was going great with Uzziah as he was following the mentoring of Zechariah and sought the Lord before he did anything. God gave him success and he was doing great as a King, won battles and his fame was spreading become he was becoming very powerful. He had everything a good successful king should, armies, fertile lands, weapons, towers…
But, the big But was he become powerful and proud.
But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. 2 Cron 26: 16
When he was young and weak he sought God for everything, but as he grew powerful he wanted to take matters into his own hands. Even despised God’s commandments and took the place of the Levitical priest- by burning incense.
We see that he was struck by leprosy on the forehead- almost instantly and it lasted till the day he died.
One thing we can learn is to be humble and rely on God always. Even if we get wiser, richer stronger, we should not rely on our own merits but trust in the Lord. Sometimes I feel it’s better for us to stay weak and in need of God, lest we forget God.
Just like St Paul we don’t like to offend the Lord with our sin, ask the Lord to take away the thorn from our flesh/(sins or weakness or limitation) God may give us the strength to overcome it, or else may reply as He did to St Paul “My grace is sufficient for you, power is made perfect in weakness”
To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Cor 12: 71-10
Let us not be too puffed up when people say good things about us or when we become stronger in our faith, lest we fall into the sin of Pride. Let us be humble and accept our weakness knowing that when we are weak then we are strong because we rely on God’s grace and not on our own strengths.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
