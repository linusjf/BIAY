### BIAY Day 172 By Cynthia Dsilva

Psalm 72:9

\*May his foes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.\*

Bowing down and licking the dust was a form of punishment for the enemy just as the enemy was punished in the beginning by Godâ€™s lowering the enemyâ€™s status and making him lick the dust (Genesis 3:14).

Bowing down and licking the dust was very humiliating for the enemy.
