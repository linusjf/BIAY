### Day #164 People turn to God when everything else fails.

At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, and Jeroboam said to his wife, ‚ÄúGo, disguise yourself, so you won‚Äôt be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there‚Äîthe one who told me I would be king over this people.
Why would he ask his wife to disguise herself, one reason would be because King Jeroboam was not in good standing with the prophets or God. He is the King in the North that built idols and ordained fake priests just so that people would not go to the south to worship in Jerusalem.
But when it came to his own son Abijah he wanted to somehow have the Lord heal him. He tried a crooked way to get God‚Äôs blessing, it didn‚Äôt work. Remember last time the prophet was torn apart by the Lion because he ate with this King.
One cannot dodge God, God is all-knowing.
This is the case with many of the people in the world today. They want to live as they want and indulge in worldly pleasure and comforts. When they get sick or have problems, they turn to medicine, counseling, meditation, and therapy(not that any of those are wrong - they should be treated as instruments the Lord uses to heal us - these become a problem when they become an end in its own).
When everything else fails they want the Lord to heal them, they would come in disguise only with the intention to be healed, visit every prayer center, and holy place, ask everyone to pray and once they receive the healing they are back in the world. We see the bad fate of Jeroboam, his wife, and the sick son even dies.
Let us not be like Jeroboam, but seek the Lord earnestly with all our hearts, minds, and body. We should always pray and have a relationship with God, in good and bad times. We should not be part-time servers, but lifelong disciples of the Lord, who follow Him as he leads us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
