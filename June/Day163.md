### Day #163 In love with God

Many people complain that religion is boring, and praying is more like a chore. This is a genuine experience for those who are not experiencing a love relationship with the Lord. Our God is not a distant God who gave us the 10 commandments and said ‚Äì ‚ÄúOk now follow them or else you‚Äôre going to hell‚Äù.
The Song of Solomon/Songs gives us a poetic picture of how God loves us and pursues us. He is like a lover seeking out his love and calling her and seeking after her. It‚Äôs compared to nature in springtime, how the dove seeks out its mate. The male birds are more beautiful than the female and they sport colorful feathers, dance, and make sounds to impress the females. The dove finds a mate and becomes a bonded pair ‚Äì raising chicks and only focused on their lives. In the same way, our lover Jesus goes after the lost sheep and seeks it out, once He finds it will dust off the dirt and carry it back on his shoulders.
Our God is not distant but is always with us, even until the end of the age. He knows everything about us when we sit down when we rise up when we come and go out.
Even before a word is on our lips, he already knows it. He cares for us and comforts us when we are in distress.
We are called to love him back and seek after Him with all our heart, mind, and soul. Our prayers and practices should be works of passion and with great love for the Lord.
‚Äúlet me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.‚Äù SOS 2:14
We need to seek Jesus' face, more than his hands. We need to bring prayers of praise and worship before we pray prayers of petition. Let us seek Jesus' beautiful face in the Eucharist as we receive it and fall deeply in love with him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 163: By Sheila

In the Book of Kings, the Prophet who spoke to Kings, went to the pagan altar where King Jeroboam led in worship of false gods. He prophesied that a King from the lineage of David would come to cleanse the altar of its pagan sacrifices. This prophecy was fulfilled by King Josiah nearly three Centuries later.
In Chronicles, Rehoboam forsook the Law of the Lord and suffered defeat and lost the cities he had built. It was the end of Rehoboam's Reign.
Abijah became King, he cried out to the Lord. His faithfulness to the Lord, got him victory. The Mother of Abijah was the beloved wife if King Rehoboam. She was the daughter of Tamar, grand-daughter of Absalom and she worshipped idols.
The Covenant of Salt describes the effective and permanent Character of God's Covenant with David because salt is used as a preservative and enhance flavor.
In the Song if Songs, God's love is manifested. He is calling, pursuers us, cares and comforts all.
Nothing can seperate us from God's Love. Foxes that spoil the vines is a reference found in any intimate relationship. A marriage is a commitment to work through such difficulties and protect relationship.
