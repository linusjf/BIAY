### Day #177 I will heal their faithlessness

As we complete the book of prophet Hosea we are left with a sense of our faithlessness and God’s faithfulness. God did everything well for us, just as Hosea did, but we like his harlot wife have left the Lord and his goodness for the temporary pleasures of the earth.
He formed us in our mother’s womb, brought us out safely into this world, even taught us to walk, healed us when we were sick, and provided for us our whole life, he lead us with cords of compassion and with bands of love.
Yet it was I who taught E′phraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of compassion with the bands of love, Hos 11:3,4
However, we gave in to the temptations of this world and chose sin over Christ. We even committed these sins over and over again. We even lost our identity of being God’s children, maybe we shaped our lives based on world principles or maybe we do not even have a good relationship with God or a strained relationship. Do not worry if you find yourself in this state, our God will heal our faithlessness and love us freely even though we have failed him. He will always love us and come after us with great love and compassion. Let us be found by Him.
I will heal their faithlessness; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them. I will be as the dew to Israel; Hos 14:4,5
Let those who have ears listen and open their hearts to our compassionate God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 177 By Cynthia Dsilva

Hosea 11:1

\*Out of Egypt I called my son.\*

Literally, God was referring to the old Israel as His son.
Israel was redeemed from idolatry and physical bondage under the Pharaoh in Egypt.

Prophetically, God was referring to Jesus, the new Israel (Matthew 2:15) and us.

Jesus was brought home to Nazareth from Egypt after the death of King Herod.

God wants each one of us, His children, to come out of our Egypt (spiritual bondage due to attachment to the world) and come home to Him (surrender).
