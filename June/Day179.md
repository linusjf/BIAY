### Day #179 Glad to go to the house of the Lord or lazy on the couch???

We read this beautiful Psalm today where the Psalmist sets the tone of joy when it comes to going to church. We can imagine the pilgrims in ancient Israel braving the elements of nature - climbing up that mount of Zion -singing this song of Joy, ‚ÄúI was glad when the said to me let us go to the house of the Lord. ‚Äù
I rejoiced with those who said to me, ‚ÄúLet us go to the house of the Lord.‚Äù Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem. Ps 122
I pray and hope that everyone reading this has the joy and the fire in your hearts when you think of going to Mass. Where we meet the creator of the world, Emmanuel God with us, the living bread that comes into our hearts.
That being said, I‚Äôm sure we have felt lazy to go to church sometimes, or we know those who just don‚Äôt want to get up from the couch and get to church. Those who want to sleep in on Sunday or just go for a walk or go eat a heavy brunch instead of church.
Let Prophet Amos talk to us today to help us shed some of the slack and laziness.
You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Amos 6:4-5
Prophet Amos seems to be preaching to our generation, where there is an over-emphasis on luxury and comfort. We see people choosing comfort, pleasure, experiences, sports, parties, food, holidays, fine dining, vacations over God, prayer, and Church. Heaven is a place where there will be constant worship of God, angels and saints will sing Alleluia forever. Our journey on earth is supposed to prepare us to go to heaven, we need to be a people of praise, people who love God, and church on earth because Mass is where God is truly present - Heaven on earth. If we are unable to love God on earth, heaven may not be what we actually want. Of course, God wants us to have good lives with good housing and time for rest, with feasts where we can cherish the heart with good wine and good company, BUT we need to put God first and take joy in the sabbath first. Jesus was found at wedding banquets and at parties, there was always food associated with many things Jesus did. He is not a spoiled sport; Jesus wants us to have our priorities right. We need to have joy every Sunday morning when we go to Mass. This needs to be our song ‚ÄúI was glad when they said to me let us go to the house of the Lord‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 179 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 11:1-20
In the Old Covenant, baby Joash was hidden from a cruel ruler (Queen Athaliah), rescued by an elder (his aunt) and later brought to surface few years later.
But this story is not new.

Some centuries earlier baby Moses too had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (the Pharaoh), was rescued by an elder (his mother) and came to surface few years later.

In the New Covenant, some centuries later, baby Jesus too would be faced with a similar situation.  He had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (King Herod), rescued by the elders (His parents) and came to surface few years later.

But the story does not end here.  Those were only shadows of the perennial condition of all Christians who are part of the mystical Body of Christ (the Church) by participation in the Holy Eucharist.

Some years later, the infant Church (the mystical Body of Christ) had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (Emperor Nero), due to severe persecution, rescued by the elders (the bishops of the Church) and brought to surface few centuries later.  During this time the bishops and priests continued breaking bread (celebrating Mass) and administering the other sacraments to the congregation in secret places (private homes and underground cellars) to ensure that the Christians would be allowed to practice their faith and would not be deprived of the sacraments.
The Apostles never got a chance to break bread (celebrate Mass) in a separate Church building specially designated for that purpose.

God the Father gave us the guarantee of His divine assistance to protect the Church from the beginning (Genesis 3:15) and Jesus has given us the guarantee of His divine assistance to protect the Church to the end (Matthew 16:18).  Therefore, God the Father took personal care to protect the shadows (Moses, Joash, the Temple, etc.) and the physical Body of Christ, His infant Son, when threatened by evil forces, and Jesus will take personal care to ensure that the Church (His mystical Body / His bride) will never be destroyed by evil forces.

The Church finally came to surface only in the fourth century after Christianity was officially recognized by Emperor Constantine and Christians were allowed to freely practice their faith.

The Church may not be in its infant stage now, but Christians can become targets of persecution any time in their lives due to hostile anti-Christian people.  We must therefore be prepared for eternal life every day of our lives.

2 Kings 12:6-7

\*But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had made no repairs on the the House (of God) / the Temple.  Therefore King Jehoash summoned the priest Jehoiada with the other priests and said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you not repairing the House (the Temple)?\*

Christ our King is asking us the same question, ‚ÄúWhy are you not repairing the temple of the Holy Spirit (your body)?‚Äù
Have we repaired it by confessing our sins?
If not, then let us examine our conscience so that we can go to the priest and attend to the repairs soonest.

Amos 6:1-7
Amos lamented over the fate of the rich and powerful who are destined for exile, not because of their wealth but because of their refusal to share it with the less fortunate ones, and not for their power but for their indifference to the suffering at their door.
The complacent leaders feasted on fine foods and wines, and revelled while the house of Joseph, the kingdom of Israel, was collapsing around them.

Born to the nation which God favored first, they could claim Abraham as their father, but because of their failure to give to the poor, their inheritance would be taken away.
In this world, the rich and powerful make a name for themselves (Genesis 11:4) and dine sumptuously, while the poor and needy continue to be neglected.

What about us?
Have we provided at least one poor family or person with one meal every day?
Have we sponsored at least one poor child‚Äôs education?
Do we give generously to the Church?
During the Penitential Rite of every Mass we ask the Lord to forgive us for the wrong that we have done and for the good which we have failed to do.
Have we tried to correct the wrong that we have done?
Have we tried to make up for the good which we have failed to do?

Let us check ourselves.   If we haven‚Äôt done anything yet, we can still begin today.
Let us not live selfishly for ourselves and for our own nuclear families.
Let us correct our errors and start making up for the good which we have failed to do.
There are many ways to help the poor and needy.  If we ask the Lord He will lead us to many needy ones.

Psalm 122:3-5

\*Jerusalem, built as a city, that is bound firmly together with a wall around it.\*
\*There the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.\*
\*There are the thrones of justice, the thrones of the house of David.\*

The Davidic princes sat on thrones to judge cases in the event of violation of God‚Äôs Law.
Like their father, David‚Äôs sons were also heirs to Melchizedek‚Äôs Jerusalem kingship as well to Melchizedek‚Äôs priesthood (2 Sam. 8:18).

David and his successors were shadows of Jesus, the royal High Priest and Judge.
In the new Covenant, the bishops (the royal priests and representatives of Christ) sit on thrones in their dioceses to judge their congregations in the event of violation of God‚Äôs Law.
