### Day #179 Glad to go to the house of the Lord or lazy on the couch???

We read this beautiful Psalm today where the Psalmist sets the tone of joy when it comes to going to church. We can imagine the pilgrims in ancient Israel braving the elements of nature - climbing up that mount of Zion -singing this song of Joy, ‚ÄúI was glad when the said to me let us go to the house of the Lord. ‚Äù
I rejoiced with those who said to me, ‚ÄúLet us go to the house of the Lord.‚Äù Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem. Ps 122
I pray and hope that everyone reading this has the joy and the fire in your hearts when you think of going to Mass. Where we meet the creator of the world, Emmanuel God with us, the living bread that comes into our hearts.
That being said, I‚Äôm sure we have felt lazy to go to church sometimes, or we know those who just don‚Äôt want to get up from the couch and get to church. Those who want to sleep in on Sunday or just go for a walk or go eat a heavy brunch instead of church.
Let Prophet Amos talk to us today to help us shed some of the slack and laziness.
You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Amos 6:4-5
Prophet Amos seems to be preaching to our generation, where there is an over-emphasis on luxury and comfort. We see people choosing comfort, pleasure, experiences, sports, parties, food, holidays, fine dining, vacations over God, prayer, and Church. Heaven is a place where there will be constant worship of God, angels and saints will sing Alleluia forever. Our journey on earth is supposed to prepare us to go to heaven, we need to be a people of praise, people who love God, and church on earth because Mass is where God is truly present - Heaven on earth. If we are unable to love God on earth, heaven may not be what we actually want. Of course, God wants us to have good lives with good housing and time for rest, with feasts where we can cherish the heart with good wine and good company, BUT we need to put God first and take joy in the sabbath first. Jesus was found at wedding banquets and at parties, there was always food associated with many things Jesus did. He is not a spoiled sport; Jesus wants us to have our priorities right. We need to have joy every Sunday morning when we go to Mass. This needs to be our song ‚ÄúI was glad when they said to me let us go to the house of the Lord‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
