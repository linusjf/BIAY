### BIAY Day 167 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 19:1-8
Elijah was re-living the experiences of Moses and his people in the old Covenant, as a shadow to be fulfilled by Christ and his people in the new Covenant.

1.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah saved himself from the cruel queen and took refuge at Mount Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God, just as Moses saved his people from the cruel king and took refuge at Mount Sinai/Horeb, the mountain of God.

1.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus saved us from Satan and gave us refuge in the Temple of God (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) which He offered up to God on Mount Zion.

2.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah and Moses spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

2.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

3.a) In the old Covenant, God fed Elijah in the desert with miraculous bread & water to strengthen him on his physical journey just as God fed Moses & his people in the desert with miraculous bread (Manna) & water to strengthen them on their physical journey.

3.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus gives us the miraculous water of Baptism and feeds us with the miraculous Bread of life (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) to strengthen us on our spiritual journey.

1 Kings 19:11-13
God did not speak to Elijah when there was noise and chaos around.  God spoke to him only when there was silence.  The strong wind, earthquake and fire were only to announce the arrival of an important person just as we use bugles, trumpets and drums for the same reason.

God does not speak to us when our lives are filled with noise and chaos.  That is why it is important to sit alone in silence, for a few moments every day, and speak to the Lord so that we can build a personal relationship with Him, just as we build a personal relationship with our family and friends by talking to them.

Let us therefore try to avoid filling our lives with secular music and too much carousing.

### Day #167 The sound of sheer silence

We read about the 'God encounter' of Elijah on the mountain. The angel told Elijah to stand on the mountain and wait for the Lord.
Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; 12 and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. 13 When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 1 Kings 17:11-13
Elijah would have anticipated that the Might God, creator of the world would come with great splendor, with thunder, fire, smoke, and lightning. He looked for God in the wind, the earthquake, the fire, but when he heard the sound of sheer silence, he wrapped his face and went out of the cave and stood at the entrance, then there was a voice that spoke to him.
It's the same with us, our lives are so full of noise and busy schedules that we are unable to calm down to hear God’s voice. We seem to be preoccupied with so many things, planning for the future and sometimes dwelling too much on the past, that we do not create space for the Lord to speak to us. We are running from pillar to post and don’t have time for the Lord. We need to allocate quiet time with the Lord, where we can have a heart-to-heart conversation with Jesus. Let’s put Jesus on our schedule, maybe an hour of adoration once a week. Don’t get me wrong, we can hear God talk to us anytime, however it is clearer when we quiet our hearts and pay full attention. When Elijah heard the sound of silence – it was his "Theophany" moment when he realizes that he was in the presence of God Almighty. The “sound of silence” is one of those sounds where you know that it’s an out-of-this-world experience, you just know – it’s hard to explain what the presence of the Lord feels like.
The Psalmist invites us to “this still” state.
He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; Ps 46:10
Jesus constantly took his disciples away from the crowd to a quiet place
Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.” Mark 6:31
Jesus himself went away from the crowds and the disciples to pray. Jesus would send the disciples away and have personal time with Abba Father and usually woke up before everyone to pray.
And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed. (Mark 1:35)
Let us also make this a habit, let us have a quiet time and space to pray. A time for some sacred silence and meditation. Let us follow Jesus's instruction to go inside your room and pray.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
Once we heard the voice of God, we will always be able to tune ourselves to the small still voice that tells us right from wrong. Many of us already know that still small voice that comes from within, telling us right from wrong.
This song really helps me when I try to enter into that sacred place with the Lord.
May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏
