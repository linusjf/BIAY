### Day #180 Relics of saints ‚Äì Elisha‚Äôs bones brought a man to life

We know that Elisha received a double portion of the anointing of the spirit of Elijah. He did many miracles while he was alive. He does this incredible Miracle after he is dead.
So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year. As a man was being buried, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha; as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life and stood on his feet. 2 Kings 13:20,21
What a Miracle, just try to picture it, a dead man was thrown into Elisha‚Äôs grave, and he comes to life and stands up. Wow!! This is a prefiguration of Jesus raising Lazarus to life and also a pre-figuration of everyone‚Äôs rising from the dead.
Catholics get a lot of pushback about saints and their relics and even get called out as idol worship. The main objection is why are you Catholics talking to dead people or praying to their dead bones. Here is a good reference smack right in scripture where the bones of Elisha brought a man to life. Although not everything has to be in the Bible, Jesus gave us a church and not a book. In fact, the Bible was compiled and arranged by the Catholic Church ‚Äì through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. But for those who only believe if it is in the bible ‚Äì here it is.
So when Catholics pray and touch a holy relic of the saints, they are invoking the prayers of the saint. One would argue, why pray to dead people why not pray straight to God. First of all, they are alive and not dead, they were holy people and are now with the Lord. Their prayers are very powerful ‚Äì because the prayer of the righteous person is powerful (Gal 5:16).
Before anyone is declared a saint there need to be 3 Miracles received through their intercession which are scientifically/medically unexplainable.
Try to find relics of Saints ‚Äì either first hand or second hand and pray and touch them, it has brought healing to many.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 180 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 13:19
*And the man of God (Elisha) was angry with King Joash, and said, ‚ÄúYou should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it.  But now you will strike Syria only three times.‚Äù*

When Elisha was suffering from the sickness of which he was to die, King Joash came to Elisha to receive his dying counsel and blessing.

But why was Elisha angry?
Joash saw the power of God at work through Elisha.  He may have thought that once Elisha dies, his power will be gone with him.  He was afraid of losing his kingdom because he had few chariots and horsemen and therefore cried out to Elisha for help.
Elisha gave him instructions and Joash followed them, though not exactly, but out of fear and not with faith.
This is what angered Elisha.

In the midst of his despair, God had given King Joash the opportunity of his lifetime, to terminate the Syrians once and for all.
Elisha gave specific instructions regarding what Joash was to do.
Joash was to take a bow and some arrows and shoot the arrow out from the East window.  The power of God would be released through that act in obedience.
Then Elisha gave him a second set of instructions; to take the arrows and strike the ground.

But the king struck the ground only 3 times and stopped.
Joash may have not believed that the enemy could be destroyed by striking the ground with arrows several times.  Moreover, his pride may have stood in the way.  After all, he was the king.  Why was he asked to strike the ground with arrows instead of increasing his chariots and horsemen to outnumber his enemy?

His lack of zeal and faith resulted in his receiving much less than what God had desired to give him.  God was willing and powerful enough to remove Israel‚Äôs enemy for good, if only the King had obeyed God‚Äôs Word and done exactly what he was asked to do.

Sometimes we too make the same mistake of focusing on our problems and calculating the solutions with our human mind instead of believing in God‚Äôs Word because God‚Äôs ways are mostly strange and impossible.
Our God is able to do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine but it has to be done His way, not our way.

Amos 8:5-6
*‚ÄúWhen will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the Sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale?  We will reduce the size of the containers for measuring, add to the weights and fix our scales to practice deceit with false balances; we will buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and even the sweepings of the wheat we will sell.‚Äù*

God had commanded that no work must be done on the Sabbath and new moon days (Leviticus 23:24; Exodus 20:8) because those days must be dedicated to Him with praise, worship, prayers, good work, etc., so that His people could build a spiritual relationship with Him.  If the people remained busy with their material lives on the Sabbath and new moon days also, then they would be too exhausted to build a relationship with God.

But the merchants despised the new moons and Sabbaths, the holy days of God, because they were more concerned about the prosperity of their material life and not their spiritual life.

Being slaves of mammon (wealth), in their desire to acquire wealth they reduced the poor people to objects.

Many of us, too, are like those merchants. When our earthly employer gives us a day off to spend with our families, which is a blessing from God, we are very happy, but when our heavenly Father says to relax and dedicate that same day to Him along with our families, with praise, worship, prayers, good work, etc., we have a lot of excuses and complaints.

Our sinful nature causes us to take the gifts and blessings *from God* but when we have to use the same gifts and blessings *for God* we look at them as burdens.
God's Law is given to us for our spiritual benefit which will bring us eternal happiness, but like those merchants, we too are more focused on our material life and not on our spiritual life.

God wants us to focus on helping the poor, the needy and the less fortunate ones around us, but those merchants were boldly cheating the poor unsuspecting people and using their wealth to buy the less fortunate ones as if they were commodities to be purchased.
Let us not ignore the less fortunate ones around us.  Let us not live selfishly for ourselves like those merchants.
