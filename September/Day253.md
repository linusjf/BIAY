### Day #253 Let our lamentations be prayers to Christ.

As we read the book of lamentations, we can only imagine the suffering that Baruch experienced. It is not just statements of the bad situations but it‚Äôs more like prayers rising up to God.

‚ÄúSee, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. ‚Äù Lam 1:20

When you see your children in need of something and we cannot do anything to help them, it breaks every parent's heart. The children of Israel are destitute and there is no one who can comfort them.

‚ÄúThis is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.‚Äù
Our usual response when we go through suffering is ‚Äúwhy me Lord‚Äù or "What did I do wrong" or we end up focused on the suffering and say "Earlier It was much better", "I was able to do this/that" or "I should not have done this or that" .

Suffering on earth is inevitable and everyone will go through various suffering on earth. We have to train ourselves to accept suffering, to voice our prayers to the Lord, to be able to lament and offer up our sufferings for the salvation of souls. We should not only focus on the why of things or how to get out of suffering, but we have to be able to live in suffering and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort us when we go through difficult times.

Difficult times make us stronger, and the Lord is always with us. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, so don‚Äôt hesitate to lament and talk to the Lord about those hard things you are facing.

Ps 34: 18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
We should unite our suffering to the suffering of Christ, for the salvation of the world.
12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 1 Pet 4: 12-13

We should not be surprised that we have suffering in our lives, we should rejoice that we are able to participate in the sufferings of Christ. Even if the suffering seems like a lot, we need to remember that the Lord will not permit anything we cannot handle, and there will always be a way out. So let us accept our sufferings, lament and pray, and be united to Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
