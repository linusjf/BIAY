### Day #270 Two ways to trust in the Lord.

We see two different approaches that Nehemiah and Ezra take to prayer and trusting in God. Both of them had a similar situation ‚Äì they needed to journey and in the days of Kings ‚Äì one would need a small band of armed soldiers to safely travel. The two took two different approaches ‚Äì Ezra was ashamed to ask the King for protection because he said that the Lord God will protect him.

21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might deny ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions. 2
2 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and his wrath are against all who forsake him. 23 So we fasted and petitioned our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty. Ez 8:21-23

Nehemiah goes the route of praying that the King will send a cavalry with him and it did happen, the King granted his request.

4 Then the king said to me, ‚ÄúWhat do you request?‚Äù So I prayed to the God of heaven. 5 Then I said to the king, ‚ÄúIf it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors‚Äô graves, so that I may rebuild it.‚Äù 6 The king said to me (the queen also was sitting beside him), ‚ÄúHow long will you be gone, and when will you return?‚Äù So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a date. 7 Then I said to the king, ‚ÄúIf it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may grant me passage until I arrive in Judah; 8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king‚Äôs forest, directing him to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.‚Äù And the king granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me.
9 Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king‚Äôs letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and cavalry with me. Nehemiah 2: 4-9

Sometimes in life, we are faced with a situation where we need to trust the Lord. We can take either route of praying that God Himself will take care of us and we will be safe, or we could pray that God will use people in authority to keep us safe.
For example, some people could have such strong faith that they feel that God will heal them Miraculously and stop taking medicine or don‚Äôt go for surgery.
There is also another kind of people that say that God will heal them with medicines and surgery and they pray that God will guide the hands of the doctor.
Now none of us will ever know what is the right method, but all of us know that we cannot limit the way God works. God can heal us directly with a Miracle and also can use doctors and medicine to heal us.
The important thing to remember is that God is the source of everything good, as long as we trust in him ‚Äì it does not matter what route we take ‚Äì if we ask for an army or if we blindly trust the Lord to protect us.
Our Faithful God will always protect us, we need to be sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to know what route to take.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
