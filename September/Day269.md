### Day 269 Your words and actions only expose what‚Äôs in your heart

Even children make themselves known by their acts, by whether what they do is pure and right. Prov 20:11

This is so simple and so true, our actions reveal who we really are. We sometimes do not know who we really are, we may think we are all good and don‚Äôt need help until we mess up. But God knows us well and still loves us.

Jesus taught that the mouth speaks what the heart is full off.
43 ‚ÄúNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45 The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks. Luke 6:43-45

Sometimes we can put on a mask and try to be good in front of people, but our truth can never be covered up all the time. Usually, the close family knows the true nature of the person. Also, certain circumstances and situates will reveal the person.

If we like to do some self-examination, we can keep track of our words and actions and this will reveal the state of our hearts. We can also keep track of our thoughts and see know what we are thinking all the time. These will help us know who we really are and we can work on our weaknesses.

Sometimes we have a hidden nature, this nature is revealed when we have a certain opportunity or are faced with a certain situation. For example, a husband may have never imagined that he would be physically violent, but when his wife kept fighting with him, he snapped and hit her. This hidden nature is revealed, and he feels ashamed. We store a lot of good and bad memories in our subconscious mind ‚Äì which shape our personality. We sometimes struggle with certain sins because of our past, we may not even remember what happened to us as children ‚Äì but it impacts us. A good inner healing retreat will help.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
