### Day #252 The Queen of Heaven

As we read Jeremiah, the goddess with the title ‚ÄúQueen of Heaven‚Äù comes up a lot. Given the fact that the catholic church gives Mary the title ‚ÄúQueen of heaven‚Äù can be confusing. If you take the title out of context then it can seem confusing. However there are many differences that are very obvious, first Mary is not a goddess she is human. The Queen of heaven spoken about in Jeremiah was an idol, it‚Äôs talking about idol worship.

6 ‚ÄúAs for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 18 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.‚Äù

The Israelites stopped listening to the word of God that Jeremiah spoke and even stopped burning incense to the idol. They are confused that they are in a poor state because they stopped burning incense to the idol. However, the real reason is that they stopped worshiping the true God of Israel.

When it comes to the title of Queen of heaven for Mary, the first thing is she is not a goddess or an idol. She is just a human being chosen by God to partner with God to bring salvation to the world. She is the daughter of Abba father, the spouse of the Holy Spirit and the mother of Jesus. In the Jewish kingdom, the queen was always the mother, because the kings had many wives.

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.

And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus‚Äô dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1

May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are ‚ÄúI am a handmaid of the Lord‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDo as he says, listen to him‚Äù. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Queen of heaven intercede for us as we try to understand scripture.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Jeremiah 43:1-3
*When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, ‚ÄúYou are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‚ÄòDo not go to Egypt to settle there‚Äô; but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.‚Äù*

The Jews did not want to obey God's Word and they were afraid to accuse God's anointed prophet (Jeremiah) directly so they accused Jeremiah's secretary, Baruch, of inciting Jeremiah to give them false messages thus making him a false prophet.  This was the only way they could defend their disobedience to God's Word.  This was a hypocritical defence on their part because earlier they had taken an oath that they would obey the Lord always, irrespective of whether the message was easy or difficult to follow (Jeremiah 42:5-6).

Like those Jews, sometimes we too twist the wrong to make it look like the right so that we can defend our wrongdoings, and thus we make the good ones look like the bad ones.

Jeremiah 43:13
*He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt.*

An obelisk is a tapering stone pillar, typically having a square or rectangular cross section, set up as a monument or landmark.  It was a symbol of the fertility of Egypt.

Jeremiah 44:1-30
A dispute broke out as to why the city of Jerusalem had been defeated in battle (v. 2-3).  One side (Jeremiah) declared that it was punishment from Yahweh (God) for the sinners who had worshipped the false Queen of Heaven; while another side (the Israelites) insisted that military defeat occurred because people had stopped worshipping the Queen of Heaven.
The Queen of Heaven was most probably the false goddess Astarte, because the Mesopotamians worshipped the same goddess by offering baked cakes, but they called her ‚ÄúIshtar.‚Äù

It was the idolatry of the people that brought devastation to the nation and their lives, not the cessation of idolatry.

God wants us to worship Him by following a liturgical pattern, which includes offering to Him incense and baked cakes/wafers and pouring out libations to Him as a perpetual statute until the end of time (Exodus 29:38-42).  The Israelites were following the same liturgical pattern but to worship the false goddess (v.17 & 19).
God is a loving Father and therefore He provides us with our daily needs irrespective of whether we ask Him or not, just as our earthly father would provide for us even if we were unproductive or disobedient.  It is not Satan or the false gods who provide for our survival.

The Israelites connected their earthly pain and gain with the deity they worshipped, but the spiritual reality is opposite.

When we walk on the right path towards God‚Äôs Kingdom, worshipping the living God and obeying all His Commandments, Satan is not happy and therefore he works 24x7 to destroy our souls by destroying our peace and happiness with persecution and/or constant suffering (Revelation 12:17), in and out of our homes, to mislead us into believing that our misfortunes are due to the living God who we worship.  But God allows Satan to create those problems and sufferings in our lives to heal us spiritually.
On the other hand, when we walk on the wrong path Satan is very pleased and therefore he will not create any major crisis in our lives so that we are comfortable and happy.  He may create small problems in our lives to mislead us into believing that those are the crosses which Jesus wants us to carry and we start believing that we are walking on the right path.

If we focus on our earthly peace and happiness, we end up making wrong decisions and moving forward on the wrong path, which is exactly what Satan wants us to do.
The Israelites were making the same mistake.

The people attributed their prosperity to the queen of Heaven when, in reality, it was God who was blessing them with prosperity.

Sometimes we too are like those people.
We attribute our success to our benefactors on earth and we forget that it is God who makes it possible for them to help us prosper.  We go out of our way to give them so much importance that we won't even think twice about cancelling our time with God (Sunday Mass, daily prayers, etc.) to attend to our benefactors and please them.
