### Day#274 Perseverance in opposition

Whenever you try to do something good you will always face opposition, people will say stuff like “No it won’t work”, “you won’t be able to complete it”, “no one will want to do it” ….
The list of negative suggestions or oppositions will never end.

We read about the massive effort among the Jews to build the wall, however, this was met with great opposition.
Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he mocked the Jews. 2 He said in the presence of his associates and of the army of Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish—and burned ones at that?” 3 Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “That stone wall they are building—any fox going up on it would break it down!” Neh 4: 1-3

The Jews were mocked and insulted, and they faced threats and opposition. Imagine someone saying that the wall is so weak that even a fox standing on it will break it down. Don’t we face similar oppositions when we try to do something for the Lord? Usually, the opposition is from people around us and it can really hurt and dampen our spirit.
Nehemiah had the best response to the opposition and to the threats of attack.

So we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night. Neh 4:9

He did two things

1. Pray
2. Guard.

As soon as there was opposition Nehemiah resorted to prayer.
Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their taunt back on their own heads, and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.Neh 4:4
Guard: The workers split into two groups, one group would build the wall while the other group guarded the wall. They would swap duties working day and night until the wall was built. Some even had a sword in one hand and a construction tool in the other.

15 When our enemies heard that their plot was known to us, and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. 16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and body-armor; and the leaders posted themselves behind the whole house of Judah, 17 who were building the wall. The burden bearers carried their loads in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and with the other held a weapon. 18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built.

Let us learn a life lesson here, we can use this two-step approach to face opposition.

1. Pray
2. Guard
   As soon as someone opposes us or ridicules us for our faith or mission, we should pray first. We should never give in to discouragement or despair – we should just pray. The second thing to do is guard ourselves against these negative people. We need not even listen to such negative comments, just walk away or ask them to stop. If we are unable to get away from the opposition just stand your ground and do not give in. Guard the spiritual wall you are building from the enemy, most lies, insults, and mockery are from the devil (the father of lies).
   Let us “Pray” and “Guard” and be strong in the Lord, for our God is fighting for us.
   Pray as though everything depends on God and fight as though everything depends on us(meaning - do our best).
   Let us do our best but know that God will take care of the rest.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
