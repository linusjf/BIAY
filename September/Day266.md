### Day #266 I am with you always until the end of the age

We read about Judas, the man in despair. He did not know what to do when he realized that he handed over an innocent man.

3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 He said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” 5 Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.Mat 27

We see that Judas gave into despair, he could not come to terms with the mistake he made. There was nothing and no one to console him – he took his life.
Now none of us should ever feel like taking our life, because of what Jesus did for us. Jesus paid the price for all our sins, he took away all our distress, and Jesus promises to be with us always I mean “ALWAYS”.
Jesus knows how it feels to be alone and to feel rejected and abandoned.

45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 46 And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
Jesus was crying out to Abba father – “My God my God why have you forsaken me?”
Can you imagine the pain that the Holy Trinity went through – the Father and the Holy Spirit are always united with Jesus. Even though Jesus was united to the Father, Jesus was allowed to experience the feeling of abandonment. The feeling that we feel when people betray us and abandon us. Jesus was allowed to feel the separation of God that we feel when we commit sin.

We have a loving God who knows how it feels when people abandon us. That is why Jesus reminds us that He is with us all the days of our lives.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.Mat 28
Knowing that Jesus is with us we can feel confident about our mission, the mission to tell everyone that we have Jesus. We have the love of God.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Mat 28

May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏
