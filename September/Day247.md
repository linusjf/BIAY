### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 ‚ÄúThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‚ÄòEvery seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.‚Äô Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 ‚ÄúTherefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô for you, declares the Lord‚Äî‚Äòfreedom‚Äô to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ‚ÄúSee, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.‚Äù John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
