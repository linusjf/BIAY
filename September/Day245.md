### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” 5 He answered, “Because I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.”
6 The king said to him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?” 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, “Do not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.”
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, “If you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.” Daniel said to the king, “Let it be done as you have said.”
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, “See, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.” 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king’s signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, “Are the seals unbroken, Daniel?” He answered, “They are unbroken, O king.” 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, “You are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!”
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. “Look at the floor,” he said, “and notice whose footprints these are.” 20 The king said, “I see the footprints of men and women and children.”
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, “You cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.” 25 Daniel said, “I worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.” The king said, “I give you permission.”
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, “See what you have been worshiping!”
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 245 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, “Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.
