### DAY #264 THE NECESSITY FOR WATCHFULNESS

I think one of the most important things in life is to be prepared for Jesus‚Äôs second coming. In our lifetime we will surely meet the Lord either in the second coming or when we die. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful ‚Äì for no one knows the time when the Lord comes.

36 ‚ÄúBut about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, 39 and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. 41 Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. 42 Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.

The day of the Lord will come when people least expect it, there will be two types of people on the day of the Lord. The first kind of people are those who are prepared for Him, and the second type is those who are not prepared. Two women were grinding food, one was taken and one was left back, two were in the field one was taken and one was left back.

Which person would you want to be? I guess you will say that ‚ÄúI want to be the one that was taken, the one that was prepared‚Äù. It‚Äôs simple just follow the two keywords ‚Äì watchful and prayerful.

Just like in the parable of the wedding banquet, the banquet was ready and the people were not prepared for it. Those who were invited did not show up, which lead the servants to go and bring in all the people who were hungry. The people who came to the wedding banquet were not dressed accordingly. They were not prepared for the wedding banquet. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful.

11 ‚ÄúBut when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, 12 and he said to him, ‚ÄòFriend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?‚Äô And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the attendants, ‚ÄòBind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äô 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.‚Äù

The Church provides us with two seasons every year ‚Äì Advent and Lent. Advent and Lent are perfect seasons to prepare "the way of the Lord". Just as every sports team plays different seasons ‚Äì probably yearly. We get to work on our readiness every year, through fasting prayer, and almsgiving we strengthen our resolve to become holy and renew our spiritual lives. May the Lord find us ready when He comes in glory, the best way to be ready is to stay in friendship with Jesus, always stay in the state of grace and be in communion with the church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
