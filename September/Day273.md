### Day #273 Who is my neighbor?

We seem to be stuck with a bunch of names again in Nehemiah although it may seem boring to read them, we need to remember that it was a lot of people doing the work of the Lord. Everyone decided to leave their regular work and they picked up tools to build the wall. The high priest were only supposed to offer sacrifice at the temple, they were dedicated to the service of the Lord. Yet they took up common tools to build the wall, to do the will of the Lord.
Even though we see this massive effort to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem and the whole city was involved. We also read about those nobles who thought that doing a menial task like building a wall was below their dignity.

5 Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord. Nehemiah 3:5

We need to check our hearts and see if we are open to doing anything the Lord may call us to do.
We are called to be servants and not masters, we should be like Jesus ‚Äì who came not to be served but to serve. Let us pray that our hearts be open and willing to do any little thing the Lord asks us to do. We should be open to all tasks for example: cleaning the church floor, visiting people in prison, going out of our way to talk to the person who everyone else ignores.
We may not all be called to be great preachers and evangelists ‚Äì but are certainly called to be a witness at our workplace, home and friend circle. Let us be prepared to do anything the Lord asks of us because most of the time, these small acts of kindness are what bring people to Christ.
We also read how many people were only building the wall in front of their houses and were possibly not concerned for their neighbors or those in need.

28 Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one opposite his own house. 29 After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs. 30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.

We are living in a very ‚ÄúmeWorld‚Äù and everything revolves around my wants and needs. My house, my children, my health, my family, my car, my parish, my group, my, my, my..

Our Christian calling is to live as a community, we should not just think of ourselves all the time, or else we will be like the priest who ignored the traveler in the parable of the good Samaritan.
We will be like those in the final judgment narration who failed to see Christ in the poor, the hungry, and the naked. We will end up asking the question

‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?‚Äô Mat 25:44

We will end up like the rich man who was not able to see the needs of Lazarus the poor beggar who sat hoping to get the crumbs that fell from his table.

Let us not only build the walls near our homes but build the walls of the city of God. Let us not say things like ‚Äì that‚Äôs the work of the clergy or that‚Äôs not my calling or someone else will do it.
Let us be the hands and feet of Christ, let us not hide our light under the bushel basket but set it on a high place for the people to see our light and praise our creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Nehemiah 3:5
*Next to him the Tekoites carried out the work of repair; however, some of their most powerful men (the nobles) would not submit to the labor asked by their masters.*

During the re-building of the Temple the nobles would sit and dish out orders to the poor who were doing all the work, but the nobles themselves did not help with the work.  They considered themselves a class higher than the poor.

The commission to preach the Gospel is for believers of all categories in every age and not only for people who are classified as lower level because in Heaven there is no class distinction.

Jesus Christ, who is God Himself, had every reason to avoid putting on human flesh, yet He humbled Himself in order to be able to taste the various hardships and sufferings of man so that He could bring salvation for men.

We therefore need to step down from our pedestal of pride, humble ourselves and be like Christ.  Spiritual leaders must humble themselves and not feel that they are too big to be involved with the hard work of evangelization or to go out with their teams and bow down to help the poor and needy.

Nehemiah 3:6-32
The construction of the wall of Jerusalem was done through a long and unbroken chain.  Families (large and small) who came from the outskirts as well as from the metropolis of Jerusalem, were involved in doing the whole construction.  It was done through 38 leaders.  Seven villages provided volunteers, and skilled & unskilled workers.  The job was accomplished through a commendable team spirit.  None of the professional workers allowed his/her secular work to hinder the great task of rebuilding the wall, even if it meant losing their jobs.

When God gives us a task He provides workforce, resources, etc. for getting the task accomplished.  But God‚Äôs call to serve Him is not only to a selected few; it is a call to all believers in Christ.  The preaching and spreading of the Gospel is also the responsibility of all believers.  We are all good co-workers with Christ, but when we are committed to expanding the Kingdom of God on earth, *NOTHING* should hinder us from rendering undisturbed service to God.
