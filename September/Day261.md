### Day 261 Is religion boring?

Many people complain that Christianity is boring and has a bunch of rules. We hear phrases like ‚ÄúI tried church, it‚Äôs not for me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get anything out of the sermon today‚Äù.
If one doesn‚Äôt experience anything it mostly is not a problem with the Church or the Bible or God the problem lies in the person. As we read in the parable of the Sower, the "seed" and the "Sower" are always good there is no problem with them. The Sower is very generous with the seed, He is sowing it on all types of soil ‚Äì on the paths, the rocky ground, among thorns, and on good soil.

The problem lies in the soil, in the person itself.
The person does not even listen to the word of God being proclaimed at Church ‚Äì is like the seed sown on the path that the evil one snatched away. When we are distracted or not paying attention at church or while reading God‚Äôs word ‚Äì the evil one is snatching away all the good seed that is being sown.

We may be the type of person who listens to the word and accepts it with joy, however, it does not take root in us ‚Äì we easily forget it and move on to the next thing.

Or we may be the third type of soil that grows the seed into a plant but gets choked as it‚Äôs growing among thorns, thorns are the care and anxieties and troubles of this world that cause us to lose the Word we have received.

So the next time we try to complain about the word of God or the Church we should also examine ourselves ‚Äì to see if we were good soil or we let the evil one snatch the seed away or did not let the word take root or let the cares of this world distract us from the word of God.
Everyone at Mass receives the same Eucharist, yet some turn out to be saints and others, sinners. It's not about what we receive but what we allow Christ to do in us.

As we have dedicated a year to reading God‚Äôs word in this BIAY program, I hope and pray that we are all being good soil for the good seed we receive.

I pray that we produce abundant fruit ‚Äì 30, 60 and a 100 fold fruit and produce.

May we be good soil for the Word of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
