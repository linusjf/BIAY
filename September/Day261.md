### Day 261 Is religion boring?

Many people complain that Christianity is boring and has a bunch of rules. We hear phrases like ‚ÄúI tried church, it‚Äôs not for me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get anything out of the sermon today‚Äù.
If one doesn‚Äôt experience anything it mostly is not a problem with the Church or the Bible or God the problem lies in the person. As we read in the parable of the Sower, the "seed" and the "Sower" are always good there is no problem with them. The Sower is very generous with the seed, He is sowing it on all types of soil ‚Äì on the paths, the rocky ground, among thorns, and on good soil.

The problem lies in the soil, in the person itself.
The person does not even listen to the word of God being proclaimed at Church ‚Äì is like the seed sown on the path that the evil one snatched away. When we are distracted or not paying attention at church or while reading God‚Äôs word ‚Äì the evil one is snatching away all the good seed that is being sown.

We may be the type of person who listens to the word and accepts it with joy, however, it does not take root in us ‚Äì we easily forget it and move on to the next thing.

Or we may be the third type of soil that grows the seed into a plant but gets choked as it‚Äôs growing among thorns, thorns are the care and anxieties and troubles of this world that cause us to lose the Word we have received.

So the next time we try to complain about the word of God or the Church we should also examine ourselves ‚Äì to see if we were good soil or we let the evil one snatch the seed away or did not let the word take root or let the cares of this world distract us from the word of God.
Everyone at Mass receives the same Eucharist, yet some turn out to be saints and others, sinners. It's not about what we receive but what we allow Christ to do in us.

As we have dedicated a year to reading God‚Äôs word in this BIAY program, I hope and pray that we are all being good soil for the good seed we receive.

I pray that we produce abundant fruit ‚Äì 30, 60 and a 100 fold fruit and produce.

May we be good soil for the Word of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 261 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 11:3
*"Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"*

John was the one through whom God had revealed the identity of the Son of God (John 1:34) to the people.  So why was John doubtful now after so many months?
There are three possibilities:

AAA)
John was going to be executed shortly, but his disciples were still following him instead of following Jesus, probably because they were doubtful about Jesus being the promised divine Messiah king.  Therefore, John sent his disciples to Jesus with the question so that Jesus might clear their doubts, as well as our doubts, that Jesus is the Messiah who was to come.

BBB)
Like many of the Jews, John too may have been expecting a royal warrior Messiah who would free them from oppression under the Roman enemy and their allies. The silent healing miracles and peaceful preaching of Jesus, who was living a poor man's life, didn't fit the description of a royal warrior Messiah whom they were expecting.
This is one reason why the Jews, to this day, are still waiting for the promised Messiah.

CCC)
While in prison John had heard of the miracles Jesus was performing.  It was getting close to the time for John's execution and John must have been expecting and hoping that Jesus would come and use His miraculous power to free him (John) from prison;

John was the one who led the people to Christ, but when John himself was in distress and there was no sign of Jesus, John started doubting if Jesus was the God of Israel who was to come as prophesied (Malachi 3:1), and free them from oppression (Malachi 3:5).

When Jesus received the message He only reminded John‚Äôs messengers of the miracles which He (Jesus) had performed.

Sometimes we too can be in the same situation like John (the Baptist).
We may lead people to Christ and assure them that Jesus will be with them during their difficult times.  But when we ourselves are going through distress and we cannot see help coming in the vicinity, then we may tend to get doubtful whether Jesus really has the power to save us from our difficult times and whether we preached correctly about Him.

During such depressing moments Jesus will remind us of all the miracles which He has performed in our lives so that we start counting our blessings, and don‚Äôt focus on the storm which has hit our lives.

Matthew 11:12
*From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent people are taking it by force.*

Jesus was not talking about physical violence in the sense of doing harm.  He was talking about the fact that the people of God must be determined. We must be willing to ‚Äúfight the good fight of faith.‚Äù
Christian life is a constant battle with the evil spirits who are represented by humans on earth.

‚ÄúWe wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers in heavenly places‚Äù (2 Corinthians 10:3-6).

There is no such thing as ‚Äúquietism‚Äù in the Church.
We cannot be passive and make it to Heaven.  We must actively and determinately co-operate with God‚Äôs grace.  We must ‚Äúget violent‚Äù in the Spirit of God, and not by any illicit means.

Matthew 11:18-19
*‚ÄùJohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‚ÄòHe has a demon‚Äô;  the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‚ÄòLook, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!‚Äô‚Äù*

The Pharisees always found some fault with almost all their prophets, including John and Jesus.  They were not satisfied with anyone.

Like those Pharisees, our pride does not allow us to accept any of God‚Äôs anointed ones.  Whichever priest, preacher or spiritual leader God sends to us, we always have some negative comments to make about them.  When they preach, we are busy trying to find some fault in their behaviour or in their preaching, instead of listening to the message which God has sent through them. We don't seem to be satisfied with any of them even though God sends us messengers who are not identical in their character or in their preaching or in their approach. We forget that God's messengers are human like us and therefore not perfect.  We forget that we ourselves are not perfect.

Matthew 11:28-30
*Come to me, all you that labor and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.‚Äù*
Yoke refers to the religious law (1 Kings 12:4 & 14).
The kings of the old Covenant had introduced harsh laws for the people which made it difficult for the people to follow them.
Jesus gave us a simple law "to love God and love our neighbour as ourselves" along with the gift of the Holy Spirit, through the sacraments. The Holy Spirit helps us to follow the new law.  It is the spiritual gift which the old Covenant people did not have and so they struggled manually to obey the law.
When we love one another our sufferings become light.

Matthew 12:8
*The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.*
In the old Covenant, God was the Lord of the Sabbath and only God could change the Sabbath or authorize someone to work on the Sabbath (Leviticus 23:3). By these words Jesus was revealing His identity as God.
Jesus was never against the Sabbath. He never questioned the sacredness of the Sabbath.  He was working towards restoring the purpose of the Sabbath according to the original Will of God at creation.
The elders had covered the spirit of the Law with numerous traditions. Although their intentions were noble, over the centuries, in the process of honoring the Sabbath the spirit of the Law was forgotten.  Jesus was uncovering them and gradually fulfilling the Law by disregarding the man-made traditions which were against God‚Äôs Will.

Matthew 12:14
*The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, to put him to death.*
It is very unusual for the religious authorities to join hands with secular political groups to destroy an enemy.
The Herodians were a group of Jews who were loyal to King Herod, although Herod was not a Jew.  They were normally at war with the Pharisees and Scribes.
But now the Pharisees and Scribes joined together with their enemy (the Herodians) because now they both had a common enemy (Jesus) whom they saw as more powerful than both their groups put together, even though Jesus had no army or weapons.

Matthew 12:29
*How can one enter a strong man‚Äôs house and plunder his property, without first tying up the strong man?  Then indeed the house can be plundered.*
By His sacrifice on the Cross Jesus put Satan on a leash (tied him), and by His resurrection Jesus has given us the sacraments to release all God‚Äôs people who were kept there in bondage in Satan‚Äôs house since the time of Adam.

Matthew 12:32
*Whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this life or in the life to come.*
This statement of Jesus implies that there are some sins that can be forgiven in the next life and some that cannot, which was according to the general belief of the Jews.
Mortal sins cannot be forgiven after physical death but venial sins can and will be forgiven after physical death when the person has completed his/her purification term in Sheol / Purgatory.

Matthew 12:38-42
The Pharisees & Scribes did not ask for a miracle from Jesus because He hadn‚Äôt performed any or because they hadn‚Äôt seen any, and not that they would believe Him if He performed one more.  They were probably looking for entertainment.
Jonah loved his people and was willing to die to save them.
Jesus too loved His people and was willing to die to save them.
Jonah was in the belly of the whale (the earth) (Jonah 2:2 & 6) for 3 days.
Jesus too was in the belly of the earth for 3 days.
After he came out of the whale‚Äôs belly, Jonah went to the evil and adulterous Ninevah with a message from God and Ninevah repented.
After the Resurrection of Jesus, Peter and Paul went to evil and adulterous Rome with a message from God (the Gospel) and many in Rome repented and converted to Christianity.
After Ninevah repented, God used them as an axe to destroy Israel.
After many in Rome repented and converted, Jesus used pagan Rome as an axe to destroy Jerusalem.
The evil and adulterous Jews had asked Jesus for a sign (Matthew 12:38-39) and Jesus promised to give them the sign of Jonah.  Jesus fulfilled His promise 40 years later (in AD 70) when Rome destroyed Jerusalem.

Matthew 12:43-45
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc.  A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are Baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don‚Äôt keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying.  We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Matthew 12:48
And he replied, ‚ÄúWho are my mother and my brothers?‚Äù  And looking at those who sat around him, he said, ‚ÄúHere are my mother and my brothers!  Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.‚Äù
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to bear the Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Matthew 13:24‚Äì30
The weed/darnel grows with the wheat and both look identical. We can only tell the difference when the wheat starts bearing fruit.

The devil is very tricky and evil.  He takes half the truth and twists it. He then tries to prove how it matches with God's Word (Genesis 3:4-5; Luke 4:9-11).  If he succeeds in tricking us, it may sometimes be too late before we realize our errors, after we see the consequences, as in the case of Adam and Eve.  But, like Jesus, if we know our scriptures well, then we will know the difference between good and evil, and between truth and lies, and save ourselves in time.

The line of separation between good and evil, also runs within each one of us.
Do we want to believe the full truth (the wheat) or are we happy to settle for half truth (the weeds/darnel)?

Matthew 13:31-32
The first century Jews, who knew their scriptures well, would have expected Jesus to compare the Kingdom of God (the new Israel) to a cedar of Lebanon, but instead Jesus compared it to a mustard shrub which grows upto 6 to 10 feet in height.
That is because:
A) the Kingdom of God *is glorious* but does not *look glorious* like the kingdoms of this world.
B) the Kingdom of God began with 12 inexperienced members and God empowered them to expand the Kingdom.
C) the size of God‚Äôs Kingdom (the Church) depends on the *number of saints* and not on the *number of people*.
D) the Kingdom of God spreads like the roots of the mustard shrub which spread rapidly and eventually occupy the entire garden where they are planted.

Matthew 13:33
Jesus used examples from creation to teach the people because Israel was an agricultural society and also because God speaks to us and teaches us through His creation.

Preparing bread is one such example.
To prepare bread we must :

1. *crush the grains.*
   This should remind us of the scourging & death of Jesus to form the Church.
2. *then we combine the flour with water.*
   This should remind us of the baptized people meeting together for worship in Church as one family of God.
3. *then we add yeast for the dough to rise.* (Luke 13:21)
   This should remind us to spread the Word of God so that we can bring people to Christ and help the Kingdom of God to grow.
4. *then we bake the bread.*
   This should remind us that together we are one Body in Christ when we celebrate the new Passover (the Mass).
5. *then we consume the bread.*
   This should remind us that when we receive the Bread of Life / Eucharist (Communion) we are all united with Christ in a spiritual marriage.

Matthew 13:52
*And he said to them, ‚ÄúTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.‚Äù*
The kingdom of Heaven cannot be understood unless we understand how the new Testament is hidden in the old and the old Testament is revealed in the new.
In other words, to understand the new Testament we must first understand its Jewish roots.

On one side are the gentiles and on the other side are the Jews and Jesus is the hinge between the two.
