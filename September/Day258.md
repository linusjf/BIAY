### Day 258 St Joseph our model

We have been journeying with the Israelites for what seems like centuries and millions of people. As we read the Genealogy of Jesus we know a few more names because of our ‚ÄúBible in a year‚Äù experience. We also recognize that not everyone in the genealogy of Jesus is perfect, we read their stories, but God is able to draw a straight line with our crooked lives. We recognize that there are women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar who bore a child to her father-in-law (re-read day 20), Ruth (The Non-Jew), and Bathsheba(remarried due to King David‚Äôs sins), the ancestors of Jesus were not perfect people ‚Äì however, the Lord makes all things new in Jesus.
Let us take courage when we find ourselves in sin or have bad ancestors or family. We just need to trust the Lord and do good, He will make all things new.
St Joseph was such a just and humble man, that when he was confronted with the decision to be the guardian of the Savior, he felt unworthy and decided to divorce Mary. He was instructed in a dream that it was indeed God‚Äôs plan for him to be the foster father of Jesus.
St Joseph‚Äôs dream would have been confirmed when baby Jesus received gifts from the wise men, the Gold symbolized his Royal Kingly line. The Frankincense revealed that he would be of priest and offer sacrifices, however, the Myrrh would have been the most difficult to understand and it was used to embalm the dead bodies. However, this was just symbolic of His death and resurrection. It must have been hard being baby Jesus‚Äô parents, that‚Äôs why Mary pondered all these things in her heart.
Joseph became "the savior of the savior" when we had to flee with the Holy Family to Egypt. He protected that family in Egypt and brought them safely back when Herod died. St Joseph is given the title "the terror of demons" because even when he sleeps he communicates with God in dreams.
Let us learn from St Joseph to be humble, discerning, and docile to the will of God. Dream like St Joseph.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 258 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 1:1-17
The genealogy of Jesus has Jews and gentiles which means it needs the unity of Jews and gentiles to birth the complete Body of Christ, the Kingdom of God.
By linking Jesus to Abraham through David, Matthew wants to show his Jewish audience that Jesus is the royal Messiah, the divine Son of the promise.
David is spelt DVD in Hebrew, and the numerical value is 14 ( D=4, V=6).  That is why Matthew has shown the ancestry of Jesus to Joseph in groups of 14.
The Gospel according to Matthew was written for the Jews.

Matthew mentions four women in the genealogy.
All four women were not Jews.  They were either gentiles or associated with gentiles.
Tamar and Rahab were Canaanites, Ruth was a Moabite, the tribe with which God had forbidden the Israelites from intermarrying, and Bathsheba had been married to a Hittite before David.
Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba were not very clean in character.
Tamar‚Äôs two sons were conceived through an illicit relation with Judah;
Rahab was running an establishment of ill repute.
Bathsheba had an adulterous relation with King David.

The people of the Judah tribe were also descendants of these same four women.
Matthew was preparing the Jews to receive a Saviour who was criticized for hanging around with gentiles and sinners because they themselves were the descendants of gentiles and sinful people.  They were also the descendants of illicit relations.
Matthew also shows that Jesus came to redeem not only the Jews but also the gentiles.
Matthew also shows that Jesus was the rightful heir to the Davidic throne as Joseph‚Äôs legal son (Luke 2:21), and Mary‚Äôs biological son (Romans 1:3).

Matthew begins his genealogy from Abraham who was the Father of Judaism

The first century Jews believed that Solomon was the chosen Messiah for Israel.
Therefore, after the Resurrection of Jesus there were conflicts within Jewish families where some Jews in the family accepted Jesus and the others did not.
Matthew, being aware of the situation around him, split the genealogy of Jesus to show the Jews that if Solomon could be accepted as the Messiah even though he was an offspring of an adultrous affair, and a descendant of non-Jewish women, of which two were women of ill repute, and then why couldn't Jesus, who was born of a virgin mother, be accepted as the Messiah?

Matthew 1:20
*‚ÄúJoseph son of David.‚Äù*
Joseph's father was Jacob, not David, but the angel was reminding Joseph of his royal lineage, his dynastic line, because all descendants of David were generally referred to as ‚Äúsons and daughters of David.‚Äù
The angel was reminding Joseph that the Messiah was going to be from the lineage of David, and since Joseph was a descendant of David, he fitted the role as father of the Messiah.

Matthew 1:21
*‚ÄúYou are to name Him Jesus."*
The one who gives the name is the owner or controller of the recipient, just as God named the light ‚Äúday‚Äù and darkness ‚Äúnight‚Äù (Genesis 1:5), the dome ‚Äúsky‚Äù (Genesis 1:8), the dry land ‚Äúearth‚Äù (Genesis 1:10), etc., and just as Adam named all the living creatures (Genesis 2:19-20).
Giving Joseph the authority to name Jesus meant giving Joseph the authority to be the one who controls Jesus, the Son of God, and yet Joseph never misused his authority.

Matthew 1:24-25
*When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; he took her into his home as his wife and he had no marital relations with her until she bore a son.*
Matthew‚Äôs emphasis was on the virgin birth which was according to the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:22-23).  Matthew wrote for a Jewish audience and therefore he wanted to make it known that the baby was purely from the Holy Spirit and not from Joseph.

Accepting a pregnant woman as his wife would bring Joseph a lot of shame and scorn because it would now be believed that he was the man who fathered the child before marriage, which means that Joseph had broken the law.  But Joseph was willing to sacrifice his respect to save Mary.
This is where Jesus learnt about sacrificial love.

*About Joseph.*
Joseph was called a righteous man because he was obedient to the Will of God.  He carried out his duties as a father and a spouse perfectly.
Joseph is mostly painted as an old man because most people find it hard to believe that a young man could remain chaste inspite of being married to a pretty young woman.
If we cannot agree that Joseph was a young man, then we do not know what true sacrificial love is.  That is where Jesus got His values from.
Joseph knew how to master his desires, which is why he is called "righteous."
Joseph reminds us that we can do God's work even when we are working silently in the background.

Matthew 2:12
*Then they returned to their country by another road because God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.*
The magi were experts in interpreting dreams so they knew exactly what the dream meant and how important it was.  Also, they had seen how disturbed Herod was when he heard the news of the new king.

What can we learn from the magi ?

1. They were men who read and believed the Word of God.
2. They started on a journey looking for Jesus.
3. They recognized the kingship and priesthood of the Messiah and therefore presented him with the appropriate gifts, the best of what they had.
4. They humbled themselves to worship Jesus inspite of their high position in society.
5. They obeyed God and not men.
   They were truly wise men.
   The magi were not only seekers, but, most importantly, they were finders.
   They did not stop looking for Jesus until they found Him and the star led the wise men to Jesus.
   Let us become like this special star, and guide many people to Jesus.
   Like the wise men, let us not stop looking for Jesus until we find Him.

Matthew 3:9
*‚ÄúDo not presume to say to yourselves, ‚ÄòWe have Abraham as our ancestor‚Äô; for I tell you, God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.‚Äù*
Our God who is leading His Kingdom on earth (His Church) today, is able to raise priests and missionaries from the stones of the Cathedral / Church.
Some years ago we didn‚Äôt even imagine that the Word of God would be preached through different online platforms, which is now made available to millions of God‚Äôs children.  God gave us the social media well in advance before Covid hit the globe.  God is magnificently guiding the evangelization ministry through social media, creating new opportunities to reach people.
Having the DNA of Abraham is not a guarantee for salvation and neither is Baptism.

Matthew 3:13-17
*Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything. During His baptism Jesus (the sinless man) was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give Him the means by which He could impart to us the Holy Spirit which we were lacking in due to original sin, and He gives the Holy Spirit to us through our Baptism.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.
God always begins a new creation with water and Spirit, a symbol of baptism (Genesis 1:2; Genesis 8:10-11; Exodus 14:22).
Likewise Jesus started the new creation with His baptism.

*And a voice from heaven said, ‚ÄúThis is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.‚Äù*
God is very pleased, not only when Jesus was baptized, but also when any human is baptized.  Baptism is a gift from God, given with love, to make us members of His family and it makes Him very happy whenever a human accepts His gift, just as it makes us happy when someone accepts our gift given with love.

Matthew 4:1-11
Satan tried to tempt Jesus because Satan wanted Jesus to abandon His mission so that humanity would be trapped in sin forever.
If Satan didn't spare the Son of God, then we have no reason to believe that Satan will spare us.

Satan promised to return to Jesus all creation which belongs to Jesus but without suffering.
Satan tempts humanity with this offer of wealth, comfort and pleasure without suffering, even today.

Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly and obey God's Commandments, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us.

Jesus was alone in the wilderness when the devil attacked Him.
The devil's strongest instrument is our isolation from family. He therefore starts by breaking families with divorce, fights for possessions, etc. and then starts working on attacking each soul separately.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.
Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Temptations are God‚Äôs way of training us for spiritual warfare.
A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.
Similarly, we cannot fight the spiritual enemy (Satan) by leading comfortable lives.

To be able to win a physical battle, a soldier of the country has to undergo constant physical training and practice of the use of physical weapons.
Similarly, to be able to win a spiritual battle, a soldier of Christ must undergo constant spiritual training to stay out of sin with daily prayer, reading the Word of God, regular repentance and reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist (Communion), etc. and practice the use of spiritual weapons (peace, love, understanding, patience, humility, kindness, generosity, etc.).

Satan offered 3 shortcuts to Jesus to increase the number of His followers.
*The first shortcut:*
*The tempter came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.‚Äù*
In other words, do whatever you think is right in your eyes; no rules, forget duty, only remember your rights and your desires, etc.

*The second shortcut:*
*Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;*
In other words, humans love excitement and surprises. They love anything that makes them say "vow" even if they forget it after a week.  So perform some magic here and there to keep them entertained and they will follow you.

*The third shortcut:*
*Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, ‚ÄúAll these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.‚Äù*
In other words, Theology is boring. It only talks about suffering. It encourages living in poverty. It tells you not to retaliate when someone insults or humiliates you.  So forget theology and get involved in politics in whichever field you may be, whether in school, at work, in a religious community, or anywhere else, and do whatever it takes to reach the top and have power in your hands, even if you have to hurt some people along the way.

What shortcuts do we take in our lives to increase the number of our likes, followers, viewers and subscribers?

Matthew 4:19
*I will make you fishers of men.*
Why only fishers and not hunters?
Jesus called His first disciples ‚Äúfishers‚Äù because He wanted them to first focus on finding the Israelites who were scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing.  The gentiles/lost tribes, living in the woodlands, would be found later by the ‚Äúhunters‚Äù (Jeremiah 16:16).  After His resurrection Jesus sent Saul/Paul on the mission to bring the gentiles/lost tribes into the Church.
