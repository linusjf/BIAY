### Day #271 Is your marriage making you holier?

The person you marry, can either make you holier or lead you away from the truth. We all know that marriage is the union of two souls, the two are united not just emotionally and physically but also spiritually. Ezra was able to clearly notice how those Israelites with mixed marriages we being led away from the true God. There were several warnings from the Lord and instructions to not marry outside the Israelite community. Not that the others were second class, but the Jews were God’s chosen people, and salvation was going to come from them.

9 After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2 For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way.” 3 When I heard this, I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled. Ezra 9: 1-3

By marrying the other people -the Israelites are slowly taking on idol worship and other practices that are forbidden. They are becoming unclean and committing grave sin.

10 “And now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations. They have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.Ezra 9:10-11

It finally came to the point where Ezra commanded the Israelites to separate from their foreign wives and children. We need to pay attention that this is Ezra’s instruction – not sure if he waited on the Lord for instruction. It was a case-by-case decision – where they determined if the separation was needed.
Of course, God does not like divorce, it is made clear by Jesus’s own words.

8 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”Mat 18:8-9

So the takeaway for us is the question – Is our marriage making us holy or taking us away from God?
God’s design is for marriage to be a small trinity, Husband-Wife-God. Children are a fruit of a good marriage. We should pray for our spouses and help them become the best version of themselves. And if your marriage is abusive or preventing you from following Christ – the Church is always there to guide you and help you with the annulment process.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 271 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 9:5-9
Ezra, in his humility, was counting himself as one among his sinful brothers even though he stayed out of mortal sin.
Like Ezra, we too must refrain from pointing our finger at the sins of others as if to say that we are sinless.

Zechariah 9:9-10
This was an image of a future king who would stop war and bring peace.
It was an image of Jesus whose power comes, not from this world but, from the Father above.  Jesus will bring peace in the world, not by using force or magic, but by spreading love and mercy through His people, the Christians.
