### Day 268 Sloth

What is sloth? Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work. Physical sloth is plain and simple laziness, not wanting to do any work or study or chores. Everyone has some amount of Sloth in them, given a chance – people would live in filth. Laziness is fueled by luxury and comfort, one does not want to get off the couch to get the house tidy. Laziness can result in families facing financial problems.

4The lazy person does not plow in season; harvest comes, and there is nothing to be found. 5 The purposes in the human mind are like deep water, but the intelligent will draw them out. Prov 20:4,5

However bad Physical sloth may be, it’s not as bad as Spiritual sloth. Spiritual Sloth can lead us to Spiritual death. One can go to Mass every Sunday and still not pray, just going through the Mass without praying is disrespectful to Jesus in the Eucharist. Jesus is present Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity in the Eucharist – He looks forward to entering our hearts and soul every time we receive communion.

Sloth is the desire for ease, even at the expense of doing the known will of God. Whatever we do in life requires effort. Everything we do is to be a means of salvation. The slothful person is unwilling to do what God wants because of the effort it takes to do it. Sloth becomes a sin when it slows down and even brings to a halt the energy we must expend in using the means to salvation.

Sloth can prevent us from doing God’s will because we are so lazy and do not want to pray. Some people think that they will be saved by virtue of being baptized. Although we are saved by what Jesus did for us on the cross, we cannot take it for granted and do nothing. We are called to pick up our cross and follow him daily. We are called to work out our salvation with trembling. Not sit and do nothing. We are called to pray and to know the Lord. We are called to be led by the Spirit and not just be dormant.

12 Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.Phil 2

Another form of laziness is being overly busy or preoccupied with many things, that we forget to pray. Sometimes we can be so busy doing God’s work that we even forget our own salvation.
Like those folks who did many things for the Lord but didn’t really do the will of God. To know the will of God we need to have a relationship with God and spend time listening to the Holy Spirits' guidance.

21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ 23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 268 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 4:4-5
*Then the people of the land (the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin) discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build (the Temple).  The adversaries bribed officials to frustrate the plan of the Jews throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.*

The Judah and Benjamin tribes were doing the work of God but the enemies were not happy so they stopped the Jews from re-building the Temple.

Whenever we get busy with God’s work Satan will always stir up his disciples to either stop the work or mess it up.

But the obedience of the Jews had won God’s favour (Ezra 5:5).  The issue was resolved and the work resumed.

As long as we obey God’s commandments He will always send His angels to support us so that we can continue His work, and Satan’s evil plans will be foiled.
