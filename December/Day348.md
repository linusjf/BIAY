### Day 348 Put on the armor of God

To live as a true Christian means to live in a war zone on earth. The world around us is not a perfect place to live in, there are many distractions, temptations, anxieties, and opposition. The world values are opposed to the Kingdom's values and principles. We sometimes overlook the fact that the devil and his fallen angels are constantly at war against us trying to rob, steal, and destroy our souls.
For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens Ep 6:12

We need to draw strength from the Lord who is all-powerful and the enemy stands defeated in His Mighty and Matchless name, the name of Jesus.
Finally, draw your strength from the Lord and from his mighty power. Ep 6:10

We need to guard ourselves against the contact attack we are under, the way to do that is to put on the whole armor of God. In fact, it is stated twice to put on the armor of God. When things are important they are mentioned twice. Just like Jesus said ‚Äútruly truly I say to you‚Äù
Put on the armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the tactics of the devil. Ep 6:11

Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your ground. Ep 6:13
The armor of God is compared to a soldier‚Äôs armor, because we are in the battlefield.
So stand fast with your loins girded in truth, clothed with righteousness as a breastplate,
15and your feet shod in readiness for the gospel of peace.
16In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all \[the\] flaming arrows of the evil one.
17And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Ep 6:14-17

¬∑ Belt of Truth
¬∑ Breastplate of righteousness
¬∑ Shoes of Peace
¬∑ Shield of Faith
¬∑ Helmet of Salvation
¬∑ Sword of the Spirit ‚Äì the word of God

BELT OF TRUTH
As a Christian we know that the truth sets us free, so we always have to secure our lives in the truth. Just as the belt holds our cloths secure and prevents us from disgrace, so does truth. My mom always said ‚Äì ‚Äúif you tell one lie, you will need to tell 10 more lies to cover that up.‚Äù We have to hold firm to the truth of the Gospel and the truth about ourselves.

BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
None our us can claim to be righteous except through the righteousness we receive from Christ. We should always stay in a state of grace, going to confession if we have any mortal sin on our hearts. Going to regular Mass helps wash away the venial sins.

SHOES OF PEACE
Blessed are the feet that bring good news to the world. We are called to be peacemakers and ones who will bring people together. We are called to go out to the ends of the earth to proclaim God‚Äôs word. Wearing shoes means ready and willing to go out as the Holy Spirit leads.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns!‚Äù Is 52:7

SHIELD OF FAITH
In all circumstances we should hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. The evil one will shoot arrows of doubt, negativity, lies, confusion, envy, jealously, anger‚Ä¶ we are to hold up the shield of Faith, knowing that God will take care of us. Holding up the shield of faith means knowing that God is on our side and no weapon formed against us will prosper.

HELMET OF SALVATION
Knowing that Jesus has saved us from death and that He will give us eternal life should always be on our minds. If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or depression, guard your mind with the Helmet of Salvation.
SWORD OF THE SPIRIT ‚Äì THE WORD OF GOD
Imagine a soldier in a battle without his sword. The enemy will keep on attacking until the armor is broken. That is the case with many Christians today, they do not know the word of God. ‚ÄúMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge‚Äù So rightly said in Hosea we are unable to stand up against the devil because we do not know the Word of God. Remember Jesus in the desert fought off the devil with the Word of God. The Sword is the only offensive weapon we have, and so is the Word of God, it is sharper than any two-edged sword. If you want to live a victorious life, read scripture and memorize it. The Holy Spirit will bring to you the right scripture in battle.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
