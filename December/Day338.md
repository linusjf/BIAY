### Day 338 O death where your is your sting

All the advancement in science and technology has not allowed anyone to live forever. Death can be extended but never overcome.
None of the gods in this world can say they have overcome death or are able to rise again from the dead. Thanks be to God Jesus died and rose again, He now gives us eternal life.

‚ÄúDeath is swallowed up in victory.
55Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?‚Äù
56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
57But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Cor 15: 54-57

We have nothing to fear as the worst thing that can happen to anyone death, has been conquered by Jesus Christ. We have victory through Christ, we have life eternal, after we died we live forever. We just transition from earthly life to eternal heavenly life.

Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
52in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53For that which is corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility, and that which is mortal must clothe itself with immortality. 1 Cor 15:51-53

On our own we are not holy enough to enter into God‚Äôs presence, we are mortal and corrupt. But when we put on Christ, the immortal and incorruptibility we are made perfect and holy so we can enter into the presence of God.
Some of us have a lifetime to prepare and some will not, so we are to always be ready for the Lord. The seasons of the church, Advent and Lent are perfect times to reset and reevaluate our lives. Everything corrupt needs to be clothed with Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
