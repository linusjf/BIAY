### BIAY Day 356 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 4:20
*Whoever claims to love God, and yet hates a brother or sister, is a liar. For Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.*

The biblical understanding of true love is to will for the good of others, irrespective of whether they are related to us or not and irrespective of whether they love us or not, because ‚ÄúLove‚Äù is self-giving, and when others are in distress or troubled we are willing to pay a price to help them, even if it costs us our lives.

1 John 5:6
*This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is the witness, and the Spirit is truth.*

This verse refers to the baptism (water) and crucifixion (blood) of Jesus.

During the baptism of Jesus, God the Father declared that Jesus was His Son and this was witnessed by the Holy Spirit who appeared in the form of a dove.

When Jesus was crucified, after His death the centurion declared that Jesus was the Son of God.  It is believed that the centurion was inspired by the Holy Spirit because the centurion was a stranger and had no other way of knowing anything about the divine sonship of Jesus.

1 John 5:16-17
*If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one.  This is only for those whose sin is not mortal.  There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that.  All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.*

There are two type of sins:  Mortal (deadly or fatal) and Venial (forgiveable).
*Mortal sin* instantly destroys the divine life or the life of God within us, as it did with Adam and Eve.  Divine life gives us the ability to love without conditions but it is still subject to our choice.
*Venial sin* diminishes the divine life within us but does not destroy it instantly.

By virtue of our Baptism we belong to God's family.  Therefore, as an act of charity, and if we ourselves are in the Body of Christ, then we can pray and make atonement on behalf of the living believers on earth (Church militant) or deceased believers who have committed venial sins and are still in the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-26) (Church suffering in Purgatory) and God will restore their divine or supernatural life ("zoay" in Greek).\
We can pray for both types of venial sinners (Church militant and Church suffering) because both types belong to God's supernatural family.  But we cannot make atonement on behalf of the living or dead baptized members who have committed mortal sins because the guilty ones need to repent and that can be done only when they are living.  Moreover, mortal sins sever the baptized members from the Body of Christ.  The living ones can, however, once again become part of the Body of Christ after they repent and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and make atonement for their sins but the deceased ones have no hope of being saved.  Meanwhile, we can pray for the conversion of the living ones (1 Timothy 2:1-2).

1 John 5:18
*We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one cannot touch them.*
Jesus protects us from Satan from the time we are baptized because our baptism puts Satan on a leash therefore he cannot touch our souls (Mark 3:27).  But Satan tries to control us by luring us into his den with his deceptive offers of wealth, power, comfort, entertainment, etc.  To receive those offers we must get close to Satan.  When we choose to get close to him, we are actually going far from Christ and we fall into Satan‚Äôs dangerous trap, which is only a candy-coated ball of destruction.  The only way out of the trap is to follow God‚Äôs commandments, repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist, regularly, to give us the strength to fight Satan spiritually and stay with Christ.

1 Timothy 2:4
*God desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.*
God has predestined every human for glory.
Damnation is a failure of the human will or persisting in a willful turning away from God, to the end.

A good teacher always wishes that all his/her students must succeed in the final exams.  The teacher provides all the necessary resources, guidance and support to help everyone succeed but some students may still end up as failures by their own choices due to little or no effort from their side.  The teacher, however, did not prepare those students for failure.

We are not robots acting out a pre-programmed script.  We have free will to make our choice so let us make wise choices and choose God‚Äôs Will for us.

1 Timothy 2:1-4
*First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way.  This is good and pleasing to God our savior, who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.*
As per the above instructions of Paul, our petitions for our country, community, world, etc. are/must be included during Mass (Prayer of the Faithful) every Sunday because the sins of Christians have a negative effect on the community and environment around us.  Therefore, since the Church is a universal institution, we must pray for all people, specially for the Church and for those who are responsible for the welfare of the country.

During this intercession (Prayer of the Faithful) we must pray for:

1. the Church.
2. the world
3. the government
4. the sick and the suffering
5. specific needs
6. the deceased members of the community.

These are the prayers which are received by the angels and saints in Heaven and answered by God according to His Will (Revelation 5:8).
These prayers are sent up to God because we are part of the Communion of Saints in Heaven through baptism, but we have still not accomplished our mission on earth.  We encounter many obstacles in our daily lives which make it difficult for us to accomplish our mission on earth and remain holy, due to the damaged nature of our souls and because we are still in the flesh.
These prayers include general needs of the Church community, the public authorities, the oppressed, etc., whatever could be a possible obstacle in maintaining the holiness of the Church (God‚Äôs people).

1 Timothy 2:5-6
*For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and man, Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all.*
Jesus is the only mediator between God the Father and man, but not the only intercessor.  Jesus can mediate because He is both God and man.
