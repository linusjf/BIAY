### The Power of the Holy Spirit

### Day 340 A true Christian life should have a personal relationship with Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit.

Many people complain that faith and religion are boring and that they get nothing out of church. Sunday Mass becomes another weekend chore like grocery shopping. We may be missing one of these two important parts of our faith.
We see how the evil spirit tossed up the sons of Sceva, because they did not have a personal relationship with Jesus.

Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”
14When the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, tried to do this,
15the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I recognize, Paul I know, but who are you?”
16The person with the evil spirit then sprang at them and subdued them all. He so overpowered them that they fled naked and wounded from that house.
We cannot live our faith lives with textbook knowledge of Jesus, we need to have a loving and living relationship with Jesus. We cannot just claim to know “about” Jesus but need know him.

“You are one with Jesus as the body is one with the head. You must then have one breath with him, one soul, one life, one will, one mind, one heart, and he must be your breath, heart, love, life, your all.”—Saint John Eudes

The second thing missing in our life may be a relationship with the Holy Spirit. We may be like the Christians in Ephesus who had no clue who the Holy Spirit us.
When I was younger I though the Holy Spirit was just a nice dove that flew around and descended on Jesus at His Baptism. Some people think of the Holy Spirit as a symbol of fire, dove or wind.

He said to them, “Did you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?” They answered him, “We have never even heard that there is a holy Spirit.”
3He said, “How were you baptized?” They replied, “With the baptism of John.”
4Paul then said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”
5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6And when Paul laid \[his\] hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.Ep 19:2-6

The Holy Spirit is no simple dove, but the very life support of our souls. The Holy Spirit is our advocate, counselor, helper, teacher, guide and the very help that Jesus promised us. Jesus said it was better that He went away so that the Holy Spirit can be sent. The Holy Spirit gave the fearful disciples courage to come out of hiding and preach the good news – without fearing even death.
Let us spend time to speak with Jesus each day and listen to His words, be led by the Holy Spirit and live a love and joy filled life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Acts 19:5-6
*When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.*
*And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.*

The believers received two Sacraments.
The believers entered the Church with faith.  They were then baptized with water (v.5) (Sacrament of Baptism) to wash away all past sins (for adults), including the curse of original sin (for all), and make them worthy of being part of God’s family, thus enabling them to receive sanctifying graces and take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion).  Thereafter Paul (the Apostle/Bishop) confirmed them by laying his hands upon them (v.6) to receive the Holy Spirit (Sacrament of Confirmation).
When we receive the first Sacrament (water baptism) the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Jesus (1 Corinthians 12:13) but when we receive the second Sacrament (Confirmation) Jesus baptizes us with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 2:4). 
Through Baptism we receive the life of the Trinity and through Confirmation we receive the mission of the Trinity. 


Acts 19:11-12
*So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God accomplished at the hands of Paul that when face cloths or aprons that touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.*
God heals people even through material things or through dead bodies just as God heals our bodies through the doctors, and heals our souls through the priests; and just as God sanctifies us through water (baptism), and anoints us through oil, etc.
When the dead body of a Moabite touched Elisha’s dead body the Moabite became alive (2 Kings 13:20-21).
People were healed when they touched the fringe of the garment of Jesus (Mathew 14:35-36; Mark 5:28-29).
God uses people and material things to heal people because He wants us to remain in communication with each other to build a family relation.

Acts 19:13-16
*Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.”  Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.  But the evil spirit said to them in reply, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.*
Exorcism in the name of Jesus cannot be performed without faith in Jesus. 
Exorcism performed without the name of Jesus would be demonic. 
Exorcism performed without being in a state of grace can be dangerous for the exorcist. 

The authority to exorcise demons was given by Jesus only to the 12 apostles. He didn't give the authority to His other disciples. 
Exorcising demons is not something that anyone can do. To be a successful exorcist it is very important that a man has to be an ordained priest living in a state of grace otherwise it can prove to be disastrous or even fatal for him.
