### Day 343 Boast in our weakness

St Paul went through many trails and hardships as he persistently preached Jesus.
I am still more, with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, far worse beatings, and numerous brushes with death.

24Five times at the hands of the Jews I received forty lashes minus one.
25Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I passed a night and a day on the deep;
26on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own race, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers;
27in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights, through hunger and thirst, through frequent fastings, through cold and exposure.
28And apart from these things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 1 Cor 11:23-28

St Paul was beaten, stoned, shipwrecked, exposed to the dangers of elements, robbers, wilderness, sea, fasting, hunger and most hard of all daily pressure and anxiety for all the churches. Instead of running away from suffering, Paul decided to boast in them, boast in his weakness.
‚ÄúIf I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness‚Äù 2 Cor 11:30.

As a spiritual exercise let us try to reflect on two things.

1. What suffering am I willing to go through for the sake of the Kingdom?
2. What do I boast in, my strengths or my weaknesses.

In our weakness, we are strong, because God's power is made perfect in out weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
