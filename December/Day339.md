### Day 339 Living as a loving community

Many people stay away from church because of a bad experience with other folks at church. People are hurt intentionally or unintentionally, and people feel excluded or unworthy. Let us try to overcome all of these and come together as a loving community for Christ.

Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
Your every act should be done with love.
I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they made up for your absence,
18for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such people.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Cor 20: 13,14,17,18,20

St Paul encourages us to be on our guard and to stand firm in our faith, to be courageous and strong, and do everything out of love. We have to be strong both inside and outside the church, we should stand firm when someone tries to push us around, our faith should overcome any fear or overpower any negativity. We should do everything out of love, remember love is patient, kind, enduring, does not hold grudges, not proud or rude. We are called to be a good example in the church, and exhibit love where there seems to be a lack of love.

We should also love the Lord above everything else.
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Marana tha. 1 Cor 12:3

St Paul seems to be coming off to strong here when we said if anyone does not love the Lord let him be accursed. But a deeper understanding of the word can help.

Accursed: literally, ‚Äúanathema.‚Äù This expression (cf. 1 Cor 12:3) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in preparation for the Lord‚Äôs coming and judgment

During the season of Advent don‚Äôt we pray Maranatha?

Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the early Christian liturgy. As understood here (‚ÄúO Lord, come!‚Äù), it is a prayer for the early return of Christ.
Come Lord Jesus Come.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
