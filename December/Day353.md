### Day 353 A gentle and calm disposition

True beauty is not found in fashion, accessories, hairstyles or jewelry. Many people pay to a lot of money on designers cloths and accessories. It's true they may be in fashion but believing that it makes you more beautiful is a lie.
Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,
4but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God. 1 Pet 3:3,4

True beauty is from a gentle and calm disposition, internal beauty of the person is more important than looks.
A calm internal disposition is hard to come by in this disturbing world. But it‚Äôs not impossible to have it if can cast all our care unto the Lord.
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.1 Pet 5:7

The God who created everything we see cares about us, so we need not worry about anything, just stay close to God. God will take care of all our needs. We need to just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and we will be exalted in due time.

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet 5:6

We also have to be on the watch because the devil our enemy is prowling around looking for who he can devour, he comes to rob steal and destroy.
Let us stay close to God who cares for us, we will be protected if we stay in God‚Äôs shadow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 353 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 3:1-2
*Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.*

A woman must lead a devout Christian life, following God's commandments faithfully, so that even if her husband does not obey God's Word, the splendour of her Christian life will draw her husband towards Christ.
And Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the best example of a faithful and godly wife.

1 Peter 3:9-10
*But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God‚Äôs own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.*

A priest is a man chosen by God to offer the prescribed sacrifices on the Altar, in the Temple during worship.

*Once you were not a people, but now you are God‚Äôs people.*

To be "God‚Äôs own people" means to be in a Covenant relation with God.  Therefore, to be "not the people of God" means to be outside the Covenant of God (Hosea 2:23b).
Thus the Church is the new Temple as well as the new Israel (Galatians 6:16).

The Theology of Peter's first letter to the Church is of a Church in exile, a Church on a journey, a Church that is moving from this world to the world to come.   And just as the first Israel was taken out of Egypt and thereafter became sojourners, moving through the desert to the promised land, so also the believers to whom Peter wrote this letter, were wandering in the earthly exile and moving towards the heavenly promised land.

Family, married life, good works, prayers, etc.... are all spiritual sacrifices.

1 Peter 3:17
*For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.*

There are 3 reasons why God allows suffering in our lives:

1. To remind us to confess our sins of commission or omission and ask God for forgiveness (1 Peter 4:15).
2. To spiritually heal the good ones (1 Peter 4:14, 16 & 19).
3. To glorify the holy ones, as in the case of Jesus and His mother.
   Whenever we or our families go through suffering, besides praying for a solution or healing, we must focus on making a thorough examination of our conscience and confess any unconfessed sins.

1 Peter 3:19-20
*In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient while God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water.*

This was the last phase of the Messianic mission of Jesus.

Purgatory is a temporary condition for a soul that has passed individual judgment but still has the temporal component of sins to atone for before attaining the beatific vision.

Purgatory / Sheol / Hades is like a spiritual hospital (or preparation room) where the venial sins of the righteous ones are purged after they die so that their souls can be covered with white robes before they stand in front of a divine God.

The souls of the righteous ones of the old Covenant were preserved in the same or similar place for their venial sins to be purged until the holy Blood would be shed and the Gospel would be preached to them by Jesus because, although their earthly bodies had perished, their spirits were still alive (example: story of the rich man and Lazarus).

After His death, Jesus went down to Purgatory and preached the Gospel to the righteous ones of the old Covenant who had fallen asleep and thereafter, as prophesied (Daniel 7:22 & 27), they became saints (Mathew 27:52).  The cloud of witnesses (Hebrews 12:1) are those saints in Heaven (Hebrews 11:4-38).

In the ongoing liturgical celebration in Heaven (Revelation) all the angels and saints together pray for the saints on earth because our damaged human souls are in great need of God‚Äôs blessings.

While we owe it to our children to hand down the faith to them, we do owe it to our deceased parents, ancestors and other family members to pray for their souls to rest in eternal peace.
The saints in Heaven intercede for us continuously (Revelation).  By His death, Jesus reconciled God and man and thereby populated Heaven with saints and thus He also reconciled angels and saints.

On 1st November the Church celebrates the feast of all saints who are already in Heaven, and on 2nd November the Church dedicates the day to pray for the souls of all those saints who are waiting their turn in Purgatory.

1 Peter 3:21
*This prefigured baptism, which now saves you.*
Baptism is not the only time when we were saved.
Salvation is a lifetime process.
Christians are first saved (from going to Hell) when they are baptized, which is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit because Jesus paid the price by shedding His blood on the Cross, 2,000 years ago.
Christians are in the process of being saved during their lifetime when they pick up their crosses and follow Christ faithfully and when they faithfully follow the fundaments of their faith (Repentance, Sharing and Serving).
Christians hope to be saved, if they have endured to the end of their lives.

*It is not a removal of dirt from the body but an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.*
The great flood, which took place during the time of Noah, was only a symbol of baptism.
The rituals for washing which were introduced in the old Covenant from the time of Moses, were also symbols of the new Covenant baptism but they were also meant to remove dirt from the body as an analogy for the soul.\
But the baptism of Jesus is more powerful than its symbols.

The baptism of Jesus saves us from Hell because it washes away spiritual dirt (sins), to purify the soul, and thereby restores divine life within us, which in turn provides us with sanctifying graces to perfect our souls, without which we cannot enter Heaven.

*Water without the Trinity* washes physical dirt because water by itself does not have any power.
*Water + the Trinity* washes spiritual dirt (sins) because the water now has the power of God. The power of the Trinity in the presence of water is sufficient to erase the past sins of a person.

Once we are baptized, we can start receiving the regular sacraments (Reconciliation & Eucharist) to keep our souls constantly sanctified as long as we live.

1 Peter 5:8
*Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.*
The devil roars like a lion to scare people into believing that he is the lion of Judah whereas Jesus is the true lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5).

1 Thessalonians 2:11
*As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children.*
This is one of the reasons why we call our priests "Father" because they are our spiritual fathers.
