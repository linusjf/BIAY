### Day 345 Just being a good person is not our Christian calling.

"I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me"

Many people try to justify not going to Church by saying ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good person‚Äù. They are trying to justify themselves by following the law, not the Jewish law but their own law. People make up their own rules or follow the moral rules of natural law and think they will get to heaven. Heaven is described as a place where God is present and if people don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with God on earth then there is no point in going to heaven to be with God forever.

who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.Gal 2:16

We are not saved by works, so just doing good works will not get us to heaven. If we could be saved by being a good person then there was no need for Jesus to die for us.
If we are satisfied by just being a good person we fall into the trap of being perfect and not needing a savior, because we have already achieved what is good.
We are to have faith in Christ, we need to die to ourselves and live in Christ.

For through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;
20yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.
21I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.Gal 2: 19-21

Living a life united with Christ on earth will get us to heaven. When goodness itself lives in our heart, we radiate the love of Christ to this dark world.
It is no longer about me, it‚Äôs about Christ present in my heart. My hands are not mine anymore but Christ‚Äôs hands which love the poor and weak. My feet are not mine but Christ‚Äôs which are feet that bring good news to the world.
I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

Galatians 1:6-12
The false Gospel which Paul was referring to was the teaching which some people were spreading among the gentiles that accepting the Gospel and being baptized was fine, but if they truly wanted to be saved then, in addition, it was also necessary that they must be circumcised and they must follow the Mosaic Law.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

We must follow the Gospel which the Apostles have given us, not a Gospel that teaches us different, or a Gospel that has been modified.  In other words, if we depart from the Liturgy of the Church, we depart from Christ.

Galatians 2:10
Peter, James and John emphasized to Paul that he must always remember the poor.
From the time the law was first given to God‚Äôs people, God had emphasized that they must always take care of the poor (Deut. 15:11).  Jesus also reminded us of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).
Therefore, reading the Bible every day, praying for long hours, attending worship, etc. are all of no use if we have neglected the poor people around us.

Galatians 2:11-14
Peter was not giving any erroneous doctrinal teaching.  Paul opposed him because Peter was not practicing what he was preaching.
Spiritual leaders are sinners like us and are therefore likely to commit sins like us. Peter was trying to save his skin and therefore ended up going against his own teaching. In such cases they must be open to correction from their subordinates.

Galatians 2:16
*We, who are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles, yet who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.*

Paul was clearing the confusion among the Jews who had been baptized, that they had not received their hope for salvation because they were obedient to the Law of Moses, but that the gates of heaven had been opened for them because of God's grace.

We are not justified by works of the Mosaic Law or works that are not done for Christ.  The Mosaic Law was given to the people to discipline them and to live holy lives.  The Mosaic Law was not good enough to purify a person‚Äôs conscience/soul to receive salvation.   Therefore, after the resurrection, we now follow the Law of Christ, not the Law of Moses.

The early Church still being in its infancy, it was normal for the Jewish Christians to face such confusion because they were previously expected to strictly follow the Mosaic Law or else they would be cut out from God‚Äôs family.

Galatians 2:20
*Yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.*

Christ lives in us from the time we are baptized, and continues to live in us as long as we are in a state of grace and surrender our will to His Will.

Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was the first Christian in whom Christ lived physically, and the life which she lived in the flesh she lived by faith in the Son of God, her Son, who loved her and gave Himself up for her, as much as He gave Himself up for us.

Let us follow her example and live by true faith in Christ and for Christ so that Christ can live in us always.

Galatians 3:1-14
Paul was not speaking about good works of mercy, or against it.  According to the Jews "works of the Law" meant "strictly observing all the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law," example: ritual washing, circumcision, Sabbath, kosher diet, etc. Paul was explaining to the Galatians that by observing those ceremonies they would never be able to save their souls because those were only shadows of the reality of the Christian faith. They can be saved by faith in Jesus and by obeying all the commandments.
