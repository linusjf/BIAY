### Faith and Works

### Day 350 Doers of the Word, not hearer only.

We are called to be not just hearers of the Word but doers as well.
Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.

23For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his own face in a mirror.
24He sees himself, then goes off and promptly forgets what he looked like. James 1:23-24

Imagine going in front of the mirror in the morning and not combing your hair, it seems foolish, doesn‚Äôt it. But if we read God‚Äôs Word and commands and do not act upon them then we are fooling ourselves.
In the same way, if we say that we have faith that can move mountains but do not have works to prove it, then our faith is dead.
The formula ‚ÄúBelieve in your heart and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and you will be saved‚Äù is not complete.
Although Faith is necessary but faith alone is not enough, works are needed to demonstrate our faith. We are not hearers only but doers as well. In reality, we are not saved only by faith and works but are saved by grace.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day,
16and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, keep warm, and eat well,‚Äù but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is it?
17So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead. James 2:14-17

So the next time someone tells you faith only saves, ask them to search the Bible for the words ‚ÄúFaith alone‚Äù the only verse that will come up is James 2:17 which said faith by itself is dead.

It is easy to hear God‚Äôs word and love it, but hard to act on it. We may feel overwhelmed or powerless to be doers of the Word. Let me encourage you and remind you that God empowers us and we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

I have the strength for everything through him who empowers me. Phil 4:13

And we can rest assured that God will supply all our needs in accordance to the glorious riches we have in Christ Jesus.

My God will fully supply whatever you need, in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. Phil 4:19

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 350 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 1:12-18
God is a Tester, not a Tempter.
God does not tempt us but He does test us by allowing trials and tribulations in our lives.
Temptation is meant to deceive us and lure us into sin, which is the work of the devil, and we can overcome temptations only if our faith, love and trust in God is strong.

*Why is it necessary for God to test us?*
God does not test us for Him to know the result.  He already knows the result before we were born. God tests us so that we can be aware of our spiritual weaknesses and so that we can work on improving in those areas. The trials and tribulations (terminal exams) are meant to help us grow stronger in our faith and love and to prepare us spiritually for our final exam before we leave this world.

James 1:19-27
Our inability to listen to others arises from lack of patience. We are always eager to speak; we always try to give suggestions to others even when they don't ask us for it. Sometimes we have selective hearing. We listen only to the part of the conversation where we can give our knowledge, our opinion, our solutions, our judgement or our reply.  If something we have heard touches our pride, we choose to activate our anger and thereafter harsh words pour out of our mouth.

James is inviting us to listen attentively to others.  This means we must keep our eyes and ears open and maintain our silence, speaking only when it is necessary.

Sometimes we like to talk too much about our own problems, achievements and success but we don't have patience or interest to listen to the problems, achievements or successes of others.

James is advising us to learn to control our tongue, which is the cause of most of our sins, and to focus more on generosity towards the destitute, giving preference to widows and orphans.

James 2:1-9
James addresses one of the major problems in the early Church, which was the issue of discrimination. People were being grouped according to their wealth, possessions, power and status in the secular world.  As a result the less fortunate ones were being ignored and treated with disrespect while the successful ones were given more attention and treated with great respect.

As Christians, we must avoid giving importance to people just because they have a higher material value or status in life, because Jesus gave His life for every human, irrespective of their caste, religion, colour, status, power, etc.

Let us therefore check ourselves and see if we too have been making the same mistake as the early Christians did. If we have, then let us change that from today and start giving more attention to the less fortunate ones (the poor, the needy, the old age homes, etc.) while we treat all humans as equals.

James 2:14-17
James was reminding us of the words of Jesus (Matthew 7:24).
Jesus is not happy with only lip service from us.  He wants to see our works which prove our words (Matthew 25).  We cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbors or if we ignore our neighbors who are in need of help.

We have been created for a purpose and our mission on earth must begin with faith in Christ.  But faith without works is dead faith (James 2:17) because faith without works is only lip service.  Our faith must be tested, and we can prove our faith (belief and trust) in God only by our works (Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 14:12; 20:12‚Äì13; 22:12).  Part of our mission on earth is to do good works for Christ by doing good works for others, not for ourselves.

*What is ‚Äúworks‚Äù?*
James was speaking about all good works accomplished in Christ.
Loving and trusting God and obeying His commandments, even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations, is called ‚Äúworks.‚Äù

James 2:24
Salvation is not through Faith alone.
We enter the Kingdom of God (the Church) through faith but we will be judged by our works.

Philippians 3:2
*Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!*

Paul‚Äôs main enemies were the Jewish Christians who refused to accept the decision of the first council in Jerusalem that the gentile converts need not be circumcised.  Those Jewish Christian opponents were creating chaos in the Churches by spreading the erroneous message that for a Christian to be saved they must also follow the Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher food, animal sacrifices, etc.).

Philippians 3:4‚Äì11
Before his encounter with Jesus, Paul was puffed up with pride because he was circumcised, he was an Israelite, he belonged to one of the tribes of Israel, he was highly educated in the Mosaic Law under the patronage of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel, and above all, he had zeal for God. Like all Pharisees and Scribes, He believed that he was doing everything that was required to receive eternal life because he obeyed the Mosaic Law word-to-word. But unfortunately there was no feeling in his heart for humans.

Paul was highly educated but he couldn't see the truth.  He wanted to eradicate Christianity, not realizing that he was trying to eradicate the only source of eternal life.
Most of the time our education tends to make us aggressive and arrogant if we are not alert to sin and the devil's tricky ways.

After Paul had an encounter with Christ, he later realized that all his earthly achievements were just trash, compared to the glory that Jesus had offered him, even though the road to eternal life was going to be full of rocks and thorns.

After his encounter with Jesus, Paul wanted to forget his past, he wanted to forget Saul and try his best to follow Christ as Paul, not as Saul. It was the risen Christ within him who made it possible for Paul to face the suffering which he went through thereafter.

Like Paul, we too can sometimes swell up with pride because we are more educated than others, or because we are more successful in this life than others.  But if there is no God in our hearts and in our homes, and if we have no feelings for others, then all our achievements in this life are of no value in God‚Äôs eyes.  God is not interested in our success in this life.  God blesses us with earthly success so that we can use it to reach out to the people around us, specially the less fortunate ones.
Following Christ should not be limited to just reading the Bible, attending daily worship / Mass, fasting and praying.  Jesus wants us to open our eyes and ears and help the people around us with love, as if they were our close family members, specially the less fortunate ones.
