### BIAY Day 336 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 15:2
*No less dissention.*
This was Luke's polite way of saying that there was a huge explosive argument due to disagreement, that it almost led to a quarrel.
The members of the council didn't end up in dividing the Church in response to the difference of opinion.  They made a common decision and then abided by that decision.  That is the principle of an ecumenical council.

Acts 15:1-12
*Why was there a huge debate in the early Church?*

Paul‚Äôs refusal to impose the Mosaic Law upon the gentile converts, provoked very strong objection from the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem.  This was one of the common problems in almost all the first century Churches (Romans 3:21-31; Galatians 3:1-5).\
For more than a thousand years they were given to understand that, according to the Mosaic Law, an uncircumcised man, along with his family, cannot be part of God‚Äôs family (Genesis 17:12-14).

Although they understood that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism, they were unable to understand why the gentiles were being baptized and allowed into the Churches, without being circumcised.

When the Jewish Christians from the sect of Pharisees started spreading the wrong message, it created confusion within the entire Church.
This topic led to a huge debate between the Apostles and the priests, until Peter stood up during the Council at Jerusalem, and in his authority as the Pope / Prime Minister of God‚Äôs Kingdom (the Church), he made the final decision, through the power of the Holy Spirit, that people could now enter the Church and be part of God‚Äôs family through faith followed by baptism, not circumcision.\
Thus baptism replaced circumcision.

The purpose of showing Peter the vision (Acts 10:9-16) and sending him to preach to Cornelius and his household earlier (Acts 10:19-20), and thereafter to baptize them (Acts 10:48), was to teach Peter that the Mosaic rituals were soon to be replaced with new rituals.  With the Cornelius event in mind, the Holy Spirit may have also reminded Peter that before the Ascension, Jesus did not command them to circumcise all nations, but to baptize them.

Therefore, Paul‚Äôs refusal to impose the Mosaic law on the gentile Christians was supported by Peter on the ground that within his own experience God bestowed the Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household without pre-conditions concerning the adoption of the Mosaic law.

Satan always uses his disciples to create problems and confusion, but God allows those problems to teach us how to move forward on the right path, and we will do well if we live in obedience to God‚Äôs commandments.

The Apostles had not addressed this issue earlier, therefore by allowing this problem in the Church God was teaching the Apostles how to organize and develop the Church, just as God allowed problems in the House of Israel to teach Moses how to organize and develop his community (Exodus 18:19-24; Numbers 11:16).

Debates and problems in the Church between the bishops and the clergy are common and are required to help the Church grow. These are times of trial which we must go through for purification and growth. When there's a difference in opinion, a meeting is called and the debate begins with a prayer for guidance from the Holy Spirit. After the debate a common decision is arrived at.
The important thing is that the Church remained unified inspite of the debate.

When the Church is challenged by heresies then it becomes necessary to hold a council and come to a decision in order to protect the faith of its entire congregation.

However, when the faith of a minority is shaken by heresies, then the Bishop may resolve the issue through epistles as Paul did.

The council at Jerusalem was the first council held by the Church but not the only one.  Thereafter many councils have been held, as and when the need arose.

The *Mosaic Civil law* was not required to be followed universally because it applied only to Israel.  Therefore, it was eventually deleted.
However, the *Mosaic Religious and Moral laws* must be followed by the subjects (the Christians) of the holy Kingdom, and therefore cannot be deleted.  They were however gradually modified with the guidance of the Holy Spirit to suit the new Covenant requirement due to the change in priesthood (Hebrews 7:12).
Acts 15:7-21
Peter spoke on behalf of everyone and gave a doctrinal pronouncement about what the Church believes (Acts 15:7‚Äì12) because Peter was the first Pope / Prime Minister, and James gave a practical solution (Acts 15:13‚Äì21) because James was the Bishop of Jerusalem.

The Apostles (bishops) and presbyters (priests), in agreement with the whole Church (the laity), wrote a letter to the gentile Christians with their decision which became the new Law of the Church (Acts 15:22‚Äì29).

1 Corinthians 11:10
*For this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.*
This is a warning that gender confusion and improper attire, during worship, will offend the heavenly hosts. Angels are ministers of the natural order and angels are present during the sacramental worship of the Church (Hebrews 12:22). Therefore it is important that we stand in front of the Altar with modest clothing.

1 Corinthians 11:26
*For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord‚Äôs death until he comes.*
Paul, and the other Apostles, always ended the proclamation of the Gospel with breaking of the bread (Mass).

‚ÄúProclaiming the Gospel‚Äù means that during every (Mass) the Christians must re-live the ministry of Christ on earth from the baptism of Jesus to His resurrection, where the Priest represents Christ and the congregation represents the first disciples of Christ during His ministry on earth.

‚ÄúProclaiming the Gospel‚Äù includes :

> > )  forgiving the people‚Äôs sins (through the Penitential Rite);
> > )  glorifying God (The Gloria).
> > )  reading the scriptures from Old & New Testament, Psalms & Prophets;
> > )  preaching the Gospel;
> > )  teaching the people how to apply the Gospel to their lives with reference to the readings of the day (through the homily);
> > )  consecrating the bread and wine and offering them to God as a perfect sacrifice in atonement for sins (anamnesis / re-living the Upper Room and Calvary events); and,
> > )  celebrating the Resurrection by eating the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ (Communion) (re-living the post resurrection events) (Luke 24:30).

1 Corinthians 11:27-30
Paul uses judicial language because when we receive the Body of Christ in an unworthy manner (with a mortal sin) we are abusing the Body of Christ and therefore breaking the Covenant with God, the result of which we have seen in the case of Judas (Acts 1:18) when he made the same mistake (John 13:27).

When we continuously abuse the Body of Christ / Eucharist we are in a continuous Covenant with Satan, which is the reason why we have so many problems in life.  Receiving the Body of Christ with a mortal sin is like playing with fire.

A person cannot become guilty of eating and drinking the Body and Blood of Christ unworthily if the bread and wine were not the real Body and Blood of Christ.

During every Mass when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution ‚Äúthis is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant‚Äù (Matthew 26:28) we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse (Revelation 16:1-17).\
During every Mass we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement.

1 Corinthians 11:27
Our sacrifice becomes cause of our judgement when it is offered with an unclean heart because we offer a sacrifice for the renewal of a Covenant, not a contract.

When we don‚Äôt receive the Body of Christ / Communion in a state of grace or we do not attend the new Covenant Passover celebration (Mass) every Sunday, God is glorified less than He should be and the world is sanctified less than it should be.

It is, therefore, not surprising that sin in the world is increasing, thus giving Satan the power to cause famines, natural disasters, crisis at state / national / global level, problems between family members, terminal illnesses, and suffering & misery in many other forms.

1 Corinthians 12:12‚Äì13
*For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.  For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.*
We (the body parts of Christ) are united with Christ (the Head) through our Baptism.
One single part of the human body cannot say that *it is a body.*  It can only be *a part* of the human body.  But when all parts are in union with each other then they become *one body.*
Likewise, each individual Christian cannot say that he/she is the Body of Christ.  We become one body only when we are all united in Christ by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace.  If any one of our body parts is separated permanently, it would definitely decay.  Moreover, a separated body part cannot function on its own, without the head, because it will have no life.
Therefore, if we don't live our Christian lives in union with Christ (the Head), then our sinful soul will eventually decay and end up in Hell.

### Day 336 The gifts of the Holy Spirit.

In our modern day and age, we seem to have either suppressed or forgotten the gifts of the Holy Spirit. St Paul urges us not to be unaware of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;
5there are different forms of service but the same Lord;
6there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 1 Cor 12:1-6

There are different gifts but there is only one reason for them, for the service of the Lord. All these gifts are given to us by the same Spirit. These gifts can be used to edify our own spiritual lives and the lives of everyone around us. The gifts are for the building up of the church. The gifts do not make one great or one insignificant, let us remember that it is a gift we did not earn it or deserve it.
To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
9to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
10to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. 1 Cor 12:8-10

The gifts can be listed as:

1. Wisdom
2. Knowledge
3. Faith
4. Healing
5. Mighty deeds(Miracles)
6. Prophecy
7. Discernment of spirits
8. Tongues
9. Interpretation of tongues

The gift of knowledge is to gain supernatural insight into something or someone‚Äôs life like people have a vision of something or a strong feeling that the Holy Spirit is speaking to them about something.

The gift of Wisdom is similar to knowledge only difference is it‚Äôs usually direction from the Holy Spirit on how to act, it‚Äôs more like getting hearing Holy Spirit teach us the will of God or at least a hint about what God wants us to do.
The gift of Faith is not just regular faith that we all have, faith the Jesus is God and the other basic teachings of the church. The gift of Faith is a supernatural gift that we gain such confidence at a certain moment that we know that we are able to pray for God‚Äôs supernatural intervention.
People with the gift of healing can lay hands and pray over the sick for natural or supernatural healing.

The gift to work mighty deeds and Miracles are a great sign for the non-believers.
A person with the gift of prophecy is able to listen to the Spirit and speak out God‚Äôs words, usually, you will hear the person with this gift say ‚ÄúI sense the Lord saying‚Äù followed by the message ‚Äì it usually is a like a verse from the Bible. The prophecy should always be in alignment with the teaching of Jesus and the church.

The gift of discernment of spirit is a gift that will help us know the where the prophecy is coming from or what spirit is behind a certain action. Like a person who seems to be possessed by the evil may actually only have a medical problem. Anyone with the gift of discernment will be able to discern if it‚Äôs because of evil spirit or not.

The gift of tongues is one of the most common gifts, the person with the gift of tongues prays according to the will of the Father in mourns and groans too deep for any human language to explain. But God who looks into the hearts knows the intent.

The gift of tongues is most useful to the congregation when someone has the gift of interpretation of tongues. So that everyone in the congregation will be able to know what the person praying in tongues has just prayed.
Although the gifts of the Spirit may see pretty spectacular, we should not use the gifts as a yardstick for the greatness of the person. Because the gifts are not earned but given, the gifts will cease but one thing will remain. Let us wait till tomorrow to know what is greater than any gift.

Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.
But I shall show you a still more excellent way. 1 Cor 12:31

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
