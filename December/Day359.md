### Day 359 Behold I stand at the door and knock.

In the book of the revelations John finds himself in what seems like heaven, he finds himself face to face with Jesus. Of Course it’s hard to describe in human language what he actually saw and heard. He tries to compare it to things that we can relate to, the phrases “like a fiery flame”, “voice was like the sound of rushing water “, “his face shone like the sun at its brightest.” It is impossible to describe God, especially when we encounter Him in all his glory. Our reaction would be no less than John’s reaction, in fact we may be even more fearful as none of use are as worthy as John who stood by Jesus at the cross, accepted Jesus’ mother Mary as his own and even was willing to die for Christ, he was boiled but did not die - thrown on the island of Patmos to die.\
When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his feet as though dead. He touched me with his right hand and said, “Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last, the one who lives. Once I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys to death and the netherworld. Rev 1:17,18
Jesus has already died on the cross for us and paid for our sins. He rose again and lives forever, now Jesus holds the keys to death and life and wants us to make every effort possible to be saved. Many have the idea that Jesus died for us and we don’t need to do anything to go to heaven. Not doing anything is like having a billion dollars in the bank but not using it. The reading in Timothy that we heard today drives this point home.
7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. 2 Tim 4:7-8
Tying the above scripture to the words of Jesus “To the victor” repeated in all the instructions to the 7 churches, we know for a fact that we are to keep fighting and running the race, keeping the faith till the end, we will receive the crown of righteousness not just because of our holiness but because of our faithful persistence in living a good life and loving Jesus.
“To the victor, who keeps to my ways until the end,I will give authority over the nations. Rev 2:26
We all are trying our best and working in the Lord’s vineyard enduring many sufferings but we need to ask ourselves this question everyday, “Have we lost our first love for Christ?” “Are we just going through the motions and have lost our desire to have an intermittent loving relationship with Christ?”
“I know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate the wicked; you have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not, and discovered that they are impostors. Moreover, you have endurance and have suffered for my name, and you have not grown weary.
Yet I hold this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. Rev 2:2-4
As time goes on in our spiritual lives we tend to become mediocre in our faith. Sunday Mass seems like an obligation and doing charity seems like a burden. We don’t seem to have any desire to evangelize and seem to be very fickle in our holiness. Let us read these words of Jesus and repent of any such laziness.
“I know your works; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. Rev 3:15-16
Reading this harsh warning may cause us to get afraid of Christ, but remember God only Chastises the ones He loves. Jesus always wants the best for us, he gives us many opportunities to repents and is always standing by the door waiting to come into our lives and redeem us.
Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise. Be earnest, therefore, and repent. “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, \[then\] I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me. Rev 3:
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 359 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation (Introduction)
The Book of Revelation has always been a scary story for many people, the same feeling that Adam and Eve went through when they chose to see the Word of God through the eyes of Satan.\
But at the beginning of the Bible, after the fall of Adam & Eve, God had promised to redeem us (Genesis 3:15).  Thereafter, throughout the Bible, God has been giving us hope for a glorious life with Him for eternity.  God would therefore NOT go back on His promise and drown our hope with a scary story at the end of the Bible because God is a loving Father who always keeps His promises.
This Book is not a warning about future geopolitics or an instruction book for the end-times.\
For the first century Christians, this book was about current and future events.\
For us in the 21st century, this book is about past, present and future events.\
This book shows us how God is worshipped in Heaven so that we understand why we must follow a liturgical service to worship God on earth.

The Book of Revelation is a summary of the entire Bible. Therefore we will not be able to understand the Book of Revelation unless we understand the entire Bible (old and new Testaments).

For the first century Jewish Christians, the Book of Revelation was a picture of the Temple in Heaven and the heavenly liturgy, which seemed to match with their earthly Temple and their earthly liturgy.
Like Moses (Exodus 25:9), King David also received the plan of the Temple from God Himself.

The Temple was to be built according to the Court/Temple of Heaven (Wisdom 9:8; Hebrews 8:5).
Therefore the liturgy of the first Passover, which God gave to Moses, and the liturgy of the new Passover (the Mass), which Jesus gave to the Apostles, were meant to be replicas of the ongoing liturgy in Heaven.
Whereas Israel worshipped God in imitation of the angels, John saw one common worship in the heavenly Temple shared by men and angels.
Whereas only priests were allowed in the Holy place of Solomon's Temple, in Heaven there was a nation of priests (Revelation 5:10).
The Jewish Christians could also see many things happening in Heaven exactly as they celebrated the new Covenant Passover (the Mass):

The union of Heaven and earth, during Mass, is like the fruitful union of a man and his wife in love.  That is why the Church is called “the bride of Christ” and the book of Revelation unveils that bride.  The “apokalypsis” is therefore the communion of the Church and Christ, which is also referred to as “the marriage supper of the Lamb.”

The same imagery is used in the Book of Revelation for the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9) because our physical marriages on earth reflect the spiritual marriage between Jesus and His bride (the Church).

The best way to understand the Book of Revelation is to see it in the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass, and the best way to understand the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass is to see it in the Book of Revelation.  Both must go together; they are inseparable; they cannot be divorced.

Worship, in Heaven includes :

1. the Liturgy of the Word, and
2. the Liturgy of the Eucharist / new Passover.

The two halves of the Heavenly liturgy correspond with the two parts of the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass on earth.

In chapter 1, Jesus blesses the Lectors who read the three Readings (the Scriptures and Psalms) at the beginning of the Liturgical Service during Mass; Jesus also blesses those in the congregation who hear the Word of God attentively and apply it to their lives.

Chapter 2 represents the Penitential Rite where Jesus reminds the congregations to repent for their sins.

2 Timothy 3:14-15
*But you, remain faithful to what you have learned and believed, because you know from whom you learned it, and that from infancy you have known the sacred scriptures, which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.*

Learning scripture must be started at a young age, preferably from childhood, as commanded by God, because our memory power is strongest than when we get older.  Timothy was able to learn the Scriptures during his childhood because his mother and grandmother were godly women.  Like them, if we help our children to be familiar with the Scriptures when they start learning to speak, it will help them to know how to face negative situations and fight evil as they grow up, just as Jesus did (Matthew 4:3-10), and thus remain close to God at all times.

2 Timothy 3:16-17
*All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof/ refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the one who belongs to God may be competent/proficient, equipped for every good work.*

“Theopneustos” in Greek means Inspired or God-breathed.
But although the scriptures are the Word of God, they bear the style of the human authors.
This is a mystery similar to the incarnation.

Just as the Word of God in flesh is both human and divine, so also the Word of God in scripture is both human and divine (God’s Word written by human hands) (Exodus 34:1 & 27-28).
Just as the Word of God in flesh took on every nature of humans except sin, so also the inspired Word of God in scripture comes to us with all the limitations of human language, except errors.

Scripture was not dictated by God. The Holy Spirit inspired the Evangelists to write the scriptures but allowed them to use their talents to write, so the accounts recorded by all four are not exactly the same word-to-word.  It is like the Holy Spirit taking a picture of the same object with four cameras of different brands.

God is its principal author, with the writer as the human collaborator.
Thus the Scriptures are the Word of God in human language.

Paul tells Timothy to continue in what he has learned for two reasons:
a) because he has been educated in the scriptures, and;
b) because he knows from whom he has learned it (Paul himself).  This is a direct appeal to apostolic tradition, the oral teaching which the apostle Paul had given Timothy.

If we don't understand the Bible then it just means we have to study it in more detail or do some research ourselves under the guidance of the right teachers.

But although all scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for correction, for training in righteousness, etc., teaching the faith is not limited only to written scripture, because faith cannot be understood completely only from written tradition.  To understand faith completely we need the help of the written tradition as well as the traditions handed down by word of mouth, which we need to hold fast to, as Paul tells us (2 Thessalonians 2:15).

2 Timothy 4:21
*Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.*

After the death of Peter, Linus was chosen to be the successor of Peter as the second Pope / Prime Minister of the holy Kingdom.  Linus was a Roman Christian.
