### BIAY Day 365 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 21:1
The “new heavens and the new earth” represent the transformed universe.  Just as our bodies will be the same bodies which we have now, but transformed after our resurrection, so also the new heavens and new earth will be the same heavens and earth, but transformed, that is, restored to their original sanctified form before the fall.  Our bodies and the universe will both be too glorious to be imagined with our current human brains.

Creation has not been redeemed yet. As of now only our souls have been redeemed (Romans 8:23), through baptism.  After our baptism, when we (Christians) live in total obedience to God we contribute to the sanctification of the world and the glorification of God (Matthew 5:16).  That is why Jesus gave us the sacraments so that our souls can survive spiritually in this fallen world (1 John 5:18) while we transform the world through our obedience to God, because without Jesus (the sacrament) we are nothing (John 15:5).

Revelation 21:3-4
*“Behold, God’s dwelling is with the human race.  He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will always be with them as their God.  He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away.”*

“God’s dwelling” means “Tabernacle” (Leviticus 26:11; Ezekial 37:27; Exodus 29:45) the place where God dwelt with His people in the Old Covenant (Exodus 40:34).\
This ancient promise given by God through the prophets, is fulfilled through the Church (Jeremiah 24:7; 31:33; 32:38; Ezekial 11:20; 14:11; 37:23 & 27; Zechariah 8:8; Isaiah 25:8; 35:10).

In the New Covenant, God dwells with us (Emmanuel) in the “Tabernacle” in Church, and within us, as God-man, when we receive the Body of Christ / Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace.  But God’s ancient promise will be effective only if we continue leading holy lives.

The old creation could not give the people peace and happiness on earth and eternal life because the Old Covenant was not renewable and, due to the original sin, the power of evil was greater than good.

In the new creation, however, we have received a New Covenant which is renewable through the Sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) (John 20:21-23) and the Eucharist (Communion), and through our Baptism we have received the peace of Christ, therefore we can now have eternal life.  But the baptized ones can be happy only if they detach themselves from this world and rejoice in their sufferings.
In God’s Church, the “old order” of death has passed away.

Revelation 21:5
*The one who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.”*

This is not a future event.  This is a present event.  God will not make new things but He will make the existing things new by reviving the dead creation when we are baptized (2 Corinthians 5:17).

After going through the waters of the Red Sea, although the people of the old Covenant roamed in the wilderness, they actually belonged to a physical homeland (Israel) which they had not seen.

Similarly, after we are baptized, we, the people of the new Covenant, live physically in this world (the wilderness) but we do not belong to this world.  We belong to our homeland (Heaven) which we have not yet seen.  It is our homeland because we are now children of our Father in Heaven by virtue of our baptism.

Creation awaits restoration through the baptism of all humanity (Romans 8:19-23) and the reception of the Sacraments.  Therefore, by leading holy lives we must be an example for the unbelievers so that they too may believe and come into God's kingdom (Matthew 5:16).

Revelation 21:6
*It is accomplished.*
God’s reign on earth, as God-man, already began when Jesus offered Himself on the Cross to complete the liturgical procedure of the Passover of the new Covenant (John 19:30).

*To the thirsty I will give a gift from the spring of life-giving water.*
The water of baptism will be given to those who desire or thirst for it.

Revelation 21:7
*The victor will inherit these gifts, and I shall be his God, and he will be my son.*
The victor is the Christian who overcomes the forces of evil, holds fast to the faith and does God’s Will even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations.  The victorious Christian enjoys divine affiliation by adoption, the promise made to the Churches (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; & 3:5, 12, 21; Galatians 4:4–7; Rom 8:14–17).

Revelation 21:10
*He took me in spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from God.*

John was now in Heaven in spirit, therefore he was shown the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the Kingdom of God in Heaven.  The new earthly Jerusalem is a replica of the heavenly Jerusalem in spirit, because when we take part in the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), after we are purified through the Penitential Rite (Revelation 2 & 3) our spirits join the angels and saints in Heaven in their ongoing liturgy to worship God (Revelation 4:2) while our bodies are still on earth.  Consequently, the words of the Lord’s prayer *"may Thy kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven"* are nowhere more profoundly fulfilled than during the celebration of the (the Mass), because, during this celebration, Heaven and earth are united in the most perfect way.

Revelation 21:12
*The Holy City had a massive, high wall, with twelve gates.*
A city with high walls and gates resembles a sheepfold and is a metaphor for the Church.\
The heavenly Jerusalem has high spiritual walls to keep Satan out of its boundaries.
Similarly, like the sheepfold, the high spiritual walls of the Church on earth protect the Christians from predators/Satan.  The high spiritual walls in a Church become stronger with the holiness of God's people.  Like the sheep in a sheepfold, we are safe only as long as we are spiritually inside the Church, that is, if we lead holy lives. We can either be inside the Church or outside it.  We cannot be lukewarm.
The good Shepherd (Jesus) will not allow any predator (Satan) to enter the sheepfold (Church) and snatch the sheep (holy souls) which belong to the Shepherd.

Revelation 21:22
*I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.*
In the new Jerusalem, the Temple/Church is where the Body of Christ (Eucharist) is because the Body of Christ is the Church/Temple (John 2:21).\
In partaking of the Eucharistic meal, people became what they receive “the Body of Christ” / the Church.  Hence, the Church is the Eucharist.

Revelation 21:27
*Nothing unclean will enter it (the holy city Jerusalem), nor anyone who does abominable things or tells lies. Only those will enter whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.*

At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and eat from the forbidden Tree, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).

Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:22), so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.

But the decree forbidding humanity to eat the fruit from the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:22) has been revoked by Christ, therefore, now the children of Adam & Eve, who are born again through Baptism, have been given the privilege of being in a state of grace through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (John 20:23) so that they can eat the fruit (the Body of Christ / Communion) from the Tree of Life (the Cross) and receive divine life so that Jesus can raise them up on the last day (John 6:54).

Jesus has thus brought us back to God's original plan by preparing us for Eternal Life in the new Passover (Liturgy of the Mass), so that we can enter the Kingdom of God in Heaven whenever we die, and live forever with Christ.

Revelation 22:1-2
*Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city.*
This is a Trinitarian image where the throne of God is the presence of God the Father, the throne of the Lamb is the presence of God the Son and the river of the water of life is the presence of the Holy Spirit.  It is the same river of living water which Jesus promised us according to the Gospel (John 7:37-39).

*On either side of the river grew the Tree of Life.*
The tree of life had disappeared from salvation history after the fall of man (in the book of Genesis), but we now have access to it (in the book of Revelation) at the end of the Bible because we are now in the eighth and final stage of the journey of salvation.

Revelation 22:3
*The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.*
To know how to worship God in Heaven the way He wants us to, we must practice worshipping Him on earth, through a liturgy (the Mass), by following how the Apostles worshipped God.\
In Heaven there is no training center. The Kingdom of God on earth (the Church) is the training center.  We must therefore attend Mass every Sunday and remain in a state of grace at all times.

Hebrews 11:1
Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will surely happen.  It gives us assurance about things we cannot see.

Faith helps us to trust in God's power and providence and to believe that nothing can harm us without God's permission.  Faith enables us to see the invisible realities that surpass the visible ones and to look forward to the eternal rewards which outweigh the temporal sufferings.

Hope is the confident desire of obtaining a future good that is difficult to attain. It is therefore a desire which implies seeking and pursuing some future good that is not yet possessed but wanted.  This future good draws out a person's volition. Hope is confident that what is desired will certainly be attained.  Hope recognizes that the object wanted is not easily obtained and therefore requires effort to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way.

We enter the Church with faith in the resurrection of Jesus and we remain in the Church with faith in the sacraments.  The risen Christ was seen by hundreds of people but the living body of Jesus in the sacraments has not been seen by any human till today.  It is total faith that God will keep His promise and grant us eternal life if we obey His commandments and receive the relevant sacraments regularly.

Hebrews 11:32-40
Through all their afflictions the people experienced one thing in common and that was the presence of God, His comfort and His strength.

Hebrews 12:1-2
*Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us and persevere in running the race that lies before us while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfecter of faith.*
The “cloud of witnesses” are the saints referred to in Hebrews 11.  Christian life is to be inspired not only by the Old Testament saints but above all by Jesus. As the architect of Christian faith, Jesus had himself to endure the Cross before receiving the glory of His triumph (Hebrews 12:2). Reflection on His sufferings should give His followers courage to continue the struggle, if necessary, even to the shedding of blood (Hebrews 12:3–4).

Hebrews 12:5-6
*You have also forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons: “My son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord or lose heart when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines; he scourges every son he acknowledges.”*
After baptism we still incur a debt for post baptismal sins.
As an act of charity we can apply our sufferings as penance for the sins of others to reduce or remove any impediments to their holiness but our charity, however, does not contribute to the growth of holiness of others.

Hebrews 12:14
*Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.*
We become holy by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly.  We maintain our holiness by reading the Scriptures and obeying the teachings of Christ.

We cannot enter Heaven unless we are as holy as Jesus in His humanity, but we cannot reach the same level of holiness as Jesus due to the weakness of our souls.
However, if we have made sincere efforts to live in obedience to God, led a humble life, died in friendship with Christ (with sanctifying grace), then we will have to remain in Purgatory for a while for our final purification (1 Corinthians 3:11-15).

Hebrews 12:16 (also Genesis 25:29)
*See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person, who sold his birthright for a single meal.*\
Birthright was a symbol of salvation which was to be handed down to the son.\
Let us make sure that we don't sell our birthright (salvation) for a bowl of comfort or a few coins that cannot give us eternal life.
If we die rejecting God, we will lose our inheritance in heaven forever.

Hebrews 12:18-19
*You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.*
This was the scenario at Mount Sinai, in the old Covenant, when God appeared to Moses and spoke to him, and the people could not bear the presence of God (Exodus 20:18-19).  But that was due to the absence of sanctifying graces within their souls.\
It is the same reason why no human on earth can see the face of God and live.  It is the same reason why those in Hell will burn forever because God’s glory extends even upto Hell.  It is like standing in front of the sun, even if we were ten kilometers away from the sun.  Due to Adam & Eve’s sin we, on earth, do not have the power to withstand that heat.

The author was consoling the people that they were now in a much higher position than the people of the old Covenant.
In the new Covenant, when we are baptized, we receive sanctifying graces which perfect our souls.  But the graces remain within our souls only until we break the Covenant by committing a mortal sin.  Due to the weakness of our souls, the Covenant must therefore be renewed regularly by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist so that we remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times and continue receiving sanctifying graces.

Hebrews 12:22-24
*But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.*
The "assembly of the firstborn" is the Church on earth (the congregations who gather together to celebrate the Passover feast / the Mass) and the "spirits of the righteous made perfect" are the saints in Heaven, both together making up the entire Body of Christ, the Church, with an emphasis on the heavenly component, which is the source of our power.
While on earth we have bodies with spirits/souls, without which the body would decay. Saints in heaven are only spirits. God has perfected them because they were righteous when they left the earth.

When we (the assembly of the firstborn) gather together in Church (Mount Zion) to celebrate the new Passover / Mass, we join the angels and saints (spirits of the righteous made perfect) in worshipping God by singing their perpetual hymn (holy, holy, holy, ……..) (Revelation 4:8) while Jesus (the mediator) intercedes for us to make atonement for our sins with His precious Blood (through Him, with Him, in Him……..) (Hebrews 7:25).

Thereafter we celebrate the feast with a sacrificial meal (Communion) along with the angels and saints (festal gathering).  If we have this meal with mortal sins on our soul then we will have to face the judgement of God (the judge of all) (1 Corinthians 11:27).  During worship the priest eventually leads us to the Altar (the heavenly Jerusalem) where Jesus, the High Priest & King waits for us (Revelation 14:1).

Mount Zion is the hill in Jerusalem on which Jesus instituted the Eucharist / Last Supper) (on Maundy Thursday), the same place where the Church was born when the Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles, on the mother of Jesus and on the first congregation, on Pentecost Sunday.

The Last Supper and Pentecost Sunday were the two events which sealed the new Covenant.  God blessed Zion abundantly in the old Covenant (Psalm 2:6; 132:13-14)
The Letter to the Hebrews was written in the first century AD when devotion to the angels was still very common.

David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David (2 Samuel 5:7).
Every time we gather around the Table of the Lord (the Altar) to worship God our spirits are actually in Heaven with the angels and saints celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus in the new Passover.

Hebrews 12:24
*The spirits of just men made perfect.*
The saints in heaven right now are incomplete because they do not have their bodies. This is why Scripture refers to the blessed in heaven as “the spirits/souls of the martyrs” (Rev. 6:9).

Hebrews 13:11-12
*For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, are burned outside the camp.*\
*Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.*
The animals which were burned outside the camp were a shadow of Jesus who was an image of the first Adam on the Cross.  But the blood of Jesus is holy, so after the first Adam was destroyed outside the city gates, the blood of Jesus is offered during every Mass to sanctify us by making atonement for our sins (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).
