### BIAY Day 362 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 12:1
*A great sign appeared in the sky; a woman clothed with the sun.*
The woman is the Church (Ephesians 5:22-24) besieged by Satan but preserved in safety by God.
The woman is daughter Zion who brought forth Israel’s Messiah.
The woman is the new Eve (Mary).

*A woman clothed with the sun.*
The sun in John’s vision was the Holy Spirit who overshadowed Mary since the time of the incarnation (Luke 1:35) and likewise overshadows the Church.\
In the old Covenant, the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit was symbolized by covering the Ark with pure gold (Exodus 25:11).
The Ark of the old Covenant was a box.  It was a shadow of Mary and a symbol of the Church.
The Ark of the new Covenant is a woman, the Mother of our Lord.

*..... with the moon under her feet,.....*
This woman is in Heaven.
\*......... and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
This woman is the queen.
Mary and the Church are the fulfillment of the promise which God had made in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).
John does not refer to the "woman" as “soul” because she was taken to Heaven body and soul, whereas John refers to the martyrs as souls (Revelation 6:9).
When John saw this vision, Mary had already left this world, even before the destruction of the Temple in AD 70, so she was already in Heaven.

“Rahem” (in Hebrew/Aramaic) means “mercy” as well as “womb.”
God's mercy for the world came through the womb of Mary.
As commanded by God, before the Babylonian attack (Jeremiah 20:4), the Ark of the Covenant, the Tent and the Altar of incense were hidden by prophet Jeremiah in a cave and were to be revealed only after God would gather His people together and show His mercy (2 Maccabees 2:4-7).   Thereafter, the Temple was desolate because the Ark was not in the Temple (Matthew 23:38).

Revelation 12:3
The dragon is represented by the evil and corrupt rulers of the evil empires.

Revelation 12:4
These stars are the angels who obeyed Satan and followed him and were therefore all cast out of heaven.
The devil will succeed in misleading one-third of the Christians to follow him.

*One third of the stars..…*
Why only one-third ?
It is believed that one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Father, one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Son, and one-third of the angels were to worship and serve the Holy Spirit.\
All 3 groups of angels have a superior angel and Lucifer/Satan was one of them.

Angels are on a higher level than humans. They are pure spirits. They have free will but they do not have the option of repentance because they have full knowledge of everything, including the consequences of their actions. Their knowledge is not limited like humans. Therefore they can only obey or disobey and their will is irrevocable.

*Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave birth.*
Satan was waiting for a chance to destroy Jesus after his birth.
According to the prophecy of Daniel, Satan (the dragon) had some knowledge, though not exact, regarding the timeline when the Messiah would be born, and Satan was aware that he would be destroyed by the Messiah sent by God as prophesied by God (Genesis 3:15).  But being a spirit, Satan needed the body of a greedy, selfish, rich, evil and powerful ruler, who serves him, to carry out his mission.  He therefore united himself to king Herod who perfectly met Satan’s criteria, because Herod was ambitious, paranoid and so possessive with regard to the throne that he had killed his own family members (one wife and sons) who, according to Herod, were seeking to snatch the throne from him.
Satan (the dragon) also joined himself later to the evil rulers who persecuted the infant Church (the Body of Christ) and tried to destroy it, though without success.

Revelation 12:13
Satan went after the woman because he hates the new Woman. Why?
Satan succeeded in tricking the first Woman to poison the first Adam to bring eternal death to God's people, but he didn't succeed in tricking the new Woman / the new Eve and therefore she gave life to the new Adam (Jesus), who is able to give God's new people eternal life because of the new Woman / the new Eve / Mary the Mother of Jesus, and Jesus will eventually destroy Satan.

Revelation 12:14
“Great eagle” is a symbol of the power and swiftness of divine help (Psalm 91:4; Exodus 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isaiah 40:31).
God protected the infant Church during the persecution by Nero, who ruled for three and a half years.\
God also provided divine assistance when the Church went underground for three and a half centuries, the guarantee which He had given in the Old Covenant (Genesis 3:15).  In the New Covenant Jesus confirmed the guarantee of the same divine assistance (Mathew 16:18), because the celebration of the new Passover (Mass) must go on until the end of time.

Revelation 12:17
If the devil has been constantly throwing major problems in our lap then we must rejoice that we have been counted by God as worthy to be called the children of our heavenly mother Mary because she will be our mother willingly only if we are obeying her Son (John 2:5).
The dragon was angry with the woman because he did not succeed in deceiving her either before she gave birth to the Redeemer or after.
The dragon makes war on the rest of her children because Jesus gave His mother to them as their spiritual mother (John 19:26-27) to feed them, nurture them and raise them as children who are pleasing to God the Father, just as she raised her own Son (Matthew 3:17; 17:5).  This is her task as Queen Mother until the end of time.  It is her duty to form us into saints in union with her spouse, the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:31-35 & 38).

Revelation 13:1
Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with ten horns (power) and seven heads; on its horns were ten diadems (monarchy), and on its heads blasphemous names.
horns = power;
diadems = monarchy.
The first beast, symbolizing the pagan Roman empire or its evil and corrupt rulers, becomes the dragon’s agent.
Domitian, like Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Dn 7:8, 11, 25), demanded that he be called by divine titles such as “our lord and god” (blasphemous name).
Most of the Roman emperors made the same demand.\
The future first beast can be any similar evil, corrupt & powerful political authority.

Revelation 13:11
The second beast tries to look like *the Lamb* (of God) to deceive God’s people (Matthew 24:5).
The second beast arises from the land, symbolizing the anti-Christ or evil and corrupt religious authority, which leads people astray, by deception, to worship the first beast (Rev 13:11–18).
The religious authorities in the first century AD led the Jews astray by giving glory to Emperor Caesar (John 19:15).
The future second beast can be any corrupt religious authority.

Revelation 13:13
The second beast raises up false prophets who deceive the people into following their teaching by performing miracles to lure the people towards them.\
We have already been warned by Moses, Jesus and Paul to be aware and beware of the false prophets (Deut. 13:1–4; Mathew 24:24; 2 Thess. 2:9–10).

Revelation 13:18
666, refers to humanity, created on the sixth day and brought into covenant with God on the seventh day, which God blessed as the Sabbath.
The early Christians referred to the evil and cruel emperors as the “anti-Christs” (1 John 2:18-22; 4:3; 2 John 1:7) therefore John had to be careful when referring to any of them.
Caesar Nero was one of the emperors who viciously persecuted the Church. Christians had either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom.  Peter and Paul were executed during the rule of Nero, before the destruction of the Temple.
The consonants in Nero's name add up to 666.\
The only other time the number 666 appears in the Bible is when Solomon turned away from God and started multiplying his wealth, women and weapons (1 Kings 10:14).
Therefore the final beast would probably be a combination of Solomon and Nero; In other words, the final beast (or anti-Christ) would be an evil, rich, womanizing, powerful and cruel ruler who will viciously persecute the Christians.

The number 666 is what “Nero Caesar” (NRWN QSR) adds up to in Hebrew and Aramaic according to the numerical values the letters have in these languages (N+R+W+N+Q+S+R = 50+200+6+50+100+60+200 = 666).

However, as long as we receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27) every Sunday and obey God’s commandments at all times, we will be covered by the Blood of the Lamb and Satan will not be able to destroy our souls, even if he succeeds in destroying our bodies.
Therefore let us stop worrying about the anti-Christ and focus more on the living Christ.

Revelation 14:1
In the old Covenant, the ordained Jewish priests had only the Father's name on their foreheads (Exodus 28:36-38; Exodus 29:6).
In the new Covenant, the Christian priests have the Father's and Son's name on their foreheads by virtue of their baptism.

Revelation 14:4-5
*It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins;*
These are the celibate priests who served God faithfully without getting involved with idolatory of any kind.  Therefore they were pure in body and soul.

*............ these follow the Lamb wherever he goes.*
They followed the Passover Lamb (Jesus) because wherever there is a Tabernacle there is an Apostolic priest.

*........... and in their mouth no lie was found; they are blameless.*
These are the godly priests who have abstained from women and who have preached the true Word of God and brought many people close to God (Malachi 2:4-7).

Revelation 14:12
In addition to faith in Jesus, Jesus insists upon the necessity and value of “good works” and obedience to God’s commandments even in the face of a crisis or any negative situation (Revelation 2:23; 20:12–13; 22:12; Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6).

Revelation 14:13
“Yes,” said the Spirit, “let them find rest from their labors, for their works accompany them.”
We will be judged by our faith and works, and when we enter into God's eternal rest we will rest from our works, because "entering into God's rest" means "our faith has been tested and we have proved our faith by our works" (Hebrews 4:10).

Hebrews 1:14
Christ is the centre of the angelic world.  They are His angels (Matthew 25:31).
They belong to Him because they were created through and for Him (Colossians 1:16) and specially because he has made them the messengers of his saving plan.

In the old Covenant, angels have been present since the beginning of creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from far or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan:

1. they closed the earthly paradise (Genesis 3:24);
2. they protected Lot (Genesis 19:15);
3. they saved Hagar and her child (Genesis 21:17);
4. they stayed Abraham's hand (Genesis 22:11);
5. they communicated the law by their ministry (Acts 7:53);
6. they led the People of God (Exodus 23:20-22);
7. they announced births and callings (Judges 13:3; 6:11-24);
8. they assisted the prophets (Isaiah 6:6; 1 Kings 19:5);
9. Angel Gabriel announced the birth of the fore runner and of Jesus Himself (Luke 1:11 & 26).

In the new Covenant, from the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate (Jesus) is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels:

1. When God "brought the firstborn into the world, He said, “Let all God's angels worship Him” (Hebrews 1:6.); thereafter their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise, "Glory to God in the highest" (Luke 2:14);
2. They saved Jesus and His mother from being deserted by Joseph (Matthew 1:20).
3. They protected Jesus in his infancy (Matthew 2:13 & 19-20);
4. They served him in the desert (Matthew 4:11; Mark 1:13);
5. They strengthened him while He was going through agony in the garden (Luke 22:43), when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies (Matthew 26:53) as Israel had been saved (2 Maccabees 10:29-30; 11:8).
6. It was the angels who "evangelized" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection (Luke 2:8-14; Mark 16:5-7).
   They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his Judgement (Matthew 13:41-42; 24:31; Luke 12:8-9; Acts 1:10-11).
   (CCC 331-336)

Hebrews 3:7-8
Whenever we harden our hearts (resist God by committing sins), like those Israelites,  we break the Covenant with God and automatically move into a Covenant with Satan.  God is calling us to repent and renew our Covenant with Him regularly so that we can be in a Covenant relation with Him (state of grace) every day, and if we die today we can directly enter into our eternal rest.
God lives outside of time, so for Him the Covenant was made through Jesus “today” and we belong to His Covenant family through baptism.

The two most important moments in our lives are:
(1) now, and
(2) at the hour of our death.

Let us therefore focus on God's Will and obey His commandments every moment of our present time so that we may remain strong in our faith until the hour of our death.

Hebrews 4:1-8
Here the author speaks of two types of spiritual rests.

One rest is when God rested on the seventh day from all His works after the creation of the world, and God invited humanity to join Him in that rest every Sabbath as a symbol of their eternal rest.

The second rest is the rest of the earthly promised land, which was a symbol of our heavenly promised land.  The earthly promised land was a physical place where the people could enter and have peace and safety if they obeyed God.  But the people of Israel sinned terribly, generation after generation, starting from the first generation of adults who passed through the Red Sea.  The Israelites never fully embraced the Covenant laws and therefore never enjoyed the promised peace and rest.

Like the Israelites, we too have been promised that same peace and rest till we reach our heavenly promised land if we obey God’s commandments and the teachings of Christ.  But we are on a better level than those ancient people, because in baptism Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit to help us enjoy that peace and rest on earth without struggling with our human efforts.  We just need to detach ourselves from the world, surrender ourselves to the Lord, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and spend moments of silence in solitude with the Holy Spirit without resisting the working of the Spirit in our lives so that we can have that peaceful relationship with God, the same bliss which was enjoyed by Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden before the fall.

Hebrews 4:9-10
The seventh day Sabbath rest (Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8-9) was to be a shadow of the Eternal rest for God’s people (Hebrews 4:9).  In the old Covenant it was Saturday, whereas in the new Covenant it is Sunday.

After completing His work of the first creation, God rested on the seventh day of the week (the Sabbath), blessed it and made it holy (Genesis 2:2-3).  It was supposed to be an everlasting Sabbath until sin entered the world.
Therefore, after the completion of His work for the salvation of mankind, Jesus (the first Adam) rested in the tomb on Holy Saturday, the seventh day of the week, in accordance with the Jewish Sabbath.\
His Sabbath rest indicated the end of the first / old creation.
The Resurrection of Jesus (the new Adam) on the first day of the week was the beginning of the new creation which has no end.
(CCC 624)
