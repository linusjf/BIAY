### Day 342 The real struggles of being a disciple of Christ.

When we read about the great miracles performed by the early disciples we can assume that they were able to do anything. But the disciples had real problems and suffering. They needed to be strong and endure the hardships that came their way.

We cause no one to stumble in anything, in order that no fault may be found with our ministry;
4 on the contrary, in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships, constraints,
5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts;
6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
7in truthful speech, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
8through glory and dishonor, insult and praise. We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
9as unrecognized and yet acknowledged; as dying and behold we live; as chastised and yet not put to death;
10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things. 2 Cor 6:3-10

The disciples had to endure so many hardships as listed above, that they were beaten and not respected. They were proclaiming the truth but were considered deceivers. They were chastised and put to death because they decided to preach Christ.
In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the church of their many sins. He prayed and hoped that they would change their lives for the Lord.
For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it; and if I did regret it (\[for\] I see that that letter saddened you, if only for a while),
9I rejoice now, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened into repentance; for you were saddened in a godly way, so that you did not suffer loss in anything because of us.

10For godly sorrow produces a salutary repentance without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death. 2 Cor 7:8-10

Paul‚Äôs suffering and struggle did not go in vain, his first letter bore good fruit. The church in Corinth repented and there is great rejoining in heaven when anyone repents.
Sometimes as parents or leaders, we should not hesitate to correct those in our care. We are responsible for their spiritual lives, we should tell people that they are wrong when needed.
Let us pray for all teachings, leaders, priests, parents, elders, or anyone in authority.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 342 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 21:13
*Then Paul replied, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.‚Äù*

The man who once took the life of a Christian because of his faith (Acts 7:58) was now ready to give his own life for the same faith.  One act of mercy from Stephen changed the life of Paul forever and brought thousands into the Church.
Paul's conversion should give us hope that if we forgive our persecutors and pray for them, it is possible that they will repent and accept Christ some day.\
However sinful a person may be, God can convert anyone anytime and use them for His glory.

Therefore, while we make sure to pray for our brothers and sisters who are victims of persecution, let us not forget to pray for the conversion of the persecutors.

2 Corinthians 6:2
*For he says: ‚ÄúIn an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.‚Äù  Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.*
For us, the day of salvation is not what happened 2000 years ago.  For us, the day of salvation is "today" because we are members of the Body of Christ.
We ask the Lord to give us our new Manna "today" (Matthew 6:11) so that we can consume it ‚Äútoday‚Äù because if we keep it for the next day it will rot (Exodus 16:19-20).\
We are building bridges, not walls.

2 Corinthians 6:16‚Äì18
*We are the temple of the living God; as God said, ‚ÄúI will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  Therefore, come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters.‚Äù*

This promise was made to the Israelites (Leviticus 26:11-12; Ezekiel 20:41) but now it is only for the Christians (Jewish and non-Jewish).

When we receive the Body of Christ (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) we receive divine life and thus we become temples of the living God because God will live in us until we commit a mortal sin.

2 Corinthians 7:10
*For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.*
True godly sorrow is sorrow over having wounded and broken God‚Äôs heart with our sins.  The Holy Spirit will bring out that sorrow.  We cannot truly repent without the Holy Spirit convicting us of our sin.

Trying to appear repentant and sorrowful to escape the consequences of our wrong doings in this world, after being caught, is not true repentance.\
Repenting and confessing sins without the feeling of guilt, just to keep out of Hell, is also not true repentance.\
Those are all types of worldly sorrow.

When we realize just how much God loves us, and when we feel the pain that Jesus felt during His passion for our sins, the Holy Spirit will make that awareness come to us and cause us to grieve. It is more like a rebellious young man in a prison cell reflecting on how he hurt and disgraced his parents and siblings by committing a crime; that is godly sorrow.  It is the sorrow that comes from our heart.

2 Corinthians 8:9
*For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.*
Jesus was rich when He was divine but He became a poor human so that by receiving Him into our bodies in a state of grace we can share in His divine nature.  In other words, Jesus in His generosity gave up His divinity to make us spiritually rich.\
Likewise, in imitation of Christ, we too must give up all our earthly comfort and luxury and lead simple lives so that we can give our excess to the poor to help raise them up to our level (Acts 4:34-35).

Thus we can gradually erase poverty with our generosity.
