### Day 346 The Fruit of the Spirit

Just as a tree is known by its fruit, a disciple of Jesus is known by their fruits.

In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.Gal 5:22-23

We could spend hours going over each of these fruits and we should ponder on each of these each day. We can use the fruits of the Spirit to examine our conscience every night, check if we loved enough, had joy in our trials, keep the peace, were kind to strangers, generous to those in need, faithful to God, family and friends, did we have self-control on our senses? I‚Äôm sure we all will feel that we are lacking in some area or the other.
So how do we grow more fruit? The answer is simple we need to nourish the tree. We nourish ourselves with the Sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist, we prune dead branches at the sacrament of reconciliation. The trees need the sun to live so do we, we need the ‚ÄúSon‚Äù to live. Personal prayer and Bible reading are a critical part of our nourishment as well. Also trees stay together in a forest so they can withstand gusty winds and other elements, we likewise need the love of a community to grown and be strong.
Most important thing for a tree is water, we need the living waters ‚Äì the Holy Spirit to thrive.

For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want. But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Gal 5:17-18

If we want to bear fruit we need to be guided by the Holy Spirit, we just cannot do what the flesh desires. The desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit. The works of the flesh can drag us down and stunt our growth.

Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,
20idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,
21occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Gal 5:19-21

Let us steer clear of the above traps of the flesh and be led by the Holy Spirit. If we can focus on leading a holy life, a life led and guided by the Holy Spirit the fruit of the Spirit will automatically grow and people will take joy in our presence. People will be drawn to us when they see the love, joy, peace, patience‚Ä¶..

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
