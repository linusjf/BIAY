### Day 347 Promises & Blessings from Ephesians 1

Sometime the best thing to do is read and ponder on the Bible. Let us do just that as we read the promises and blessings from Ephesians 1.

4 God choose us in Christ before the creation of the world

5 From Eternity he destined us in love to be his adopted sons and daughters in Christ

7 in Christ we obtain freedom, sealed by His blood
have forgiveness of sins greatness of his grace he lavishes on us

14 We were sealed by the Holy Spirit

17 May God reveal himself to you & give you a spirit of wisdom & revelation

18 May he enlighten your inner vision
May we know how great the inheritance, the glory, God sets apart for us

19 May we understand with what extraordinary power he acts in favor of us who believe

20 Jesus Christ is above all rule, power, authority, dominion or any supernatural force that could be named

22 God put all things under his feet, Christ is the head we are the body.

Let us Pray: Lord Jesus, reveal your self to me and may I experience the greatness of your grace. Thank you for working in my favor with extraordinary power. I submit my life at your feet Lord, lead me Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 347 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 26:14
*"It hurts you to kick against the goads (spikes)."*

This is a Greek proverb about useless and harmful resistance, well understood by the farmers. Stubborn yoked oxen that kick against the plowman will only hurt themselves on the goads (sharp spikes) behind them.

Jesus had told Paul that Paul’s resistance to the Gospel was futile to the point of being personally harmed.

This is true, not only for Paul, but for every human, Christian and non-Christian.
It is possible that a Christian can reject the Gospel some time after he is baptized, if he desires to follow another faith, either because he is threatened or offered some benefits or for any other reason.

Acts 26:32
*And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”*

Paul appealed to the emperor (Caesar), not because he wanted to be set free but because he had a strong desire to preach the Gospel to Caesar (Acts 28:xxxxx).\
Do we have that kind of passion to spread the Gospel even when times are bad for us?
