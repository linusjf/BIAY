### Day 347 Promises & Blessings from Ephesians 1

Sometime the best thing to do is read and ponder on the Bible. Let us do just that as we read the promises and blessings from Ephesians 1.

4 God choose us in Christ before the creation of the world

5 From Eternity he destined us in love to be his adopted sons and daughters in Christ

7 in Christ we obtain freedom, sealed by His blood
have forgiveness of sins greatness of his grace he lavishes on us

14 We were sealed by the Holy Spirit

17 May God reveal himself to you & give you a spirit of wisdom & revelation

18 May he enlighten your inner vision
May we know how great the inheritance, the glory, God sets apart for us

19 May we understand with what extraordinary power he acts in favor of us who believe

20 Jesus Christ is above all rule, power, authority, dominion or any supernatural force that could be named

22 God put all things under his feet, Christ is the head we are the body.

Let us Pray: Lord Jesus, reveal your self to me and may I experience the greatness of your grace. Thank you for working in my favor with extraordinary power. I submit my life at your feet Lord, lead me Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
