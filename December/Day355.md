### Day 355 If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive

One lie of the devil that is spreading rapidly in our younger generation is indifference to God/Religion and relativism. Many people say your truth is your truth and mine is mine. When we have our own standards instead of the standards of God, the concept of sin disappears.

Let us be reminded that we all have sinned and fallen short of God‚Äôs glory. If we say we have no sin then we make God to be a liar.

If we say, ‚ÄúWe are without sin,‚Äù we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
9If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
10If we say, ‚ÄúWe have not sinned,‚Äù we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 Jh 1:8-10

And for those who follow Christ, we need to be in the light and follow his commandments. This will guarantee that we know Christ if we keep his commandments.

The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep his commandments. Whoever says, ‚ÄúI know him,‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1 John 2:3-4

We ought to demonstrate our love for Christ by loving our earthly brothers and sisters.
Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness.
10Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. 1 Jh 3:9-10

The world will know us by the love we show to our brothers and sisters. If we say we love God but hate our brother then we are liars and we are not walking in the light.
Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16For all that is in the world, sensual lust, enticement for the eyes, and a pretentious life, is not from the Father but is from the world.
17Yet the world and its enticement are passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains forever 1 Jh 2:15-17

We should not love the things of the world as they are passing away. The world with all its glitter and temporary satisfaction will not fulfill our desires. The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life are all passing away. Let us only focus on love of the Lord and his commands. Let us not lust over our brothers and sisters but love them instead. The path to holiness is to humble ourselves instead of walking around proud and pretending to be great. Let us hold to the highest standard of holiness, which is love. Love our brothers and sisters as Christ loved us.

Let us not fear but repent for If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.2 Th 3:5

May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 355 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 1:8
*If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.*

Sin is not only about robbing a bank or murdering someone or committing adultery.
Due to the fall of man our love for one another has become so distorted that we are not able to love one another without conditions and most of the time we ignore the needy ones.  This distorted love causes us to constantly commit sins in our daily lives, by gossiping, complaining, showing off, talking too much, criticizing, insulting, humiliating, abusive language, etc. etc.  All these are the result of lack of love in our hearts for the people around us and thus, in following these habits, we disobey the new Commandment given to us by Jesus (John 15:12).

Therefore, knowing the weakness of our souls, God sent His Son to give us the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that, whenever we become aware of our sins, we can repent and renew the broken Covenant by confessing our personal sins (1 John 1:9) and receiving the sacrament (John 20:23).  Thereafter we can make atonement for those sins and share in the sacrificial meal so that we can have communion with God once again (John 6:54).

1 John 1:9
If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.\
In the history of salvation, God was not content only to redeem Israel from physical bondage by bringing them out of Egypt (Deut. 5:6) because the people constantly attached themselves to a sinful lifestyle (idolatory, immorality, etc.) and God does not want anyone worshipping Him when they are held in bondage.  Therefore, after redeeming them God saved them from their personal sins by forgiving the sins (Leviticus 4:20b, 26b, 31b & 35b; 5:10b, 13a, 16b & 18; 6:7) which were confessed to Him in the presence of the priest (Leviticus 5:5) who would then make atonement for their sins on their behalf (Leviticus 5:6), to purify them symbolically, because sin is always an offence against God, and only He can forgive it.

After the mortal sin of the first Adam, all humans were destined to go to Hell because nothing unclean must enter Heaven (Revelation 21:27.  But God had a redemption plan in place, therefore, the souls of all the deceased righteous ones were preserved in Purgatory/Sheol (Numbers 20:26; 27:13; Luke 16:25).  By shedding His Blood on the Cross, Jesus redeemed all the deceased righteous people of the old Covenant (Mark 3:27; 1 Peter 3:19-20).

In the new Covenant, however, we are redeemed / released from Satan when we are baptized.

But God was not content only to redeem us.   He knows that, due to the weakness of our souls, we are definitely going to break the Covenant over and over again by committing sins between our baptism and our death and He wants us to maintain our baptismal holiness as long as we live. Therefore, He gave us the purification Sacrament.

So now, if we confess our sins as mandated by God (Leviticus 6:7), He will forgive us our sins and renew the Covenant (John 20:23) which we broke with our sins because confession is not complete until the broken Covenant is renewed, atonement is made for the offense and we take part in the sacrificial meal so that we can once again have communion with God.

Meanwhile, all sins confessed with remorse in our hearts, will be forgiven by God (Leviticus 6:7) except sins which are retained by the priest as permitted by Jesus (John 20:23).

1 John 3:1-3
*See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are.  Beloved, we are God‚Äôs children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.*

Through baptism, God has given us the privilege of being called ‚ÄúHis children.‚Äù  Therefore, we must live our lives like children of God and not like children of Satan.
Saints in Heaven will be able to see Jesus as he is, that is, in His glorious state (beatific vision) (Matthew 5:8) because they will be part-takers of God‚Äôs divine nature.  But to be able to take part in God‚Äôs divine nature we must repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly, so that we may die in a state of grace, that is, in a Covenant relation with God.  Further purification, if required, will be done in Purgatory.

1 John 3:18
*Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.*

God does not want our lip service.  He wants us to prove our love for Him by the way we live our lives, that is, by loving one another without conditions, specially by caring for and sharing with the needy ones.

We don't do any good by sympathizing with the suffering people around us and asking others to help them, if we are not making any attempt to help ease their suffering ourselves.  If we genuinely cannot give them financial support, we can at least give them physical support and pray for them.

If we become aware of someone who is in need of help, it is not by accident.  It is God making us aware because He wants to use our hands to help them.

1 John 3:19-20
*And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.*

Sometimes in the past, when we were angry or extremely annoyed, we may have said or done something that had hurt or damaged someone, severely.  But even after we confessed our sin and we were forgiven, our conscience still torments us because of how we hurt that person.  John assures us that God is aware whether we have truly repented for our sinful behavior or whether we have confessed our sin for other reasons.\
We may succeed in fooling humans / the priests but we can't fool God.

2 Thessalonians 2:15
*Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught, which you received either by word or by a letter of ours.*
The Church didn't have a Bible in hand until the end of the third century AD.  Therefore, the written Tradition which Paul was referring to were all the epistles which he had written to the Christians to correct their errors, discipline them, etc.\
The oral Tradition was however handed down through their successors.
