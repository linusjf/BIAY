### Day 352 Suffering unjustly

Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.1 Pet 2:18

Most people are either complaining about work or their boss, mostly for the right reasons. Bosses can be very hard to deal with as some of them are really corrupt, they are seeking their own gain. However, as Christians, we should be subject to them whether they are good or bad. Now does Jesus want us to be always under the yoke of hard work, absolutely not. God will give you the right job and boss to benefit you. We should always pray for our boss and job and do it to the best of our ability, God will bless us and we will find fulfillment for the dignity of work comes from God.

For whenever anyone bears the pain of unjust suffering because of the consciousness of God, that is a grace.

20But what credit is there if you are patient when beaten for doing wrong? But if you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good, this is a grace before God.
21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps. 1 Pet 2:19-22

If we suffer unjustly because of the consciousness of God we can rest assured we are under grace. God will give us the strength to suffer because Jesus suffered unjustly and set an example for us.
‚ÄúHe committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.‚Äù When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly. 1Pet 2:22-23

So whether we suffer justly or unjustly let us remember to unite our suffering to the suffering of Jesus. When we unite our suffering to Jesus‚Äô suffering our suffering becomes redemptive and we receive a blessing, in fact it is a privilege to suffer unjustly. However if we only suffer unjustly then it may turn to abuse, so we need to make people aware if they treat you poorly. Take a stand for what is right, but also accept your cross until the time it is resolved.

May the Holy Spirit lead üôè
