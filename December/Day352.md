### Day 352 Suffering unjustly

Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.1 Pet 2:18

Most people are either complaining about work or their boss, mostly for the right reasons. Bosses can be very hard to deal with as some of them are really corrupt, they are seeking their own gain. However, as Christians, we should be subject to them whether they are good or bad. Now does Jesus want us to be always under the yoke of hard work, absolutely not. God will give you the right job and boss to benefit you. We should always pray for our boss and job and do it to the best of our ability, God will bless us and we will find fulfillment for the dignity of work comes from God.

For whenever anyone bears the pain of unjust suffering because of the consciousness of God, that is a grace.

20But what credit is there if you are patient when beaten for doing wrong? But if you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good, this is a grace before God.
21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps. 1 Pet 2:19-22

If we suffer unjustly because of the consciousness of God we can rest assured we are under grace. God will give us the strength to suffer because Jesus suffered unjustly and set an example for us.
‚ÄúHe committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.‚Äù When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly. 1Pet 2:22-23

So whether we suffer justly or unjustly let us remember to unite our suffering to the suffering of Jesus. When we unite our suffering to Jesus‚Äô suffering our suffering becomes redemptive and we receive a blessing, in fact it is a privilege to suffer unjustly. However if we only suffer unjustly then it may turn to abuse, so we need to make people aware if they treat you poorly. Take a stand for what is right, but also accept your cross until the time it is resolved.

May the Holy Spirit lead üôè

### BIAY Day 352 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 2:20-25
Circumcision was meant only for the natural male descendants of Abraham but Baptism is meant for everyone, old and young, Jews and gentiles.  God wants every human to belong to His family from the 8th day of their birth so that they can be brought into a relationship with Him and thereby start receiving sanctifying graces.

In the old Covenant all male descendants of Abraham had to be circumcised on the 8th day of their birth even though the old Covenant could not sanctify their souls.
But the new Covenant is more powerful than the old one, and therefore Peter extends the invitation for baptism to adults and children alike, so that they can be brought into the new Covenant without delay.

Three thousand were baptized after hearing Peter's sermon because Peter spoke with the power of the Holy Spirit.

*By his stripes we are healed.*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus we are spiritually and physically healed, but the carrying out of that healing process happens in different ways and at different times.
Original sin is cleansed and we are restored to a state of sanctifying grace through baptism. Our souls are redeemed but our bodies are not.  And even our souls are not immediately restored and perfected.  The disorder of concupiscence remains, that is, the "fomes peccati" (in Latin) or ‚Äútendency to sin‚Äù that afflicts us until we attain our ultimate goal of final salvation at the end of our lives.

The sanctifying graces which we receive through the sacraments are not only a source of healing and restoration, but they are a summons to spiritual battle.  They enter us into our time of testing that will lead us to our full and final redemption, that will include not only the full and final redemption of our souls, but also "the redemption of our bodies" (Romans 8:23), but only if we are faithful unto death (Revelation 2:10).

Why?
That is because our bodies are not redeemed yet in any sense. This is unlike our souls that have already experienced redemption, but are in a process of redemption / salvation / justification that will reach its completion at the end of life.

When God chooses to heal our bodies, whenever we are physically sick, that is also a participation in the healing that came to us through the Cross.  But it is temporary and points to the more important healing of the soul, as we see in the case of the paralytic when Jesus healed the soul first and then the body (Matthew 9:2-6). The ultimate and absolute healing of the body comes only at the end of time for all humans, with the exception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who did not need any healing of body and soul.

In other words, it means that the healing is not automatic. The healing medicine was prepared by Jesus, spiritually, when He received all His wounds during His passion and death, and also by the holy life He led, but since the time of the Resurrection it has been made available to us for our healing, first during Baptism and thereafter only when we pray and when we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, during which time physical healing may or may not happen but spiritual healing definitely happens.

Colossians 3:5-10
Old person / old self / old man refers to the first Adam and new person / new self / new man refers to the new Adam (Jesus).
The first Adam's sin caused humanity to receive damaged souls which weakened our conscience and therefore we fall into temptations easily.
The new Adam (Jesus) gave us a renewable Covenant so that we, who are baptized, can renew the Covenant whenever we break it, thereby allowing us to restore the divine life within us which gives us the spiritual strength to resist evil and keeps us ready for eternal life.
Our fallen nature can accept evil without any effort, but to resist evil we need spiritual strength which is powerful and we get that power from the sacraments.

Colossians 3:12-21
Divine authority is reflected in human authority. We have 3 persons in the Trinity with God the Father above all but all three are always in unity with each other. Authority does not mean that the subordinates must be misused or abused by their superiors. Authoritative positions are given to us by God so that we can serve others, and not to expect the subordinates to serve us.  Subordinates are given to us by God to assist us in serving others.

An authoritative position gives the person the authority to make rules to enforce discipline, to ensure that everyone obeys the rules, to deal with those who violate rules, to make decisions, to organize things, etc. whether it is in a household, in the Church, at our work place, etc.

By humbling Himself and washing the feet of His disciples (John 13:5), Jesus, the King of all kings, gave us an example of how a person in authority must act.  Let us follow His example.
