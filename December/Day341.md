### Day 341 We walk by faith, not by sight.

The Christian life is a life of dependence on God, we may not know God‚Äôs plan for us but we trust Him fully. We do not go by what we see but walk by faith, knowing that the God who created us will take care of us. We may feel abandoned or alone on this journey especially when we are going through the trials of life. Let us rest assured that Jesus is walking with us and is carrying us.

‚ÄúWe walk by faith, not by sight.‚Äù 2corinthians 5:5
We will face many challenges in life, we may feel as though we are crushed but we will rise again in the strength of the Lord.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;
2 Cor 4:8-9

Although we may seem persecuted, afflicted and struck down, we should have faith and we God will make a way out for us. We will never be constrained or driven to despair or destroyed. We will rise up with wings as eagles and our strength will be renewed. The Lord Himself will hold our hands and lift us up. When we are weak He is strong.
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.

11For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 2 Cor 4:10-11

When we suffer, we suffer with Christ, He is the head and we are the body. But our suffering will bring new life in heaven. Our suffering takes on a new meaning when we unite our suffering with Christ's suffering for the salvation of the world.
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence. 2 Cor 4: 14

Our suffering will not be in vain the Holy Spirit will raise us up into the presence of Jesus.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
