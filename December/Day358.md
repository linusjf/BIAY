### Day 358  St Michael the ArchAngel protect us

In today’s reading we see St Michael come up.
Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment\* upon him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” Jude 1:9

St Michael the Archangel comes up a few other times in Daniel and the book of the revelations to mention a few. St Michael is also attributed with the angel in the garden of eden and the angel that led the Isrealites in the desert. Catholic tradition also attributes St Michael of taking Mother Mary to Heaven when her time on earth was over.
St Michael is considered the guarding of the Church as he is always seen fighting and defending the church.
The popular prayer (below) to St Michael the Archangel is condensed from the prayer Pope Leo XIII wrote in 1886 when he had that horrific vision of the demonic spirits gathering on the eternal city (Rome) and Satan threatening to destroy the church in 100 years.
Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel:
"St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen"
This prayer is a very powerful prayer that we should include in our daily devotions, pray it in the morning, on your commute, over your children, over the sick, over those who are in danger of death, for protections against temptations, for physical and spiritual protections from the evil one.
St. Michael the Archangel has always been known to be a powerful intercessor against evil, especially since he is recorded in the Book of Revelation as, “fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven” (Revelation 12:7-9). Based on this episode in scripture, St. Michael is frequently depicted in art thrusting a lance, spear or sword into Satan, who is often depicted as a serpent or dragon.
Let us not fail to invoke the protection of St Michael the archangel everyday.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
