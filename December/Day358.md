### Day 358  St Michael the ArchAngel protect us

In today’s reading we see St Michael come up.
Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment\* upon him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!” Jude 1:9

St Michael the Archangel comes up a few other times in Daniel and the book of the revelations to mention a few. St Michael is also attributed with the angel in the garden of eden and the angel that led the Isrealites in the desert. Catholic tradition also attributes St Michael of taking Mother Mary to Heaven when her time on earth was over.
St Michael is considered the guarding of the Church as he is always seen fighting and defending the church.
The popular prayer (below) to St Michael the Archangel is condensed from the prayer Pope Leo XIII wrote in 1886 when he had that horrific vision of the demonic spirits gathering on the eternal city (Rome) and Satan threatening to destroy the church in 100 years.
Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel:
"St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen"
This prayer is a very powerful prayer that we should include in our daily devotions, pray it in the morning, on your commute, over your children, over the sick, over those who are in danger of death, for protections against temptations, for physical and spiritual protections from the evil one.
St. Michael the Archangel has always been known to be a powerful intercessor against evil, especially since he is recorded in the Book of Revelation as, “fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven” (Revelation 12:7-9). Based on this episode in scripture, St. Michael is frequently depicted in art thrusting a lance, spear or sword into Satan, who is often depicted as a serpent or dragon.
Let us not fail to invoke the protection of St Michael the archangel everyday.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 358 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jude 1:9
*But when the archangel Michael argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, Michael did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him but said, “May the Lord rebuke you!”*

If an Archangel refrained from reviling the devil, then it is even more wrong for mere humans to revile the angels or any of God’s creation, irrespective of whether they are good or bad.

God sends rain and sunshine on the good as well as on the evil (Mathew 5:45), because in God’s eyes we are all His children and we are all equal.  Even the bad angels were created by God therefore we don’t please God when we revile or speak ill of the bad angels or bad people.  Instead, when we revile the bad ones we are actually making a Covenant with Satan to fight with his devils, and Michael was aware of this.
God wills that everyone should be saved (1 Timothy 2:4-5), therefore, instead of being judgemental about those who have gone away from God, let us help them to come back to God.

Normally Satan is always interested in claiming souls of the dead but this time he was interested in the body of the dead.

It is not clear why Satan was interested in the body of Moses but Satan does not have the power to use the bodies of the dead because he would have to resurrect those bodies in order to use them and that requires infinite power which he does not have. Only God can truly raise the dead.

Satan is, however, constantly trying to stop God’s will from being executed in the world.  Therefore, most likely, he would either have been given the knowledge that God has a special plan for the body of Moses or he may have guessed it because of the angelic activity that would have surrounded the body of Moses along with Michael.\
Moses, eventually, did appear during the transfiguration of Jesus, which was witnessed by three of the apostles.

Jude 1:11
*Woe to them! They followed the way of Cain, abandoned themselves to Balaam’s error for the sake of gain, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.*

*What was Korah’s rebellion?*
Korah was a non-ordained Levite, but his 250 men were not even Levites and yet they all claimed that they too were holy and could offer the sacrifices relegated to the priesthood (Numbers 16:3), even though they were not called by God for the priesthood.  By protesting against Moses and Aaron who were God’s anointed people, they were protesting against God.  Therefore the earth opened up and swallowed them and thus they all perished physically.

Jude did not write to the Jews but to Christians and warned us not to claim what is not allowed to us.  We are required to carry out whatever mission God has assigned to us even if it has no significance.  Whatever mission we carry out on earth is all part of God’s plan therefore we must not be picky and choosey about what we are expected to do.  If we protest against God’s anointed people, we will perish spiritually (Hell).

Cain was envious of his own brother and therefore killed him.
Balaam was given supernatural power but he used his gift to fill his pockets.

Let us not imitate any of these three men.

2 Timothy 1:1-7
Paul had developed a very close friendship with Timothy who was also very active in the Church and someone whom Paul could entrust with the preaching of the Gospel.

It is very important for us to have friends who walk with us towards God.

Timothy learnt about the faith from his mother and grandmother.

It is important for us to live our faith as true Christians so that the next generation will see our fidelity to Christ and pass that on to their future generations.

Paul was writing from prison and at that time Timothy may have not felt confident enough, on his own, to handle the negative issues that the Church has to constantly face.  But Timothy was going to be Paul's successor therefore Paul was writing words of encouragement to Timothy that by his ordination he received a Spirit of power, not of fear. Therefore Timothy was required to stir up the Holy Spirit, boldly face the attacks of the evil one, whether physical or spiritual, and stand for the truth, while maintaining his own holiness, even if it meant that he had to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

But this advice was not only for Timothy.

When we receive the Holy Spirit through the sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, etc.) we are required to obey God and pray to the Holy Spirit every day to help us keep His flame burning in us always, as long as we live, so that we can be instrumental in making Christ known to the people around us by the way we live our Christian lives, even if we have to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

*For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands;*
By the power of God invested in them through their ordination, the Bishops and priests bring God's graces to their congregations in a special and reverent way, through the sacraments.

*For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but a spirit of power and love and self-control.*
The Lord will always give us the love and self-control we need to bear our share of hardship for the Gospel, with a strength that can come from God alone.
Our task is to continue doing what He has commanded, to love and to build up His kingdom.

2 Timothy 2:14-19
It is not wrong to be a good public speaker but using that talent to mislead people and take them away from God for selfish reasons is wrong.

2 Timothy 1:8-10
Paul was addressing Timothy but this epistle is valid for Christians of all times.
Many of the first century Jewish Christians believed that when a person becomes a Christian he will be free of suffering, because it was the ancient belief in Israel that suffering is caused by the sins of either the suffering person or his parents (John 9:2).  They were probably of the opinion that baptism will wash away all the sins of their lifetime (past, present and future).  But the reality is different.

Suffering is not always caused by our sins.  Sometimes we have to suffer because of our faith in Christ.\
By our baptism we are adopted into God’s family and we become missionaries of Christ to help in the growth of the Church (the Kingdom of God on earth).  But we cannot become members of God’s family unless we are sinless, and baptism washes away all past sins including original sin, but not our future sins.

According to God’s initial divine plan, man and woman were to increase and multiply and fill the earth (Genesis 1:28).  At that point the earth was sanctified and man & woman were holy and full of grace.  Therefore, man & woman were given the responsibility to fill the earth and worship God on earth, as it is in Heaven, until it was time for man & woman and all their progeny to go to God.  But when sin entered the world God had to alter His divine plan.

Therefore Baptism is not the result of our works.  It is a gift from God to save us from eternal punishment by entering His Kingdom on earth (the Church) and preparing ourselves to have communion with Him for eternity by worshipping Him in a state of grace and growing in holiness through the sacraments, while we also busy ourselves with the growth of His Kingdom on earth by filling the Church with souls.

This means, after we are baptized we must be willing to share the suffering of Christ even to the point of death, because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there’s strong resistance from the demonic, and that is because sin still exists in the world.  Jesus came to earth to divinize the world with His touch, but because of sin He had to suffer, shed His Blood and taste death.

Paul was reminding Timothy, and us, to take our share of suffering for the Gospel (or “good news”) because each individual Christian, as a member of the Body of Christ, has a share in the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ for the sake of the Gospel.
Paul used the word “Gospel” to refer to the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.\
We are called to the faith by a Holy Calling, through the grace of baptism, the very reason for which we were created.

2 Timothy 2:8-13
In baptism, Christians die spiritually with Christ and hope to live with him and reign with him forever, but Christian life includes endurance, witness, and even suffering, as Paul’s own case makes clear; while he is bound by chains in prison, for preaching the Gospel (2 Timothy 2:9), he continues teaching his people because the Word of God is not chained.  By his example he shows us that nothing should stop us from our love for God and sharing the Word of God with others (Romans 8:35-37).   Therefore Paul’s sufferings are helpful to the elect for obtaining the salvation and glory available in Christ (2 Timothy 2:10), who will be true to those who are faithful even through suffering, and will disown those who deny him (2 Timothy 2:12).
