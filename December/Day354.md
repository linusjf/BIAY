### Day 354 Always Rejoice, Pray and Give Thanks

If you want to live like a disciple you ought to follow these three

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks

Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing.In all circumstances give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-27

It could not be stated any more clearly, that it‚Äôs the will of God for us to always rejoice, pray without ceasing, and give thanks to God in all circumstances.
If it‚Äôs the will of God for us to rejoice always then why is there so much suffering in our lives? Our joy is not mere happiness based on our circumstances, but the inner joy with the knowledge that God is in control of every situation. The rejoicing comes when we count it a blessing to suffer with Christ for the redemption of the world. When we are persecuted for the sake of the Kingdom we count it Joy.

Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you \[falsely\] because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Mat 5:10-12

We are called to rejoice when evil is done against us because of our walk as Christians. Like we read in St Paul‚Äôs letter to the Philippians a few days ago, from his prison cell St Paul asks us to Rejoice. He says it twice, again I say rejoice.

Rejoice in the Lord always. I shall say it again: rejoice!
5Your kindness should be known to all. The Lord is near.
6Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.
7Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Have no anxiety at all, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, may your request be known to God.

We should pray always knowing that God will answer our prayer. Actually Thank God as soon as you pray, even before you receive what you want, Thank God for the blessing that He will bestow on you soon. We may feel that God is not answering our prayer but let us remember it is not for God‚Äôs benefit that it‚Äôs taking time but for our own benefit.
But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day.

The Lord does not delay his promise, as some regard ‚Äúdelay,‚Äù but he is patient with you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. 2 Pet 3:9

Although the above scripture is about Jesus‚Äô second coming we can also apply it to our prayer petitions. Even if it seems like a thousand years let us know that God has a plan. So let us be peaceful with the peace that surpasses understanding, thanking God for all the answered prayers and for future blessings. Praying always in the Spirit, using the gift of tongues, with the full armor of God, using the sword of the Spirit the word of God to fight off any anxiety and worry.

Let us always:

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks
   ‚Äúfor this is the will of God.‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
