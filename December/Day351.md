### Day 351 Words have power

We need to remember that our words have power because we are children of God. God created everything with just a word, ‚Äúlet there be light.‚Äù James reminds us that we who are teachers should realize that we speak God‚Äôs word and hence have to avoid any other bad speech.
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,
2for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also. James 3:1,2

There are 3 striking examples given to demonstrate the importance of the good use of the tongue.

1. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.
2. It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot‚Äôs inclination wishes.
3. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.
   For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
   8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. James 3:3-8

It is very hard as to tame the tongue, we can easily slander, gossip, lie, curse, speak rudely, angry words, insults‚Ä¶ Let us pray for the grace to control our tongue, so we will have the strength to control the whole body.
If we take some time to ponder on our speech we may fell as though we are hugging a cactus. But we have to come to terms with reality and draw near to God, for only with God‚Äôs strength can we control our tongue.

Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds.
9Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.
10Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you. James 4:8-10

As we draw near to God we come to a realization of our sin and want to cleanse our hands, hearts and tongue. If we humble ourselves before the Lord, Jesus will lift us up.
Let all our words be holy and positive, for our words have power. Let us speak blessings on our children everyday. Let praise be on our lips all the days of our life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
