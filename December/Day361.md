### Day 361: A second chance

We listened to the letter of St Paul to Philemon today and it’s a very short book it has just one chapter. Most of the chapter is written about Onesimus, St Paul is asking Philemon to give Onesimus a second chance in life.
Philemon was a wealthy Chritian and a just man. Onesimus was his slave, remember slavery wasn’t forced but mutually accepted back in the day just like our modern day job contract. Onesimus was probably a useless slave and possibly did something wrong to Philemon or did not fulfill his duties. It’s possible that Philemon sent him to jail or the Onesimus ran away and got into trouble, for our context it really does not matter.
Onesimus encountered Paul in the prison and received the gospel, he then became very helpful to Paul. In the letter to Philemon we read that Paul wanted to keep Onesimus with him as he was a great help in Paul’s old age, however Paul wanted to send him back to Philemon so Onesimus can fulfil his duty and be justified fully. Let us read the section of this letter as it’s beautifully written.

For I have experienced much joy and encouragement\* from your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed by you, brother.
Therefore, although I have the full right\* in Christ to order you to do what is proper,
I rather urge you out of love, being as I am, Paul, an old man,\* and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus. I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment, who was once useless to you but is now useful\* to \[both\] you and me.
I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.
I should have liked to retain him for myself, so that he might serve\* me on your behalf in my imprisonment for the gospel,
but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that the good you do might not be forced but voluntary.
Perhaps this is why he was away from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man\* and in the Lord.
So if you regard me as a partner, welcome him as you would me.
And if he has done you any injustice or owes you anything, charge it to me.
I, Paul, write this in my own hand: I will pay. May I not tell you that you owe me your very self.
Yes, brother, may I profit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
With trust in your compliance I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
At the same time prepare a guest room for me, for I hope to be granted to you through your prayers.   Philemon 1: 7-22
I wish and hope that everyone who needs a second chance in life finds a St Paul to lead and guide them. Also we should never write off anyone, but always know that Jesus can change their lives in ways we least expect it. Even if they are in jail like Onesimus there is still a chance that they can convert their lives, the gospel is not bound. Also we should pray for those involved in prison ministry, that they may have the patience and strength to minister to the inmates. Remember Jesus’ words in Mat 25:36 "I was in prison, and you came to me". Giving someone a second chance is really hard especially if they hurt us, we cannot rely on our own strength here but only on God’s grace. Forgiving close family members like a spouse, parent or child is extremely difficult but pray and give them a second chance not just once but 70 times 7.

May the Holy Spirit lead us
