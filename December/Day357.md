### Day 357 The love of money is the root of all evils

We live in a very materialistic world and people try to buy themselves out of all problems. This approach will never leave anyone fulfilled. Money can’t buy you everything in fact the more money one has the more one wants to get. Many people have spent their whole lives trying to be successful and end up so sick that they can’t even enjoy the money they saved.
For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. 1 Tim 6:10

We see people working multiple jobs to make it big in life, constantly thinking of how to make more money. This has caused them to skip Mass and other important spiritual activities. This also has drawn people away from family life. We see many young couples not wanting kids because they want a successful career. Let us stop for a moment and think what if we gain the whole world but lose our soul.
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction. 1 Tim 6:9

For we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it. 1 Tim 6:7

Let us remember that we came in empty-handed into this world and we will take nothing back with us.
Alexander the Great who conquered most of the world said “With my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I want people to know that I came empty-handed into this world and likewise will go empty-handed from this world.”
Let us learn from Alexander the Great that when we die we take nothing with us.
Let us learn from the rich people who commit suicide due to depression that money does not buy everything.
In fact, the more money we give away for a good cause, the happier we feel. The other extreme is also dangerous, where people don’t want to spend anything on themselves.
When we give we should be smart in giving, as some people are in the habit of taking money and having a good time. Like beggars who only beg to have their next drink or joint.
There are also lazy and greedy people in this world who would take money even though they are not truly in need.
In the early church, some widows were probably taking advantage of the church’s generosity. The apostles had to become prudent about who gets aid and who does not.
If any woman believer has widowed relatives, she must assist them; the church is not to be burdened so that it will be able to help those who are truly widows. 1 Tim 5:16

So the next time you think of giving someone money, pray about it and try to use sound judgment. Give to those who are in need and will really use it. For example, you may want to give food instead of money to a drunk.
The Lord will bless us with good finances if we don’t run after money. Seek first His kingdom and all things will be added to you.
The right use of money is essential.
7Tell the rich in the present age not to be proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing as wealth but rather on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.
18Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, ready to share,
19thus accumulating as treasure a good foundation for the future, so as to win the life that is true life. 1 Tim 6:17-19

Our goal is eternal life, money will come and money will go, but our soul will live forever.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
