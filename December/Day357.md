### Day 357 The love of money is the root of all evils

We live in a very materialistic world and people try to buy themselves out of all problems. This approach will never leave anyone fulfilled. Money can‚Äôt buy you everything in fact the more money one has the more one wants to get. Many people have spent their whole lives trying to be successful and end up so sick that they can‚Äôt even enjoy the money they saved.
For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. 1 Tim 6:10

We see people working multiple jobs to make it big in life, constantly thinking of how to make more money. This has caused them to skip Mass and other important spiritual activities. This also has drawn people away from family life. We see many young couples not wanting kids because they want a successful career. Let us stop for a moment and think what if we gain the whole world but lose our soul.
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction. 1 Tim 6:9

For we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it. 1 Tim 6:7

Let us remember that we came in empty-handed into this world and we will take nothing back with us.
Alexander the Great who conquered most of the world said ‚ÄúWith my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I want people to know that I came empty-handed into this world and likewise will go empty-handed from this world.‚Äù
Let us learn from Alexander the Great that when we die we take nothing with us.
Let us learn from the rich people who commit suicide due to depression that money does not buy everything.
In fact, the more money we give away for a good cause, the happier we feel. The other extreme is also dangerous, where people don‚Äôt want to spend anything on themselves.
When we give we should be smart in giving, as some people are in the habit of taking money and having a good time. Like beggars who only beg to have their next drink or joint.
There are also lazy and greedy people in this world who would take money even though they are not truly in need.
In the early church, some widows were probably taking advantage of the church‚Äôs generosity. The apostles had to become prudent about who gets aid and who does not.
If any woman believer has widowed relatives, she must assist them; the church is not to be burdened so that it will be able to help those who are truly widows. 1 Tim 5:16

So the next time you think of giving someone money, pray about it and try to use sound judgment. Give to those who are in need and will really use it. For example, you may want to give food instead of money to a drunk.
The Lord will bless us with good finances if we don‚Äôt run after money. Seek first His kingdom and all things will be added to you.
The right use of money is essential.
7Tell the rich in the present age not to be proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing as wealth but rather on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.
18Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, ready to share,
19thus accumulating as treasure a good foundation for the future, so as to win the life that is true life. 1 Tim 6:17-19

Our goal is eternal life, money will come and money will go, but our soul will live forever.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 357 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Timothy 4:14
*Do not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate.*
By the laying on of their hands, the Apostles ordained Timothy and other men to serve as presbyters (priests), under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

Timothy was later appointed as the Bishop of Ephesus.

1 Timothy 6:10
*For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.*

Money is not evil.  What is evil is the kind of person who we become when we start giving more importance to our money.  It is the love of money that gives rise to evil.\
When money becomes our god (idol worship), then we start inviting evil spirits into our lives and into our homes.  Our love for money causes us to fight with others, break human relations, and sometimes go to extreme ends (fraud, lies, murder, theft, false accusations, etc.) to possess it.

When money comes into our hands we feel we are superior to others and we begin to disrespect the ones who are financially below our level.\
When we have a successful career we start idolizing our jobs because of the money it brings in.\
Sometimes we also idolize our possessions because we spent a lot of money on them.\
Even if we worship God on the side, our focus will always be on the people and activities which bring in money.  We give less or no time and importance to God, but more time and importance to the people and areas related to money.

When God blesses us financially, He expects us to raise our *standard of giving*, not our *standard of living*, but when we have money with us the temptation to *keep* will be much stronger than the desire to *give* and we may find all kinds of excuses why we *cannot* and *should not* and *must not* give.

We are not supposed to love our money.  God wants us to spread love, live a simple life and share our extras with the less fortunate ones around us.

Paul was writing to the Christians in Ephesus who may have been living in obedience to the Church laws and the commandments, but were also carried away with unhealthy practices in their desire for acquiring riches.
Even a faithful Christian who keeps all God‚Äôs commandments, obeys the Church laws and attends Church service / Mass regularly, can flow with the crowd and get tricked by the devil into believing that it is not wrong to do such things.  Therefore we must be very careful about the kind of people we associate with.

Idol worship is a direct violation of God‚Äôs commandment and is therefore a mortal sin, and as Paul warns us, we must not receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist in a state of mortal sin (1 Corinthians 11:27).  It is therefore important that we repent, receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and change our lives before receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).

Without the grace of God we cannot give freely the way God wants us to give. Therefore we must pray to God daily to give us that special grace.
