### Day #276 Take a stance for what is right

Ester 3:1-2 “Mordecai Refuses To Honor Haman. Sometime later, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, giving him a higher rank and seating him above all his royal nobles. All the royal officials who were at the king’s gate would kneel down and render homage to Haman, for that is what the king had ordered to be done toward him. But Mordecai refused to kneel and bow down to him.”
Mordecai’s refusal to kneel did not sit well with Haman. Haman came up with a plan to wipe out the Jews. Based on Haman’s advice King Ahasuerus send out a decree to kill all those who did not abide by the kingdom ordinances, specifically the Jews. King Ahasuerus wants to have peace and tranquility in the kingdom at any cost.
Although we may never need to kill someone who does not agree with us, we may exclude and alienate them. We sometimes like to live in a shell – where we allow on those who agree with us or keep things that make us happy. We may want to throw out church teachings, commandments and laws that we don’t like and live according to what gives “us” peace or makes us happy. We may want to even distance ourselves from people who reveal our truth or who correct us and keep us on track.

A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. Prov 21:6

We sometimes try to get peace from earthly securities like our bank balance, our position in society or influential friends or family. We try to gain a fortune in any way possible by lying or cheating others – let us remember this will not bring us peace.
We are willing at times to make a comprise of our faith and beliefs just so that we can fit into society or gain money. Let us learn from Mordecai and take a stance for the truth even if it will cost us something. We will have true peace and deliverance when we stand for the truth and do what is right in the eyes of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 276 By Cynthia Dsilva

Nehemiah 8:2–10
After the Babylonians were defeated by the Persians, King Cyrus of Persia decreed that the Jews who were exiled (from 587 to 537 BC) could return home to Jerusalem.  They rebuilt their ruined temple (Ezra 6:15–17) and under Nehemiah finished rebuilding the city walls (Nehemiah 6:15) around 450 BC.

During this time, God raised Ezra and commissioned him to go to Jerusalem and preach to the people. Ezra was a Scribe and a Priest (v.1, 2 & 9) who had studied the Law at one of the schools of the Jewish Scribes in Babylon.  This is first time we hear of a wooden platform (pulpit) in the Temple (v.4).

The Book of Nehemiah gives us a glimpse of the details of the liturgical service of the old Covenant.

Ezra, the Priest, was conducting a liturgical service.  He read the Law (the Word of God), it was explained to the congregation, then they celebrated with a sacrificial meal.

This was a prototype or shadow of the liturgical service (the Mass) of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, during the liturgical service the Priest reads the Gospel (the Word of God), explains it to the congregation, teaches them how to apply it to their lives and then they celebrate with the sacrificial meal (Communion).

*Ezra read the Law from early morning to midday (six hours)* (v.3).

The people were so hungry for the Word of God that they didn’t mind sitting in the Temple for six hours to hear it (v.3).

*When Ezra opened the scroll, all the people stood up* (v.5).

When the Priest reads the Gospel during Mass, the congregation stands to hear the Word of God in reverence because the Priest is reading the message from our God and heavenly King (Jesus).

*At the end of the Reading, the people answered “Amen, amen”* (v.6).

At the end of the Readings when we give a positive response to the Word of God (v.6) (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ, etc.) we are swearing to God that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7).  Saying “Amen” and doing otherwise means we are breaking our oath.

*After the Law (the Word of God) was read, the Priests interpreted the Law to help the people understand, while the people remained sitting* (v.7-8).

After the 3 readings and Gospel are read in Church, the congregation sits to hear the Priest interpret the Gospel and explain how the New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is revealed in the New, and how we can apply it to our lives.

*When the people heard the Law and the consequences for disobedience, they wept because they realized how far they had gone from God due to no one being available to read the Law to them.  They understood that they themselves were responsible for their exile due to their sins (v.9).*

When a person realizes that he/she has been walking in the wrong direction, and repents, it is normal for him/her to cry because that is the time the Holy Spirit is activated and therefore the evil spirits must leave the soul, thus causing some reaction.

*But Ezra and the Levites consoled the people that this was not a time for weeping and grieving. They had renewed their Covenant with God during the liturgical service, so it was a time for rejoicing* (v.9).

In the New Covenant Church also, after our venial sins are forgiven and after we have heard the Word of God and offered the divine sacrifice (the Lamb of God), we are covered with white robes because we have renewed our Covenant with God.  It is therefore not a time for us to weep or grieve over our past sins.  It is a time for rejoicing with the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal.

*Ezra and the priests advised the people to share the sacrificial meal* (v.10).

In the New Covenant Church also, the priests must ensure to share the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal with those who are not able to attend the liturgical service (the elderly, the sick, the disabled, etc.).  However, it is the duty of the lay congregation to inform the priests of any such persons so that Communion can be given to them at their homes.

Although the Judeans rebuilt the Temple, their knowledge of the faith was very poor because there was no one to read the Word of God to them so the people had not heard the Word of God for many years. Moreover, they did not have access to the written Word of God, because copying and printing was not very common in those days.

But 2500 years later, in today’s world we are blessed to have so many ways to read the Word of God. We have hard copies, online text Bibles, online audio Bibles, etc. So let us not waste this opportunity which God has given us to have access to His Word. Let us make use of it as much as we can before it is too late.
