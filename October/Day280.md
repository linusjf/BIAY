### Day #280 Days of Remembrance

Most human beings have a problem of forgetting, we forget birthdays and anniversaries. Apart from forgetting dates we even forget the blessings, mercies, and love of the Lord. We should consider ourselves blessed as the mother church reminds us of the important things. We have feast days, memorials, solemnities, and Holy days of obligation. We have ordinary times and then we have Seasons like Advent, Lent, Easter, and Christmas. If we ever wondered why they were needed every year, one answer could be to help us remember and another answer could be so that we can go deeper in our understanding and love of them.
The Catholic church did not invent this process of remembering things, we just do as the Jewish people did. The feasts and memorials were set up as per God‚Äôs direction.
We read about the feast of `Purim` which reminds them of God‚Äôs intervention, God saved His people, rescued them from death and vindicated them.
So the next them we feel that repeating feasts and seasons is redundant let us dig deeper and immerse ourselves more and more into the life of the church, the sacraments, and the liturgy.
Didn‚Äôt Jesus as us to remember Him in the breaking of the bread?
And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‚ÄúThis is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù Luke 22:19

Even the followers of Jesus devoted themselves to remembering the Lord in the Eucharist and in the teachings of the Lord.
They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. Acts 2:42
Hope this inspires all of us to frequent the sacraments and study his word more.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
