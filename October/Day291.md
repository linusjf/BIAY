### Day 291 A good wife is a generous gift

Joke alert: God told all bachelors ‚ÄúThere are many good potential wives in every corner of the earth and then God made the world round‚Äù hahahahaha. Hope this poor joke made you smile.
Imagine someone browsing matrimonial and dating sites that have tons of profiles, one can get frustrated trying to find a good match, it may seem as though there are no more good people left in the world. Although I cannot find you a partner, I would recommend praying that God will bring the right person into your life. The partner you pick will influence your future, your spiritual life, the care of your parents and most importantly the upbringing of children. Try to find a holy, modest, loving and caring person and then you will have a good life.
Happy the husband of a good wife;
the number of his days will be doubled.
A loyal wife brings joy to her husband,
and he will finish his years in peace.
A good wife is a generous gift
bestowed upon him who fears the Lord.
Whether rich or poor, his heart is content,
a smile ever on his face. Sirach 26:1-4
A good spouse is one who will be with you in good and bad times, in rich and poor, in health and sickness, till death do us part. Knowing how to live in moderation and according to one's means is one of the most important qualities that both spouses should have, this will help build a secure and loving environment for the children.
A drunken wife arouses great anger,
for she does not hide her shame.
By her haughty stare and her eyelids
an unchaste wife can be recognized.
Keep a strict watch over an unruly wife,
lest, finding an opportunity, she use it;
Watch out for her impudent eye,
and do not be surprised if she betrays you: Sirach 26:8-11
If a husband or wife is a drunkard then this can cause a lot of strife and unhealthy situation. Sometimes people are overly concerned for looks, fashion and lifestyle this can cause one to make a mistake while choosing a spouse.
A gracious wife delights her husband;
her thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones.
A silent wife is a gift from the Lord;
nothing is worth more than her self-discipline.
A modest wife is a supreme blessing;
no scales can weigh the worth of her chastity.
We should always look for someone who is self-disciplined and modest. Someone who have virtue and is grounded in their faith. A good tree will bear good fruit and a bad tree bad fruit, we should be very careful and discerning to marry a person who is good. It is very hard for anyone to change their ways, so expecting someone to change after marriage is a far shot.
Let us remember that God has a plan for each of us as we will be given a spouse who will bring the best out of us. Let us pray for our spouses every day and support them in every way possible.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
