### Day #281 Does God really love us?

There are some fundamental questions that every human being across every generation asks of God. Even though the Bible has a lot of verses on God’s love we tend to doubt His love.
“I have loved you,” says the Lord.
“But you ask, ‘How have you loved us?’ Malachi 1:2

The world would say, “If God loves us He would let us do what we want” Or “If God loves us he would not let any suffering come into the world”. We need to realize that God has a plan for us a plan for us to be united with Him, for even if we have everything we want in this world we will not be satisfied we will only be satisfied if we rest in God.
Instead of serving that Lord with all their hearts, the priest at the time of prophet Malachi were corrupt and defiled the worship of God.

“It is you priests who show contempt for my name.
“But you ask, ‘How have we shown contempt for your name?’
7 “By offering defiled food on my altar.
“But you ask, ‘How have we defiled you?’ Malachi 1:6

It’s not just the priests but also marriages were not kept sacred. First of all the people were marrying foreign wives and the children were learning idol worship. Also, divorce was rampant and immortality was on the rise.
For I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and covering one’s garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless. Malachi 2:16

It seemed that humanity would never be able to redeem itself as we had dug ourselves into this rabbit hole of selfishness.

The last prophet before John the Baptist, Malachi reveals God’s plan to redeem humanity.

5 Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. 6 He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse. Mal 4:5

Here is the prophecy of John the Baptist and his role in preparing the way of the Lord. John proclaims that the Kingdom of God is at hand, that the redeemer of the world is coming with healing in his wings, that the sun of righteousness will rise and we will have a new covenant with holy priest offering a holy Sacrifice of the Mass and with Marriages where there is love and holiness.
The question we need to ask ourselves is “Has the world really changed, does my life reflect God’s love, are our priests serving the Lord with a pure heart, are marriages holy, is there divorce today because we read from Malachi that God hates divorce.”
Let us prepare for the second coming of Christ, the Church asks us to prepare for it every time we are called to repentance. We hear John the Baptist cry to prepare the way of the Lord every Advent and Lent. Let those who have ears hear!!!

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Malachi 2:1-3
*And now, O priests, this command is for you.  If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.  I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.*

God was warning the priests because His priesthood was defiled.
God was also warning the married couples because the priests of the old Covenant were married men and, along with their priesthood, their marriages were also defiled.
Like marriage, the Covenant with the priesthood was to be a lifetime bond, but the priests had become lukewarm in their duties. They compromised with the Word of God to please the people.
This was a warning for all priests unto the end of time.

If the priests continue in their ungodly practices then God will discard them from His Kingdom like the dung from the sin offerings (Exodus 29:14).

Malachi 3:1
*Behold, I send my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father before the coming of the new Israel (Jesus) who would lead His people in the new exodus (Mark/1/2) towards the promised land (Heaven).

Jesus suddenly came to His Temple, without any public announcement, on the days He was to be circumcised and presented, and Simeon & Anna recognized Him (Luke 2:21-38).

Malachi 3:13-15
*You have spoken harsh words against me, says the LORD.*
*You ask, “What have we spoken against you?”*
*You have said, “It is useless to serve God; what do we gain by observing God’s requirements, and by going about as mourners before the LORD of hosts?  We call the arrogant blessed; for evildoers not only prosper but even test God and escape.”*

Like those people, we too can get caught up in the circle of questioning God when things are constantly going wrong in our lives, inspite of obeying God always, while the ungodly ones seem to be prospering.
