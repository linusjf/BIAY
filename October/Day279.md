### Day #279 Live life in moderation.

We live in a consumeristic and materialistic world today, where everyone is in a race to get the best. Most of the conversations revolve around the best cars, gadgets, makeup, and house. People boast about the holidays they took or how much they spent on destination weddings. This generation wants the most extravagant experiences, the most lavish travel, comfort and luxuries are all we seek after. We want to satisfy all the senses and are focused on this world more than eternal life.

Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.
18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.
19 Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
20 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. Prov 21:17-20

Today‚Äôs proverb helps us keep our appetites in check, we should not be lovers of pleasure if not we will end up becoming poor ‚Äì both financially and spiritually. It‚Äôs better to live in a desert than with a spouse who wants materialistic stuff and keeps on nagging and complaining until it's provided, BTW it‚Äôs not just the wife who nags. ü§£

The wise store up riches and save for the future, the foolish burn holes in their credit cards and get into debt. We should learn from the St Benedict and live a balanced life.
St. Benedict also displayed a spirit of moderation. His monks are allowed clothes suited to the climate, sufficient food and sufficient sleep (7 1/2‚Äì8 hours). The working day is divided into three roughly equal portions: five to six hours of liturgical and other prayer; five hours of manual work, whether domestic work, craft work, garden work, or fieldwork; and four hours reading of the Scriptures and spiritual writings. This balance of prayer, work, and study is another of Benedict‚Äôs
Let us be like wise people, work-eat-live-sleep-save-spend in moderation. Love the Lord and our families in excess, build up treasures for ourselves that moths and rust can‚Äôt destroy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
