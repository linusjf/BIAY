### Day 292 Diffuse a quarrel with a good word

Let us try to take a moment to recall the last few times we got angry, and remember what we said when we were angry. More often than not, we would have said something that hurt the other person. When we are angry we say things that we ordinarily would not say.

When there is a quarrel then we can take one of these approaches, flight back, be silent, apologize or diffuse the flight with good words. In the heat of the moment, we are usually unable to say the right words with the right tone. We usually end up saying nasty things to each other and hurting each other. After things cool down, we realize how poorly we spoke and cannot take the words back. These words have broken many relationships and their damage can be felt a lifetime.

A blow from a whip raises a welt,
but a blow from the tongue will break bones.
Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,
but not as many as by the tongue. Sirach 28:17-18

We should train ourselves to be calm and speak well during an argument. Both good and bad words come out of the same mouth.

If you blow into a flame it burns more but if you split into it, it dies down.
If you blow on a spark, it turns into flame,
if you spit on it, it dies out;
yet both you do with your mouth! Sirach 28:12

We should learn how to choose our words wisely, and balance out every word we say. We should put a door and a bolt on our mouth, if we cannot say anything good say nothing.

As you fence in your property with thorns,
so make a door and a bolt for your mouth.
As you lock up your silver and gold,
so make balances and scales for your words.
Take care not to slip by your tongue
and fall victim to one lying in ambush. Sirach 28: 24-26

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
