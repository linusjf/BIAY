### Day #277 Pray hard in times of trouble.

The Jews face being wiped out and there seems to be no way out as King Ahasuerus already passed the ordinance to kill anyone who does not comply. Mordecai is such a good example of not backing off when the enemy threatens. He and the other Jews resort to mourning and prayer.

When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the king‚Äôs gate, for no one might enter the king‚Äôs gate clothed with sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king‚Äôs command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. Esther 4:4

Mordecai also requested that queen Esther make supplications on behalf of the Jews. However it was not permitted for queen Ester to approach the king unless she was called. In that province, if anyone went to the King without being called they could face death.
This information did not deter Mordecai, he went on to remind Queen Esther.

‚ÄúDo not think that in the king‚Äôs palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father‚Äôs family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.‚Äù Esther 4:13,14

This advice gave Esther courage and she agreed to this difficult calling.
‚ÄúGo, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.‚Äù Esther 4:16

When we face tough situations we may want to run away or ignore it, but we should pray hard and face them instead. We should not just think about ourselves but about everyone else as well. We may be filled with fear but we should surrender our fear to the Lord and realize our current position and calling in life, maybe we were born for such a time as this. Maybe God has put us in a position so that we can help God‚Äôs people. Let us not fear to take a stand for the truth, even if it may cost our lives. We cannot do it on our own, we have to pray and surrender like Esther who prayed for 3 days before she approached the King.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
