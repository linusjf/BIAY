### Day #277 Pray hard in times of trouble.

The Jews face being wiped out and there seems to be no way out as King Ahasuerus already passed the ordinance to kill anyone who does not comply. Mordecai is such a good example of not backing off when the enemy threatens. He and the other Jews resort to mourning and prayer.

When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the king’s gate, for no one might enter the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king’s command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. Esther 4:4

Mordecai also requested that queen Esther make supplications on behalf of the Jews. However it was not permitted for queen Ester to approach the king unless she was called. In that province, if anyone went to the King without being called they could face death.
This information did not deter Mordecai, he went on to remind Queen Esther.

“Do not think that in the king’s palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father’s family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.” Esther 4:13,14

This advice gave Esther courage and she agreed to this difficult calling.
“Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.” Esther 4:16

When we face tough situations we may want to run away or ignore it, but we should pray hard and face them instead. We should not just think about ourselves but about everyone else as well. We may be filled with fear but we should surrender our fear to the Lord and realize our current position and calling in life, maybe we were born for such a time as this. Maybe God has put us in a position so that we can help God’s people. Let us not fear to take a stand for the truth, even if it may cost our lives. We cannot do it on our own, we have to pray and surrender like Esther who prayed for 3 days before she approached the King.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 277 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 6:1-11

Mordecai was not given honor for saving the King's life (Esther 2:21-23) but Mordecai being a humble man, did not complain or do anything to remind the king about it.  He continued doing his gatekeeper’s duty and focused on worshipping the living God and would not let anyone change that for him. God saw his heart for almost 7 years and then took the necessary action to shower Mordecai with blessings.

God allowed Haman to make the ungodly command that all his subordinates must kneel and bow down to him, because God wanted to test Mordecai's faithfulness.

God allows the ungodly ones to make evil plots against His people to spiritually heal the good ones or to glorify the holy ones.

For the Lord will raise the humble, but the haughty eyes He will bring down. (Psalm 18:27).

When we obey the devil our physical destruction may or may not happen but our eternal destruction is definite.

We get whatever we give others and whatever we wish for others.

Let us therefore spread love and compassion, wherever we go, and wish the prosperity of others.

Let us avoid spreading anger, hatred and envy, and wishing the destruction of others.

Esther 6:13
*Haman’s wife and friends said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him.”*

He, who had planned the destruction of God’s faithful people and their families, himself met with destruction along with his family.

God has sent each one of His chosen people to the earth with a mission, but Satan always stirs up his disciples to plant obstacles or to destroy the mission.  Those who plot to destroy God's people before His mission is accomplished, will meet their own destruction.  It is for God to decide when we should leave the earth. Satan cannot destroy us (body and soul) if we allow God to control our lives and remain obedient to His commandments.  That is not a guarantee for a long life.  It just means that we will have sufficient time to accomplish the mission which God assigned to us for the growth of His Kingdom on earth (the Church), and God will be with us all the way through.

When God is for us, no one can be against us (Romans 8:31), and no weapon fashioned against us shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17), but God will be for us only if we obey Him.
