### Day 300 The sovereign power of God

Some people cannot handle defeat they want to win at any cost, they are ruthless and cruel or outright barbarous one such example is Simon in Maccabees. The high priest Onias was a very devout and pious, one who hated evil, because of his devotion everything was going very well in the temple.
Simon who was the appointment superintendent of the temple had a quarrel with Onias and lost. In order to see his downfall Simon went to the pagan king and reported that the temple was full of untold riches. The King sends his officers to forcefully bring the money to the royal treasury.
This money was actually for the widows and orphans who had no other means of survival. Now the priests and all the people had no other option but to ask God for his protection.
Priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priestly robes and called toward heaven for the one who had given the law about deposits to keep the deposits safe for those who had made them.

Whoever saw the appearance of the high priest was pierced to the heart, for the changed complexion of his face revealed his mental anguish.
The terror and bodily trembling that had come over the man clearly showed those who saw him the pain that lodged in his heart.
People rushed out of their houses and crowded together making common supplication, because the place was in danger of being profaned. Maccabees 3: 15-18

God Protects the Temple.

24But just as Heliodorus was arriving at the treasury with his bodyguards, the Lord of spirits and all authority produced an apparition so great that those who had been bold enough to accompany Heliodorus were panic-stricken at God‚Äôs power and fainted away in terror.
25There appeared to them a richly caparisoned horse, mounted by a fearsome rider. Charging furiously, the horse attacked Heliodorus with its front hooves. The rider was seen wearing golden armor.
26Then two other young men, remarkably strong, strikingly handsome, and splendidly attired, appeared before him. Standing on each side of him, they flogged him unceasingly, inflicting innumerable blows.
27Suddenly he fell to the ground, enveloped in great darkness. His men picked him up and laid him on a stretcher.
28They carried away helpless the man who a moment before had entered that treasury under arms with a great retinue and his whole bodyguard. They clearly recognized the sovereign power of God.
Maccabees 3: 24-28

When there seems to be no other option God comes through for us, He is always there and just by a word God can move mountains for us. There are always countless angles around us, just waiting for deployment orders. Even though we don‚Äôt see them we can be sure that they will come to our aid in time of need.

For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent. Ps 91: 11-13

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. Ps 34: 7

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
