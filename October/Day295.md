### Day 295 God does not accept bribes

We may bribe our way through society or find loopholes to evade the law. But there is no way to bribe our way to heaven or to get what we want on earth. Many people try to bribe God with their gifts of money, time, or sacrifice. Some folks make deals with God saying if you grant me this favor ‚Äì maybe a job or house or something then I will give certain offerings or feed the poor or something along those lines. We should not try to bribe God with our offers expecting a certain result in return.

Give to the Most High as he has given to you,
generously, according to your means.
For he is a God who always repays
and will give back to you sevenfold.
But offer no bribes; these he does not accept! Sirach 35:12-14

When we give to God we should not have an agenda behind it, we should just trust God with every area of our lives. God‚Äôs plans for us are better than our own and He is a faithful God. We should freely and joyfully give to God. For God loves a cheerful giver.

Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:7

We know that God is a faithful God who will never go back on His promise. He will give us back 7 folds of our gift. We should give according to our means because we received everything from God in the first place. The only time God asks us to test Him is for the return of the tithe.

Bring the whole tithe
into the storehouse,
That there may be food in my house.
Put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts,
And see if I do not open the floodgates of heaven for you,
and pour down upon you blessing without measure! Malachi 3:10

God is calling us to give our whole tithe and to trust Him for a blessing, a blessing that will be far more than we can imagine. The floodgates of heaven will be opened a large blessing will pour down.

Do not appear before the Lord empty-handed,
for all that you offer is in fulfillment of the precepts.
The offering of the just enriches the altar:
a sweet odor before the Most High.
The sacrifice of the just is accepted, never to be forgotten. Sir 35:6-9

So the next time we approach the temple of the Lord, let us not go empty-handed but let us give freely according to our means, without bribing the Lord or expecting a certain result. Let us expect the Lord to bless us beyond our imagination.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
