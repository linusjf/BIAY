### Day 298 Do not fear death

It seems that everyone is trying their best to live longer, look younger, and secure thier life on earth. Now there is nothing wrong with this as long as we are also preparing for our next life by doing good deeds and living a holy life.
If we are only concerned about this life then we will fear death

O death! How bitter is the thought of you
for the one at peace in his home,
For the one who is serene and always successful,
who can still enjoy life‚Äôs pleasures. Sirach 41:1

Death may be something some people may be hoping for, especially those who are suffering. Sometimes people we are caring for the terminally sick may even pray that God may take them.

O death! How welcome is your sentence
to the weak, failing in strength,
Stumbling and tripping on everything,
with sight gone and hope lost.a Sirach 41:2

Whatever be the case, we should always be ready for death if we are preparing for it we will not fear.

Do not fear death‚Äôs decree for you;
remember, it embraces those before you and those to come. Sirach 41:3

As in the wedding feast parable, we are expected to wear wedding garments and be ready for the day the Lord calls us.
The clothes are our 1. good deeds 2. Good nature 3. Christ

1. GOOD DEEDS ARE THE CLOTHES THAT THE BRIDE IN REVELATIONS IS WHAT MAKE THE FINE LINEN.
   Rev 19: 7-8
   Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory,
   for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
   and his Bride has made herself ready;
   8 it was granted her to be clothed
   with fine linen, bright and pure‚Äù‚Äî
   for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
2. GOOD NATURE

Col 3:12-15
As God‚Äôs chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

3. WE ARE TO PUT ON CHRIST

Ep 4: 22-24 You were taught to put away your former way of life, your old self, corrupt and deluded by its lusts, 23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 24 and to clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh Rom 13:14

What we lack in our own ability, God makes up for us in the life , death and resurrection of Christ. Let us face death with confidence that Jesus died for us and If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.(Rom 8:11)

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
