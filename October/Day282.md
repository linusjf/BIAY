### Day 282 Patient Endurance

Life can be tough and we will have many opportunities to lose our cool. We can get angry and frustrated, resulting in hasty decisions or even harmful actions. We read some wise words from Sirach which can help us in times of anger.

Unjust anger cannot be justified, for anger tips the scale to one‚Äôs ruin. Those who are patient stay calm until the right moment, and then cheerfulness comes back to them. They hold back their words until the right moment; then the lips of many tell of their good sense. Sirach 1:22-24

We need to be patient and clam and wait for the right moment which is easier said than done. The Fear of the Lord can help us in times of anguish.

For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline, fidelity and humility are his delight. Sirach 1:27
The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish Sirach 1:18

The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, and gladness and a crown of rejoicing. 12 The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives gladness and joy and long life. Sirach 1: 11-13

The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a haughty person will find it hard to experience wisdom. The Fear of the Lord isn‚Äôt us getting afraid of God but it‚Äôs being afraid of offending the Lord with our sin. The next time we get angry imagine that Jesus is there in place of the person we are angry with and see if we are able to say the same things to them.
The Fear of the Lord drives out all fear of the world. Like some of the Jews that we read about in 1 Maccabees who did not fear being persecuted. Alexander the great died and gave his 4 generals authority, they wanted to setup pagan religions and forced the Jews to accept it. Some Jews gladly accepted it while other decided to endure the suffering they were put to, suffering unto death.
We are called to be people of patient endurance. We are to love the Fear of the Lord so we will be able overcome the fear of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
