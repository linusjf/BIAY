### Day 293 We all need discipline

There is no rocket science to this anyone who wants to succeed in life needs to have discipline. Without discipline and dedication, it's almost impossible to be good at anything. We need to start them young and in today‚Äôs reading from Sirach we read a father's instructions to his son, probably showing him the ropes so that his grandchildren will be raised right.

Whoever loves a son will chastise him often,
that he may be his joy when he grows up.
Whoever disciplines a son will benefit from him,
and boast of him among acquaintances.
Whoever educates a son will make his enemy jealous,
and rejoice in him among his friends.
At the father‚Äôs death, he will seem not dead,
for he leaves after him one like himself,
Whom he looked upon through life with joy,
and in death, without regret.

My mom always said ‚ÄúIf you bring a soul into this world you are responsible for it‚Äù. Parents need to discipline their kids and educate them and make them a better version of what the parents are. If we raise our children right we can be joyful on our death bed knowing that this world is a little better because of our good parenting.

Do not withhold discipline from youths;
if you beat them with the rod, they will not die.
Beat them with the rod.
and you will save them from Sheol. Proverbs 23:13-14

This reading may seem harsh, as we don‚Äôt usually see youth being disciplined by the rod in our modern-day and age. The Bible verse does not promote beating children but focuses on disciplining them. Whatever you feel appropriate for your kids like time-outs, grounding, positive parenting, whatever method you take, you need to ensure they have boundaries and limitations, are responsible and accountable.
But discipline should not stop with our children, we should discipline ourselves as well. We should take good care of our bodies as well as our souls.

Better the poor in vigorous health
than the rich with bodily ills.
would rather have bodily health than any gold,
and contentment of spirit than pearls.
No riches are greater than a healthy body;
and no happiness than a joyful heart.
Better is death than a wretched life,
everlasting sleep than constant illness.
Good things set before one who cannot eat
are like food offerings placed before a tomb. Sirach 30:14-18

What good it is if we neglect our health and earn a lot of money, health is better than wealth. Hence the saving ‚ÄúHealth is wealth‚Äù. If we earn all the money in the world and cannot eat anything delicious, what good is all your earnings.
Do not give in to sadness,
or torment yourself deliberately.
Gladness of heart is the very life of a person,
and cheerfulness prolongs his days.
Distract yourself and renew your courage,
drive resentment far away from you;
For grief has killed many,
and nothing is to be gained from resentment.
Envy and anger shorten one‚Äôs days,
and anxiety brings on premature old age. Sirach 30:21-24

We also should take care of our mental health, grief has killed many people either through suicide or causing bad physical health. Envy and anger shorten one‚Äôs life. Let us not give into sadness or resentment ‚Äì instead let us be cheerful and grateful. Anger and Envy can cause us to rot and become grumpy and nasty.
Wakefulness over wealth wastes away the flesh,
and anxiety over it drives away sleep.
Wakeful anxiety banishes slumber;
more than a serious illness it disturbs repose. Sirach 31:2

Anxiety and wakefulness can lead to major health conditions and sicknesses. So let us disciple ourselves to trust in the Lord and to rely fully on Him. To keep our head up and to always be hopeful no matter how bad the situation may look.
Let us try to live a healthy lifestyle with God in the center of it.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
