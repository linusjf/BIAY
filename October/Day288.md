### Day 288 Let anything you hear die with you; never fear, it will not make you burst

We all know someone or many people who struggle with the sin of gossip. There are folks who cannot stomach a secret or can‚Äôt even rest until they tell someone the gossip. Just reading Sirach will make you laugh when you think of gossipmongers.
Tell nothing to friend or foe;
and unless it be a sin for you, do not reveal a thing.
For someone may have heard you and watched you,
and in time come to hate you.
Let anything you hear die with you;
never fear, it will not make you burst!
Having heard something, the fool goes into labor,
like a woman giving birth to a child.
Like an arrow stuck in a fool‚Äôs thigh,
so is gossip in the belly of a fool. Sirach 19: 8-12
When you hear something confidential, or bad about a person try your best to not tell anyone unless it‚Äôs a sin to keep it to yourself. Just try not to say anything it may cause more ruin to that person. Come on, you won‚Äôt burst open don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre in labor and just have to deliver this gossip. Only a fool cannot hold gossip in any smart person will take it in from one ear and send it out the other. The better option would be to even step away from conversations that are not healthy.
So what should we do if we find out that someone has said something bad about us. We should first of all not reach until we investigate if it was actually true. We should go straight to the person who supposedly said something about you and talk to them directly to sort out the matter.
Admonish your friend‚Äîhe may not have done it;
and if he did, that he may not do it again.e
Admonish your neighbor‚Äîhe may not have said it;
and if he did, that he may not say it again.
Admonish your friend‚Äîoften it may be slander;
do not believe every story. Sirach 19:13-15
If we approach them directly there can be 3 positive outcomes

1. They may never say it or do it again
2. They may have never said it in the first place
3. They may apologize and we have made the friendship stronger.
   Let us try our best to avoid all gossip and to resort to speaking openly and directly to our friends and family. This will cause a much better society where everyone is built up and encouraged not slandered and brought down.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
