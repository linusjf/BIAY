### Day 301 Sports More Important than Church

Yesterday we read how corrupt Simon was trying to get rid Onias the devout high priest. As we read more there are other people trying to become high priests not because they want to lead God’s people spiritually but for monetary/social gain.
Onias’ brother Jason is also trying to obtain the high priesthood by corrupt means, by bribing the king. Apart from bribing the king he also promised to establish a gymnasium and youth center which would initiate the youth into the Greek way of life.
Besides this he would undertake to pay a hundred and fifty more, if he was given authority to establish a gymnasium and a youth center for it and to enroll Jerusalemites as citizens of Antioch.

When Jason received the king’s approval and came into office, he immediately initiated his compatriots into the Greek way of life. 2 Maccabees 4:9-10

The King approved of Jason’s plans and this there was a decline in Jewish practices and customs by the youth and a attachment to the new Greek way of life.
With perverse delight he established a gymnasium at the very foot of the citadel, where he induced the noblest young men to wear the Greek hat.
The craze for Hellenism and the adoption of foreign customs reached such a pitch, through the outrageous wickedness of Jason, the renegade and would-be high priest,
that the priests no longer cared about the service of the altar. Disdaining the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened, at the signal for the games, to take part in the unlawful exercises at the arena.
What their ancestors had regarded as honors they despised; what the Greeks esteemed as glory they prized highly. 2 Maccabees 4:13-15

Jason knew and so did the king, if they could get the youth to follow the Greek lifestyle then the next generation would not be a treat to the kingdom, they would abandon their faith, customs and practices.
This is exactly what is happening in our generation, little Tom or Sally has Baseball/Soccer/Football/Dance class on the weekend and the whole family can’t go to church. The game is On and we need to get the house ready for our friends and family so we are not going to church. When we elevate sports and arts above God and church we are heading for a disaster. Just like the Jews forgot their faith and got carried away by the Greek Gymnasium and games so is our generation going away from Church and God.
This has to stop!!!! If not we lose the youth the future of the church.
We need to ensure that going to church on Sunday/Saturday eve is the most important thing to our family. If it comes to it, we should be willing to skip games/practice for Church. We need more Christians to talk to coaches and clubs to schedule practice at a convenient time such that every child gets to go to Church. If we don’t act non, we have lost a generation.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
