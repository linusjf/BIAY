### Day #278 When we are weak He is strong

After praying for 3 days, Queen Esther surrendered everything to God and went to meet the king adorned in splendor.

“ She was radiant with perfect beauty, and she looked happy, as if beloved, but her heart was frozen with fear. 6 When she had gone through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones. He was most terrifying.
7 Lifting his face, flushed with splendor, he looked at her in fierce anger. The queen faltered, and turned pale and faint, and collapsed on the head of the maid who went in front of her. 8 Then God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself. He comforted her with soothing words, and said to her, 9 “What is it, Esther? I am your husband. Take courage; 10 You shall not die, for our law applies only to our subjects. Come near.” Esther 15:5-10

God came to her assistance and saved Queen Esther, what her beauty could not do God did. Had the Lord not intervened and changed the heart of the King, Queen Esther would have lost her life as that was the law of the Kingdom that anyone who appears before the king without his permission would die.

We can be assured that the God who saved Queen Esther and the Israelites will also save us. We need to trust in God and surrender every situation to his providence. God will come through when our earthly ability and strength fails. He will never let us suffer beyond our ability. When we are weak He is strong, His grace is sufficient for us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 278 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 8:8
*The king said to Queen Esther, “You may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king’s ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king’s ring cannot be revoked.”*

Haman managed to convince the king that all the Jews must be destroyed because they were not obeying the king’s laws and therefore there was no reason for the king to tolerate them (Esther 3:8-9); and the king agreed.  Haman did this to take revenge on Mordecai for not bowing down to him (Esther 3:5-6).

When we are in the midst of a negative and difficult situation we are usually faced with a difficult choice; one would be God’s way and the other would be the devil’s way.  God does not intervene in the situation until we make our choice according to His Will.

If we choose to follow God’s way, irrespective of what the consequences may be, only then God will intervene and steer the situation in our favor according to His plan.
If we choose to go the devil’s way, then God will NOT intervene and we will meet our destruction, if not in this world then definitely in the next world.

When the people of Israel were going to face a death penalty, Esther was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let her people die, OR
2. to risk her life to save her nation.

Esther made an unselfish choice.  She knew that if she went to the king’s inner court without being called by the king, she could be put to death (Esther 4:11).  Esther, however, did not care about her own comfort and safety.  She decided she would risk her life to save her nation.  She chose Option 2 (Esther 4:16).  God was pleased and intervened to save her nation from annihilation.  As a result many non-Jews converted to Judaism (Esther 8:17).

If Esther had chosen Option 1, then she may have been safe temporarily, but eventually she too would have perished along with her people according to the decree.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

When the world was going to face the eternal death penalty (Hell), due to original sin, Mary was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let the world perish, OR
2. to risk her life to save the world.

Like Esther, Mary made an unselfish choice.  She chose option 2.
Mary risked her life to bear a child when she was still unmarried, knowing that she could be stoned to death according to the Mosaic Law.  But Mary did not care about her own comfort and safety.  She was more concerned about the redemption of the world and she knew how important it was for God.  She therefore chose to do God’s Will.  God was pleased and intervened to send an angel to speak to Joseph to accept Mary as his wife so that she could be saved from being stoned.  Thereafter God sent His Son to save the world from eternal damnation.  As a result many Jews and non-Jews converted to Christianity.

If we are faced with a difficult decision to choose between benefits or safety of ourselves and that of others, let us make unselfish choices, like Esther and Mary, so that we may be blessed along with the others.

*Thank you, mamma Mary, for your unconditional “yes.*”
