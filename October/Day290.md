### Day 290 Good things in life

Our society has gotten us thinking that the good things in life are a good house, a good job, a car, a big bank balance, status in life etc. All of these are good and everyone should in moderation aim to get them. However, there are more important things than this it‚Äôs called a relationship.
With three things I am delighted,
for they are pleasing to the Lord and to human beings:
Harmony among relatives, friendship among neighbors,
and a wife and a husband living happily together. Sirach 25:1

When we talk about relationships the most important ones are 1. Family 2. Community and 3. spouse. not in any order.

Many families are divided, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and in-laws are not talking to each other and can‚Äôt even be in the same room. There seems to be a lot of unrest in communities these days, with people forming groups, exclusion, enmity, fights, and the like.
Even the most precious relationship of a husband and wife seems to be broken sometimes. One tries to dominate the other or is driven by personal gain.
I would rather live with a dragon or a lion
than live with a wicked woman.
A woman‚Äôs wicked disposition changes her appearance,
and makes her face as dark as a bear.
When her husband sits among his neighbors,
a bitter sigh escapes him unawares.
There is hardly an evil like that in a woman;
may she fall to the lot of the sinner!
Like a sandy hill to aged feet
is a garrulous wife to a quiet husband.
Do not be enticed by a woman‚Äôs beauty,
or be greedy for her wealth. Sirach 25: 16-21

The scripture says wife but it‚Äôs also true for husbands, if your life partner is wicked ‚Äì it would be better to live with a wild animal. If there is no love in a marriage, when there is nothing left to talk about then life can become a living hell. When one spouse is overly quarrelsome and nagging even everyday life can become a drag. When a spouse does not make any effort to change or do better ‚Äì one can feel trapped in this beautiful sacrament. That is why we should be very careful while picking a spouse don‚Äôt look for beauty or wealth. Look for someone who is good and true, simple and God-loving.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
