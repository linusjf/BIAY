### Day 303 Be a good example to the world.

We read about the Martyrdom of Eleazar who was a devout Jew an old man who has been practicing his faith all his life.

18 Eleazar, one of the foremost scribes, a man advanced in age and of noble appearance, was being forced to open his mouth to eat pork.
19But preferring a glorious death to a life of defilement, he went forward of his own accord to the instrument of torture,
20spitting out the meat as they should do who have the courage to reject food unlawful to taste even for love of life.
21Those in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside, because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring his own provisions that he could legitimately eat, and only to pretend to eat the sacrificial meat prescribed by the king.
Even if, for the time being, I avoid human punishment, I shall never, whether alive or dead, escape the hand of the Almighty.
27Therefore, by bravely giving up life now, I will prove myself worthy of my old age,
28and I will leave to the young a noble example of how to die willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws.‚Äù

He spoke thus, and went immediately to the instrument of torture.
Those who shortly before had been kindly disposed, now became hostile toward him because what he had said seemed to them utter madness.

30When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned, saying: ‚ÄúThe Lord in his holy knowledge knows full well that, although I could have escaped death, I am not only enduring terrible pain in my body from this scourging, but also suffering it with joy in my soul because of my devotion to him.‚Äù
31This is how he died, leaving in his death a model of nobility and an unforgettable example of virtue not only for the young but for the whole nation.

The lesson to learn from this sacrificial life of Eleazar is that we should not be afraid to live our faith out in public. What others think or say should not bother us, we should just trust the Lord and lead by example.
We usually tend to hide our faith in public, however we are called by Jesus to witness to him in public.

Everyone who acknowledges me before others I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.
But whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my heavenly Father. Mat 10:32-33

Remember for the first generation followers of Jesus that meant risking their life. If they crucified Jesus they would also kill anyone who acknowledged him in public.
Even though we may not face death, we can sure face rejection from the world if we acknowledge Christ. Let us pray for strength whenever we are faced with an opportunity to witness.
The people who were pretending to support Eleazer told him that they would give him some other meet instead of swine meat, all he needed to do is consume it in public and then he can do whatever he pleased after that. But Eleazer was not a hypocrite, he was true to his word.
He even offered up his life for the Lord, even though he was very old he was able to bear the torture and death without caving into temptation. Let us pray that we will be filled with similar faith when we are tested.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 303 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 1:12-15
*Do not invite death by the errors of your life, nor bring on destruction by the works of your hands, because God did not make death, nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living.  For he fashioned all things that they might exist, and the creatures of the world are wholesome; There is no destructive poison in them and the dominion of Hades is not on earth, for righteousness is immortal.*

It is our human nature to desire a long life because that is what God has implanted in us. Man was created holy and full of grace to live forever with God in that state.  But because of our fallen nature we desire a long life on earth, without God.
Death came in due to the devil's envy because man and woman were created in the image and likeness of God.

Wisdom 2:12‚Äì22
This is how the wicked people plot against a righteous man who regards himself as God‚Äôs son. They condemn him to a shameful death, but they do not recognize the secret purposes of God, who created man for incorruption.
This is a clearer Messianic prophecy than most.

Wisdom 2:23-24
*God created us to be incorruptible, and made us in the image of his own eternal likeness, but through the devil‚Äôs envy death entered the world, and those who belong to the devil‚Äôs company experience it.*

Jealousy and envy are related but they are clearly distinct.

Jealousy can be good though it rarely is.
Envy is always evil.  It is also one of the 7 deadly sins.

Jealousy causes us to desire what others have, whether it is material possessions, or status, or fame, etc. Jealousy can also cause us to increase our efforts to be equal or better than others. Jealousy must not progress to envy.
Envy causes us to desire the destruction of others. We rejoice in their sufferings and mourn when they prosper.

God calls Himself a jealous God (Exodus 20:5) because when we follow the wrong path, He wants our souls back from Satan so that we don‚Äôt suffer eternal destruction, just as any parent would want their child back from a kidnapper to save the child from possible physical torture and destruction.

He wants us to offer our gifts to Him, from whom we receive them, so that He can bless us.
He wants us to worship and obey Him, who created us in His image, so that we can live in a state of grace and share in His eternal glory.

Envy was, and is, Lucifer's motive that causes him to entice humans to follow his path and thus share in his eternal destruction.
