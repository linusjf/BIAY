### Day 289 No one sees me sin.

When someone wants to commit sin they usually want to cover it up, no one wants the world to know that they are evil. We can try to hide from the world but the Lord‚Äôs eyes are a thousand times brighter than the sun.

The man who dishonors his marriage bed
says to himself, ‚ÄúWho can see me?
Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me,
no one sees me. Who can stop me from sinning?‚Äù
He is not mindful of the Most High,
fearing only human eyes.
He does not realize that the eyes of the Lord,
ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
Observe every step taken
and peer into hidden corners.
The one who knows all things before they exist
still knows them all after they are made. Sirach 23:18-20

We have to remember that God observes every step we take, the God who knows all things before they exist also knows everything about them after they are made. God‚Äôs knowledge of us in unimaginable, He knows when we sit down, rise up, come in and go out, even before a word is on our lips God already knows it. Where can we go from His presence, if we go up to the heavens He is there if we go down to the deepest pit God is there. (Ps 139)

With the realization that God is everywhere we have to watch our actions, given that God knows every word of ours we also have to watch our language.

Do not accustom your mouth to coarse talk,
for it involves sinful speech.
Those accustomed to using abusive language
will never acquire discipline as long as they live. Sirach 23:13,15

Many people have made a habit to curse and use abusive language almost all the time. The explanation they provide is we are all grown-ups so it‚Äôs okay to curse. It‚Äôs not okay to abuse anyone or anything with your language as God is the creator of everyone and God is listening to every word we say.
We should correct our kids when they use abusive language as well as it is easier to correct things at an early stage, before it becomes a bad habit.

‚ÄúAn undisciplined child is a disgrace to its father‚Äù Sirach 22:3

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
