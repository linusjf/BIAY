### Day 305 The desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom

If you are able to keep up with the `Bible in a year` program for so long, I‚Äôm sure your heart is set on wisdom. I‚Äôm sure you seek to know God more and understand His word. Our desire is to know God and love Him.

For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline. Wisdom 6:17

Even if we feel we don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt understand the Bible much, we can be certain that we are on the right track and that our discipline to earnestly desire wisdom is all that God needs.

Desire therefore my words;
long for them and you will be instructed.
Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom,
and she is readily perceived by those who love her,
and found by those who seek her.
13She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her;
14one who watches for her at dawn will not be disappointed,
for she will be found sitting at the gate.

Those of us who desire to know God‚Äôs word and are eager to understand God‚Äôs plan for our lives and His will in all matters will not be disappointed. Wisdom will be found sitting at our gate. We will receive insight like never before. We will be surprised how the Holy Spirit will remind us about scripture and refresh our souls whenever we feel down cast.

For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline; then, care for discipline is love of her;love means the keeping of her laws;To observe her laws is the basis for incorruptibility; and incorruptibility makes one close to God; thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom 6:7-20

We have a beautiful progression of our spiritual life mentioned here in the Book of Wisdom. What starts with an ernest desire for wisdom eventually leads us to the Kingdom.
The steps to the Kingdom as described in the book are listed below.

1. Earnest desire for discipline
2. Which leads to Love of wisdom
3. The love of wisdom means Keeping the laws
4. Keeping the law means incorruptibility
5. and incorruptibility makes one close to God
6. thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom.

Those of us who are seeking God in this program are in fact getting closer to the Kingdom. Even if we are something unfaithful, our God is always Faithful and will lead us to the Kingdom.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
