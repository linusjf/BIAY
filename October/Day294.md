### Day 294 Etiquette shows the Character of a Christian

When we call ourselves Christians, we should also live like Christ. Although bad etiquette is not necessarily a mortal sin, a person with good etiquette will be able to be a better example of Christ.
We are all called to put on Christ and bear witness to his holiness.
There is some good advice on etiquette when you're invited to a party. in Sirach 32

1. DON‚ÄôT BE PUFFED UP WITH PRIDE.

If you are chosen to preside at a dinner, do not be puffed up, but with the guests be as one of them; Sirach 23:1

When people go to a party they usually want to wear the best clothes and drive their costliest car. We see people competing with each other for the best jeweler, clothes and accessories. We can hear people chatting about all their achievements and accomplishments all with a purpose to puff up their pride. Let us talk about Christ and his mercy instead. We are but a wildflower there today and gone tomorrow.

2. SPEAK AT THE RIGHT TIME.

You who are older, it is your right to speak, but temper your knowledge and do not interrupt the singing. Where there is entertainment, do not pour out discourse, and do not display your wisdom at the wrong time. Sirach 32:3-4

We see people speaking out of turn or cutting off the other person to make their voice heard. As a person who speaks Christ‚Äôs words, we cannot be harsh with our tongues. Let our words be well chosen and apt for the moment.

3. SPEAK WISELY AND WHEN NECESSARY.
   Speak, young man, only when necessary, when they have asked you more than once.Be brief, say much in few words; be knowledgeable and yet quiet. Sirach 32:7-8

We should only speak once and have an opinion about things and not argue and debate about what others say. Even though we know more than the other it is sometimes better to be quiet and speak only when people are listening. We also should not be too soft-spoken but speak in the right moderation and with wisdom.

4. HAVE A LIMIT ON YOUR TIME

Leave in good time and do not be the last; go home quickly without delay. Sirach 23:11

Some people want to get drunk and party all night long. We should have a check on time when we are invited to other people's homes and leave early. It‚Äôs just common sense, the host may be tired or have kids that need to sleep.
Let us be the best version we can be and emit the light of Christ wherever we go.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.  üôè
