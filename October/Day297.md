### Day 297 Physicians and Medicine are a blessing from God.

When it comes to doctors and medicine we find people on both sides of the spectrum, some trust only in God and don‚Äôt care for medical treatment, and some only trust in the doctors and medicine without relying on God. When it comes to medical care there are no two ways about it, medical care is from God. The doctor is an instrument of God and healing is only from God, the doctor gives medicine but healing is brought about only by God. There should not be any conflict because it is God who ultimately heals us.

For those who say they don‚Äôt need a doctor they need to read this instruction. I know a few famous preachers who say doctors are not for Christian, Christians should always pray for a miracle.

1. Make friends with the doctor, for he is essential to you;God has also established him in his profession.
2. From God the doctor has wisdom,
   and from the king he receives sustenance.
3. Knowledge makes the doctor distinguished,
   and gives access to those in authority.
4. God makes the earth yield healing herbs
   which the prudent should not neglect;
5. Was not the water sweetened by a twig,
   so that all might learn his power?
6. He endows people with knowledge,
   to glory in his mighty works,
7. Through which the doctor eases pain,
8. and the druggist prepares his medicines.
   Thus God‚Äôs work continues without cease
   in its efficacy on the surface of the earth.
9. My son, when you are ill, do not delay,
   but pray to God, for it is he who heals.

We also have to be careful about thinking that it is the doctor and the medicine that heals and God has nothing to do with it. We need to remember that God is the creator of everything and all wisdom comes from God. So the doctor who eases pain and the druggist who prepares the medicine are all God‚Äôs creations themselves. Also, the herbs and materials used in medicine are a creation of God. No matter how advanced science and technology gets healing is attributed to God alone.

The doctor can treat by only God can heal. We should first pray to God to heal us and for the Lord to guide the minds and hearts of the doctors we visit.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
