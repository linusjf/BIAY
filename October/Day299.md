### Day 299 The hiding and finding of the Ark of the Covenant

In the 2nd book Maccabees which was written around 100 BC, says that the prophet Jeremiah, "being warned by God" before the Babylonian invasion, took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave, informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown "until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy."

The Ark of the Covenant was most important to the Jews as this was where the presence of God could be experienced, it was always placed in the Holy of Holies and only one priest would be assigned to go in and would even faint sometimes because the presence of God was too powerful. The Ark of the Covenant had the 10 commandments, Manna the bread from heaven and Arron‚Äôs staff that blossomed ‚Äì the sign of priesthood. Jeremiah had this all hidden within the cave and it was unmarked. This is that last we will see of the Ark of the Covenant ‚Äì it will never be found until John sees it in the book of Revelations.

Then God‚Äôs temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1

The New Testament has a new Ark of the Covenant which is a person ‚Äì Mother Mary. The new Ark contained the fulfillment of all of what the old Ark contained. The old Ark had 10 commandments the old law/word and the new Ark has Jesus the Word made flesh. The Old Ark had Manna ‚Äì The bread from that fell from Heaven and the new Ark has Jesus the living and true bread that came down from heaven. The Old Ark had Arron‚Äôs staff that blossomed ‚Äì the sign of priesthood and the New Ark had Jesus ‚Äì the great high priest.
We Christians have found the Ark of the Covenant our dear Mother Mary.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
