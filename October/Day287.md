### 287 Loved one‚Äôs not choosing Christ.

The number one concern parents have is their children are not prayerful and are not living a holy life. It can be frustrating to see your kids go astray and make wrong choices in life. Sometimes parents feel as though it would have been better if this prodigal child had never been born in the first place.

Do not yearn for worthless children,
or rejoice in wicked offspring.
Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them
if they do not have fear of the LORD.
Do not count on long life for them,
or have any hope for their future.
For one can be better than a thousand;
rather die childless than have impious children! Sirach 16: 1-3

We see the strong language used here in the Proverbs and may feel that the father in the proverb is too harsh. But I think it can be justified that the father truly wants the good of the child, he wants the child to do good and to have a good future. This is not just applicable for children but can be extended to any relationship, sometimes the children are in the Lord and the parents are away, many a times its one spouse in the Lord and the other one in the world.
Life can get very frustrating when we don‚Äôt see a child, spouse, parent, sibling or friend turning away from the Lord. It can be very painful to see a loved one trapped in addictions and lured into the traps of the world. We may reach a point of depression when we look at them ruin their lives, but we are called to have hope, hope against hope trusting God with every situation and every person. We have to take on the heart of the Father of the prodigal son who waits everyday for his son‚Äôs return. We are to pray and be open to God‚Äôs grace, hoping that the loved one will turn back to the Lord. Let us remember that God waits with us for them, we are not on our own but are partnering with God when we give someone a second chance. Let us ask great saints like St Monica to pray for us to be able to wait for others to change, remember waiting is loving.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
