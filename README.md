## Bible In A Year

### Intro

A daily youtube video will be sent out. We start on Jan 1 & will complete reading the Bible on Dec 31.

1. After listening to the days video, if you feel inspired write down a few points and share it with the group. It could be single word or a whole paragraph.
2. Send your reflections to the group admins, the group admins will select a few reflections everyday.

The format for sharing is as below.

The sharing content can’t be a single word or as long as you wish. It’s really important to share as it motivates the whole group.

Watch this video to get started.
