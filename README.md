## Bible In A Year

### Intro

A daily youtube video will be sent out. We start on Jan 1 & will complete reading the Bible on Dec 31.

1. After listening to the days video, if you feel inspired write down a few points and share it with the group. It could be single word or a whole paragraph.
2. Send your reflections to the group admins, the group admins will select a few reflections everyday.

The format for sharing is as below. 
—————————
BIAY
DayXX - Name 
Sharing Content

The sharing content can’t be a single word or as long as you wish. It’s really important to share as it motivates the whole group.

### A New Beginning ###

The Lord makes all things new and His promises are new every morning. Thank you Lord for the last year and the brand New Year ahead. 
Let us begin our journey through the Bible as one big family, praying for each other everyday. Let’s try our best to stay on track, having a fixed time(20mins) and place will help you make it part of your daily routine. We can do all things in Christ who strengthens us. All the best!!!
