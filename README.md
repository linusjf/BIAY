## Bible In A Year

### Intro

A daily youtube video will be sent out. We start on Jan 1 & will complete reading the Bible on Dec 31.
1. The 2023 group is finishing up the BIAY so the new members may see post like day3XX you can skip them.
2. After listening to the days video, if you feel inspired write down a few points and share it with the group. It could be single word or a whole paragraph.
3. Send your reflections to the group admins, the group admins will select a few reflections everyday.

Watch this video to get started.
