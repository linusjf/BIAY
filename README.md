BIAY January 2024

##### In the Beginning

[![In the Beginning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day001.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BW0gXbEVYgA "In the Beginning")

##### Day 1 *We have God in our DNA* - Michael Eltham

The Bible opens with this great scene of creation, it reveals a bit of God‚Äôs nature ‚Äì God existed before all things and is the source of everything good, everything we know and understand. We see a glimpse of God‚Äôs nature, God is generous - keeps on creating and pouring life into this world. God creates an ordered and good world and puts everything in place and sets rules and boundaries. There is something to be learned from how God organized this world and set it in motion, we should also organize our lives, and set rules and boundaries based on the church's teachings and Sacred Scripture. When we live an organized, harmonious life we feel good, the reason being we were created by God in His own ‚Äúimage‚Äù and ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù ‚Äì we experience wholeness when we have things in order.

Man and woman were created as the "crown of creation" ‚Äì because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.
26 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; Gen 1:26
One important detail here is God said ‚ÄúLet us make humankind‚Äù, we have a Trinitarian God ‚Äì God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not alone, but a harmonious community of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, they are in such beautiful unity that there is no strife or disagreement ‚Äì but with one mind they all create this beautiful world.
We see a reference to the Holy Spirit, a wind from God, that is the breath of God ‚Äì the Holy Spirit.
The Hebrew word "Ruach" means ‚Äúwind,‚Äù ‚Äúbreath,‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit.‚Äù The corresponding Greek word is pneuma. Both words are commonly used in passages referring to the Holy Spirit.
We see the power of the Word of God, with just one Word ‚Äì things were created. The Word of God will have this effect on us as we study it every day in the Bible in a year program. It will create in us an orderly world, setting priorities right and we will end up living a harmonious life in union with the Holy Trinity.
God put his breath into us, and the Holy Spirit was put into our hearts.
then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. Gen 2:7
Since we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness, we receive our good attributes and dignity from God. We have God‚Äôs nature in our DNA, and we naturally have love in our hearts, for Example, a mother naturally loves her newborn and does not need to be taught how to love.
It is at "creation" that the ‚Äúdignity of life‚Äù is given to all human beings, that is why every human being has the dignity of life.
Every human being has the dignity of life because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness and God‚Äôs Spirit/breath was put into us. We should never discriminate based on skin color, race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, every single one in created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.
The explanation of the word ‚Äúhelper‚Äù helps to put things in perspective. God is called helper several times in the Bible and hence helper is not meant to be second class or someone who did menial tasks. Women and Men are both created equal in the image and likeness of God. Let us respect all human beings as everyone has the dignity of life and both men and women are equal.
God does not have Gender ‚Äì we cannot say that God is man or woman. We cannot even categorize God based on gender, God is our creator and He was even before Gender came into this world, God created gender when He made Adam ‚Äì man and Eve ‚Äì woman. When God was incarnate, He was born as a man for a reason. The reason is Jesus is the new Adam, and we the church is the new eve, created from Jesus‚Äô side when his side was pierced. Blood and water flowed out, life-giving blood and water that gave birth to the new Eve ‚Äì the Church.
Side Note: It will help us understand Genesis should if we did not read it chronologically or like a scientific book. Genesis does not aim to give a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe, it‚Äôs more like figurative language to describe real events.
That‚Äôs how the two events(Gen 1 and Gen 2) of the creation of man can be explained. Also things like ‚Äúhow God created light and darkness on day 1 and sun and moon on day 3‚Äù. It is best understood if we read it in figurative language.
Finally, we realize that God is the source of everything good, this should remind us to put him first in everything - He is the beginning. The Alpha and Omega.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 1 - creation - Irene

Something which struck me was

1. God is our Creator. He made us we are his creation the work of his hands.

2. God is good. Everything that He has created is good.

3. He is our source and provider. He has given us everything even before He made us.

4. God is our Helper our ever present help in every need.

5. He is a master planner putting every detail in place.

Our God is an awesome God

Praise God the Father
Praise God the Son
Praise God the Holy Spirit the triune God.

##### Day 1 - Gabriella

Praise God for Fr. Mike so beautifully explaining God's intention for us:
We are made in God's image and we were originally created for labour.
As God freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.
God is a creator so when he puts man and woman in the land he has them work.
*The Lord God made us for labour and leisure. In the creation story we see God working.*
He created the world in 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. God wants us to share in this, to labour, till the land and keep it.
And if God worked for 6 days and rested on the 7th we should follow suit.
Now I understand why my parents instilled in me:
PRAY & WORK = ORA ET LABORA
God bless Fr. Mike for presenting the creation story so clearly. I didn't understand this in such detail before.

##### The Fall of Adam and Eve

[![The Fall of Adam and Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WBg_xK44V0E "The Fall of Adam and Eve")

##### Day 2: *Distrust and Disobedience* - Michael Eltham

Man was made for communion with God, they spoke to God and heard God speak. It was a beautiful harmonious life, and everything was going great for Adam and Eve. As we read in the first chapter of the Catechism of the Catholic Church ‚Äì God created man to share in the blessed life of the Trinity. Adam and Eve were enjoying this beautiful life ‚Äì in direct communion with God.
1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.CCC prologue 1
Now God has planted a garden in Eden and grew various plants with fruit that were pleasing to the eye and to eat. Adam was allowed to eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, ‚ÄúYou may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.‚Äù Gen 2:15-17
Satan is very crafty as we see in Genesis ‚Äì he sows seeds of doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. Satan tries to manipulate the truth and question it and eventually causes us to doubt the truth.
But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not die; 5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5
Satan is proposing that God is a liar and that God does not want our good. According to satan, God didn‚Äôt want them to eat the fruit lest they become like God. This would have caused doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. The serpent described in Genesis is no rat snake, it's more like a Dragon like creature ‚Äì so there is also this element of fear that would have its role to play. Apart from doubt and fear satan eve was also fighting temptations.
So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise Gen 3:6
The fruit was also good to look at, good for the stomach and it made one like God.
She could not resist it anymore, the combined effect of doubt, fear, and temptation. She gave in and gave it to Adam as well, I would have expected Adam to at least resist ‚Äì but it‚Äôs described as though he just eats it. (Like a good husband ;) ‚Äì just joking ). Adam should have stood his ground and resisted the devil.
The main thing that caused their fall was their distrust in God. God gave them everything ‚Äì every tree, every creature and even let them share in His divine life. But they just could not trust God enough. This distrust caused their disobedience. This caused sin to enter mankind.
We can sit and marvel at how stupid our first parents were, but pointing one finger at someone points 4 fingers back at us. Genesis is not a storybook to read and fall asleep over, it‚Äôs the story of our lives. We are faced with the same temptations that Adam and Eve faced, we have doubts, fear, and temptation in our lives.
God has given us the truth in the Word of God and from Church tradition, we know what we ought to do. Yet we doubt it, we fear the consequences, we fear what the world will say, and we give into the temptations of the world. We look at what‚Äôs good for the eye, good for the flesh, and pride ourselves in our wisdom.
The devil does not have his own clay, he just takes what God created and twists the truth into a lie. Satan will take half-truths and add lies to it and put doubt in our hearts, he is the father of lies.
‚ÄúHe was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù Jh 8:44
We sometimes give into the lies of the enemy and give into the temptations of the world. When we commit sin we tend to hide like Adam and Eve we try to cover our sin up.
7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7
I feel this is the first penance that Adam and Eve took on because as we all know fig leaves cause itch. This would have caused severe itch for Adam and Eve when they made loincloths with these leaves. I‚Äôm sure they were aware of this but they felt so upset with themselves and fearful.
Loved Fr Mike‚Äôs explanation of the tone of God for the verse ‚Äì ‚Äúwho told you you were naked?‚Äù The angry tone which most would assume compared to the sympathetic tone. God must have been really hurt - because we didn‚Äôt trust Him but believed the serpent instead.
Let us learn to trust God and his commandments. Man‚Äôs wisdom is foolishness to God, we should stop making up our own rules. If we decide that we can watch sports instead of worship on Sunday or that a fetus in the womb is just tissue ‚Äì we are listening to the lies of satan. We should listen to God‚Äôs voice and trust God fully.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 2 ‚Äì Alice To

Thoughts on action of Adam and the serpent:

1. After creation, God has given Adam dominion over all animals (Gen 1:28). What Adam should have done when the serpent appeared before Eve was to rebuke it, protected Eve and cast the serpent out with his authority. Because of his inaction, Eve succumbed to temptation.
2. The serpent is very clever. It did not do a direct onslaught. It just planted doubt in Eve‚Äôs mind by asking her a question.

As a Christian, we should be aware of our God-given duty. We should always be aware of what our duty and mission is and adhere to it without fail or doubt because our God will not ask us to do things that we are not capable of and He will always be there to guide us along. We should also be aware that temptations, like the serpent will creep up on us without our being aware of it. We should always be vigilant.
Pray each day for protection and guidance from the Holy Spirit and our Mama Mary.

##### Day 2 By Cynthia D'Silva

Genesis 3:4-5
*But the serpent said to the woman, ‚Äúyou will certainly not die. God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, who knows good and evil.‚Äù*
Satan did not change God‚Äôs word. He cleverly twisted the Word and told Adam & Eve to look at God‚Äôs Word through his eyes.
Instead of listening to the devil's interpretation of God‚Äôs Word, Eve should have consulted Adam, who knew better what commandment was given to him by God, and if Adam had any confusion he should have consulted his heavenly Father who gave him the commandment.
We end up in the same situation when we try to interpret God‚Äôs Word on our own without guidance from those who have correct knowledge of the scriptures.

Genesis 3:15
*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.*
By this promise, God gave the guarantee of His divine assistance in protecting Mary and the Church (the Eucharist / the mystical Body of Christ) from Satan.
By this promise it is evident that Mary and Jesus were immaculately conceived, that is, without original sin. Mary‚Äôs holiness was confirmed by Angel Gabriel when he addressed Mary with the words "hail, full of grace‚Äù (‚Äúkecharitomene‚Äù in Greek) (Luke 1:28), which means that Mary was full of grace, like the first Eve before the fall.

[Genesis 3:22-24](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Genesis/3/22-24)

The Garden of Eden was a sanctuary / tabernacle where God dwelt with humans and Adam & Eve were told to leave the holy sanctuary because of the mortal sin which they both committed.
Mortal sin breaks our communion with God and results in ‚Äúspiritual death‚Äù which means ‚Äúeternal suffering (Hell) due to eternal separation from God.‚Äù
At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan. Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state. But when they chose to obey Satan and ate the forbidden fruit, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).
By this they instantly destroyed the divine life within them and consequently lost all the sanctifying graces which were necessary to perfect the human nature. Thus they spiritually damaged and weakened the human soul, putting the human race in the power of Satan. Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.
The Church follows the same principle.
If we receive the fruit (Communion) from the tree of Life (the Cross) when we are in a state of mortal sin we will be subject to eternal damnation (1 Corinthians 11:27-29). When we receive Communion in a state of grace we receive divine life which will give us eternal life after we leave this world (John 6:54).

##### Jenita Maria

1. *God the provider, the most loving Father*
   We understand that.. Even though adam and Eve went Against God's word, and completely disobeyed him, God still loved them through his anger and wrath where he curses them, he still holds them. He takes care of them, and helps them get through their life on earth, to be back with him again for eternity in holiness.

2. *The importance of giving the first fruits to God*

Giving the first hours of your day Or the first fruits of earnings to God shows how much he means to you in your life. We are ever ready to do everything for the person we love, giving the first in everything!! But why should the last few hours or whatever is remaining out of all the abundance God gave us, be given to him back as a sacrifice of love. Love of God is pure and we can only respect God by giving what we love to him.

##### Day 3: Walking with the Lord - Michael Eltham

It is so important for us to have a relationship with God. We are not saved just by being baptized or with church membership or by inheritance - it also depends on how we live our lives.

We all know what Cain did, and how he sinned. Now Adam and Even had another child Seth who is made in Adam‚Äôs image and likeness ‚Äì and Adam was made in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth Gen 5:3

These are the two lines of Adam‚Äôs family Setithe line and Cainite line. The Cainite line seems to be doing evil and the Setithe line are doing good. Even though they are both from the same parent Adam and Eve and grew up in the same home - they turned out so differently. Just being part of a family will not make us good, we have to work hard to become good children as well. We need to teach our children to be good as well.

Now Enoch is a good example from the Setithe line who was good and walked with God. Enoch is the first human being who did not die because he walked so closely with God.

22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. 24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him. Gen 3:22-23

God must have been so close to Enoch that he let him live a long life of 365 years. Enoch apparently did the will of God and probably didn‚Äôt commit many sins. He was so close to God that God didn‚Äôt even let him die, he just took him up out of the earth. Well, how to we know that the verse didn‚Äôt just mean he died and God took him.

Some evidence can be found in Sirach and Hebrews.

ENOCH walked with the LORD and was taken, that succeeding generations might learn by his example. Sirach 44:16

Few on earth have been created like ENOCH; he also was taken up bodily. Sirach 49:14

By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: ‚ÄúHe could not be found, because God had taken him away.‚Äù Heb 11:5

We need to walk with the Lord and not be confirmed to the standards of the world, we should renew our minds with the Word of God.

In this corrupt and sinful world, we need to walk with the Lord as Enoch and Noah did.

Let us be the salt of the world and the light of the world.

May we not just do as the world does but live as God wants us to live, in the world but not of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

God is saying, Noah, make this ark. Because u clinged to me, I will lift you up.

##### Day 3 By Cynthia Dsilva

Genesis 5:24
*After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for 300 years. His whole lifetime was 365 years, then he was no more, because God took him.*
Enoch had an encounter with God when he was 65 years old. Thereafter, for the rest of his life he walked with God. Enoch was not a monk. He was an ordinary family man. Enoch did not have any scriptures or Temple or Church to guide him and yet he was able to walk with God. If Enoch could do it then it should not be difficult for us to walk with God when we have the scriptures and the Church to guide us.

Genesis 6:5-7
*The Lord saw that the people had become wicked and evil. So the Lord said, ‚ÄúI will wipe out from the earth all the human beings I have created.‚Äù*
After God had already declared to Satan that He would put enmity between Satan and the woman (Genesis 3:15), Satan tried to destroy God's plan for redemption by tempting men and women to lead immoral & sinful lives and therefore God had to send the Great Flood and destroy all humanity except Noah and his family because Noah was found to be righteous.

##### The Flood

[![The Flood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day004.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k4ksCrLNO2U "The Flood")

##### Day 4 *Why does God allow evil in the world?* - Michael Eltham

We read how Noah - who walked with God, also listened and did what the Lord commanded him to do. Even though the people around him were doing evil things, Noah did what was right and listened to the instructions of the Lord. Noah built a huge ark according to the detailed instructions from the Lord. Then the Lord asked Noah to take in two of each species of animal.

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him. Gen 6:22

Noah did not care about what the people were talking about him, he did not bother about their opinion. He just did the will of God and listened to the instructions God gave him, even if it seemed foolish or made no sense. Why build a big ark when there was never a flood before or there was no heavy rain? Imagine storing food for a lot of animals and getting them to come into the ark.

People would have laughed at him, but Noah did everything the Lord told him.

We are called to be not only hearers of the word but doers as well (James 1:22~). Also from Mat 7: Everyone who hears the word and does it is a wise man who built his house upon the rock - the rain and the flood did not cause the house to fall.

Noah was a hearer and a doer of the word as well, which is why the water did not destroy him and his family.

Water is used to cleanse things and the great flood wiped out all the evil generation. Only Noah and his family were saved. Because Noah listened to God‚Äôs word and acted upon it, he became a blessing to his family.

We need to be hearers and doers of God's word like Noah. Even if it is at the cost of the whole city laughing at us.

We use water to clean regular things and also used for baptism. John the Baptist called people to be baptized by water in order to prepare for Jesus‚Äôs coming. When Jesus was baptized in the river of Jordan, he was not cleansed by the water but the water was cleansed by Jesus‚Äôs divine touch. The next time we dip our fingers in holy water let us remember that it cleanses us, it‚Äôs sacramental. Just as the flood waters cleansed the human race at a point like John the Baptist baptized in water to prepare us for Jesus, and just as blood and ‚Äúwater‚Äù poured out of the side of Jesus for the purification of the Church. We were baptized and made clean ‚Äì grafted into the body of Christ, the Church.

The image to remember is the Rainbow, it‚Äôs the promise that God made to Noah and to each one of us that He will never destroy us again.

‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. Gen 8:21

I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù 17 God said to Noah, ‚ÄúThis is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù Gen 9: 3-17

The Rainbow is symbolic of God putting down his bow and deciding to never ever destroy us. This is an answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy does God allow evil in the world?‚Äù God is patient and will not act harshly to destroy all evil people. God is patient and hopes that even the evilest people will repent.

God re-established the covenant that he had with Adam, he makes a new covenant with Noah and blesses them ‚ÄúGod blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.‚Äù Gen 9:1

One would think that humans would learn from their mistakes, but no we keep on failing and breaking the covenant over and over again through generations. God did not just destroy all mankind but loved us even more, and sent Jesus ‚Äì His only begotten son.

God will not destroy us but love us more, love us until we repent and turn to Him. Let us not hurt God too much, return to His arms.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 4 Anonymous

1. The foundation between God and man is interwoven with reminder of God's gift of human life. God forbids murder of man.

2. God says you can eat of the animals. Animals are God 's creatures. God entrusted animals to the stewardship of human beings. And it is contrary to human dignity to be cruel to them. This is an issue which troubled me a lot, when I saw humans attacking animals mercilessly.

3. God loves His creation and creatures and we have to be obedient to His commandments. We should never question His ways because He created us and He knows what is best for us. I seek pardon for the times I have knowingly or unknowingly questioned.God, why He created animals to suffer at human hands?

All Glory to The Most Holy Trinity!

##### Day 4 Cynthia D'Silva

Genesis 7:1
Noah started building the ark 100 years before the flood started and not when it started to drizzle or rain. When God said ‚Äúget in‚Äù Noah was so ready.
How ready are we if God says tomorrow ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come home?‚Äù
Are we ready or would we start running around looking for a priest to make our last confession?
We must be ready for eternal lie every day of our earthly life, by being in a state of grace at all times with regular Confession and Communion.

##### Tower of Babel

[![Tower of Babel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day005.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nBoRts9y6Ko "Tower of Babel")

##### Day 5: *Let us make a name for ourselves* - Michael Eltham

Who does not want a good name for themselves, everyone wants the world to love them. We try to be first in sports, business, entertainment, or any field. Now there is no harm in excellence or making a name. But the problem comes when we say ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù or ‚Äúwe did it‚Äù and we take all the credit. We tend to forget that before we could do anything God had to create us and create the world so we have things to create with. Right from the start Adam and Eve wanted to become like God, at least that was the temptation the serpent threw at them.

‚ÄúFor God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5

Satan and the 1/3rd angels fell probably due to the same reason of wanting to be like God.

This tendency to become like God seems to lift its ugly head again in the tower of Babel.

Then they said, ‚ÄúCome, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.‚ÄùGen 11:4

God's grace and mercy are revealed when God came down to confuse their languages. God knew that even if they built a tower into the heavens and reached their highest levels of success they will still not be satisfied. Pride will never be satisfied, it will lead to greed. That is why we see the people who are trying to build a name for themselves will never be satisfied, they will go to any length to reach the top. Once they have reached a good level of success they will not feel satisfied and go into depression.

As St Augustine said - Our hearts will find rest only when we rest in the Lord. Even if we excel in our field of music, art, science, business or any field we will not be satisfied if we are trying to make a name for ourselves. But if lives are rooted in God and we are focused on lifting the name of the Lord higher, we will be blessed beyond our imagination.

We are all called to greatness. To be great saints, we ought to have that as our top priority as St Maximillian Kolbe did. However, it should be for the glory of the Lord and not for our self-interest or our glory.

Let John the Baptist's prayer be our prayer today "He must increase and I must decrease.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Nimrod -the mighty hunter before The Lord, his quest for ambition, power and control, for self-glory.

Forgetting they were created by God. they were planning to build the Tower of Babel and since they were all speaking the same language, it was much easier for them to plan. Thus forgetting they had a Creator who was watching their every move. And rightly God comes down n scatters them all. Their plan could not be established.

That being who we are, being what God wants us to be and being that person well. That gives Glory to God.

##### Day 6: Our struggle with faith - Michael Eltham

We read about Job today, he seems like someone who is living a good life ‚Äì got his priorities right, worships God, and is a good family man. If Gold is tested in the furnace, man is tested with problems, sufferings, trials, and temptations. God allows certain trials in the life of Job, for testing and purification.

God permits satan to take Job‚Äôs possessions, his livestock, property and children all at once.

Then Satan answered the Lord, ‚ÄúDoes Job fear God for nothing? 10 Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 11 But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.‚Äù 12 The Lord said to Satan, ‚ÄúVery well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him!‚Äù So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord. Job 1:9-12.

On seeing the statue of Mother Mary in my home the HVAC contractor struck up a conversation with me about religion, he stopped going to church after he lost his wife to cancer. His wife was a devout catholic and did nothing wrong her whole life, he asked ‚Äúwhy would God want to give such a good person cancer?‚Äù. Well, we may never know the reason why we are given so many sufferings in life, but we need to rely on the fact that God is in control and we face sufferings for our spiritual growth. Most people would curse God and stop praying if they lost their job, property and kids. But this caused Job to worship God.

20 Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground and worshiped. 21 He said, ‚ÄúNaked I came from my mother‚Äôs womb, and naked shall I return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.‚ÄùJob 1:20-21

We need to learn an attitude toward losing something. Job said the Lord gave the Lord took it away. Let us learn to be thankful in every situation. Even if there are multiple things going wrong in our lives we should continue to entrust ourselves to the Lord. Just continue to pray and know that God is good, even if we have many misfortunes in life. For the Lord will restore everything in our lives and even multiply our blessings if we trust Him. This song drives the point home.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![God's Covenant with Abram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day007.jpg)](https://youtu.be/up30wE2u-AI "God's Covenant with Abram")

##### Day 7: *What‚Äôs the difference between a contract and a covenant?* - Michael Eltham

A contract is an agreement for the exchange of goods and services however a covenant is the exchange of person itself - I belong to you and you belong to me. That is why a marriage is not a contract but a covenant, not the exchange of goods but the giving of oneself to the other.

The word of the Lord came to Abram, that he will be receive a great reward. He was promised children as great as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Abram had faith and knew that even though he was getting old and had no children, God would provide. But sometimes Abram had questions.

But Abram said, ‚ÄúLord GOD, what can you give me, if I die childless and have only a servant of my household, Eliezer of Damascus?‚Äù

3Abram continued, ‚ÄúLook, you have given me no offspring, so a servant of my household will be my heir.‚Äù Gen 15:2,3

The Lord answered Abram with a covenant promise.

He answered him: Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10He brought him all these, split them in two, and placed each half opposite the other; but the birds he did not cut up.

12As the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great, dark dread descended upon him.

13 Then the LORD said to Abram: Know for certain that your descendants will reside as aliens in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.

14But I will bring judgment on the nation they must serve, and after this they will go out with great wealth.

15You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace; you will be buried at a ripe old age.

16In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the wickedness of the Amorites is not yet complete.

17When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch, which passed between those pieces.

18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River, the Euphrates,

19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,

20the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

21the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. Gen 15:10-21

Just trying to visualize the scene can uplift our spirits. Although it may seem strange how God asked Abram to bring the three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon there has to be a deeper meaning to it related to the prescribed sacrifices. The beauty of God speaking visually was incredible how the sunset caused a smoking pot and flaming torch to pass through the two pieces. Following this, the Lord made a covenant with Abram and gave him a timeline of events of his life and his descendants.

We may have our own questions and doubts about our life and we should. We should battle with our questions and seek the Lord for answers. Questions and doubts may cause us to be anxious and worried. It is okay to have questions and concerns but we should not despair.

We should remember God‚Äôs promises to us and not be afraid or anxious about anything. God‚Äôs promise to never destroy mankind again with a flood, His promise to never leave us or abandon us, His promise to be with us always till the end of days, His promise that we will never be in want, His promise of protecting, His promise to anoint us head with oil, His promise for a Savior, His promise that he will prepare a place for us in his Father‚Äôs House, His promise to send us the Holy Spirit - our helper, our advocate and counselor, the List goes on and on. Let us not fear - but trust in Our faithful God.

Let us remember that God has made a covenant with us to save us, so have no fear.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 8: *Taking things into our own hands* - Michael Eltham

Patience, Perseverance, Faith, Trust, Hope are a few words the sprung up when I heard the word spoken to us today.

We know that God made a covenant with Abram, that his descendants would be as many as the stars in the sky and they would conquer the lands for many generations. But both Abram and Sarai are getting older and there seem to be no signs of children.

Thus, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, his wife Sarai took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

4He had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. As soon as Hagar knew she was pregnant, her mistress lost stature in her eyes.

5 So Sarai said to Abram: ‚ÄúThis outrage against me is your fault. I myself gave my maid to your embrace; but ever since she knew she was pregnant, I have lost stature in her eyes. May the LORD decide between you and me!‚Äù Gen 16:3-5

Sarai gets impatient and takes things into her own hands - makes Abram follow her plan and gets mad at him all within few verses. She suggests the Abram would have children with Hagar the maid. Like a good husband üòÖ Abram listens to his wife. We see how things go south very fast.

The lesson here is nothing good comes out of taking things into our own hands - we need to wait on the Lord, no matter how long it takes. Like in the story of Job where he is surrounded by friends who keep accusing him. Job just wants a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen

Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. James 1:19-20

May be we need to become better listeners as many people just want to be heard in this world today.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 8 By Cynthia Dsilva

Genesis 17:12
*Why did babies have to be circumcised on the 8th day?*
God created the world in 6 days and consecrated it on the 7th day, but the first creation could not achieve its goal because sin entered it and the first Covenant was not renewable.

Therefore, circumcision was a foreshadow of the new creation which started on the 8th day of the first creation (Easter Sunday) when Jesus discarded His mortal flesh (the flesh of the first Adam) and received His own immortal flesh.

Circumcision was also a fore shadow of baptism which makes us new creations because we discard our old sinful selves and enter the new Covenant which started on the 8th day of the first creation.

In the old Covenant, a circumcised man had an obligation to ensure that all his male descendants were circumcised.

Since baptism replaced circumcision, in the new Covenant, baptized parents have an obligation to ensure that all their descendants are baptized.

When a child is baptized, he/she receives the family name (surname) of the earthly father and thus becomes a member if his family. And simultaneously, the child also becomes a member if our heavenly Father‚Äôs family.

Genesis 17:15-16
After the fall of the first king (Adam) and queen (Eve) God was waiting to re-establish His Kingdom on earth. But God was not just interested in working with a man alone. When God stepped up to re-establish His Covenant, He gave us a hint of His plan for the monarchy of His Kingdom by moving from Adam to Abraham, and from Eve to Sarah, because Sarah‚Äôs womb would bear the earthly son of the promise who would be the ancestor of kings and queens.
The future Davidic kingdom was, therefore, to be a restoration of what God had established in the creation kingdom.

##### Day 9: *Abraham is a good model for intercessory prayer.* - Michael Eltham

The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were committing grave sins and they were going to be destroyed. Abraham starts pleading with the Lord to save those people.

Then Abraham drew near and said: ‚ÄúWill you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

24Suppose there were fifty righteous people in the city; would you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people within it?

25Far be it from you to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike! Far be it from you! Should not the judge of all the world do what is just?‚Äù

26The LORD replied: If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.

27Abraham spoke up again: ‚ÄúSee how I am presuming to speak to my Lord, though I am only dust and ashes!

28What if there are five less than fifty righteous people? Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?‚Äù I will not destroy it, he answered, if I find forty-five there.

29But Abraham persisted, saying, ‚ÄúWhat if only forty are found there?‚Äù He replied: I will refrain from doing it for the sake of the forty.

30Then he said, ‚ÄúDo not let my Lord be angry if I go on. What if only thirty are found there?‚Äù He replied: I will refrain from doing it if I can find thirty there.

31Abraham went on, ‚ÄúSince I have thus presumed to speak to my Lord, what if there are no more than twenty?‚Äù I will not destroy it, he answered, for the sake of the twenty.

32But he persisted: ‚ÄúPlease, do not let my Lord be angry if I speak up this last time. What if ten are found there?‚Äù For the sake of the ten, he replied, I will not destroy it.

33The LORD departed as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned home. Gen 18:23-33

Just reading the episode is a good lesson on Intercessory prayer. We see how Abraham pleads on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah, he calls on the mercy of God. He knows that the people were sinful but he also knew that God‚Äôs Mercy is far greater than their sin. Abraham was able to eventually save Lot and his daughters. Remember God hears the prayer of a righteous man. We need to be Intercessors and prayer worriers - praying for our world. Let us not give up but persistently pray for God to hear our prayers. Even if we have to pray for people who do not deserve God‚Äôs love, we should pray with all our zeal and trust in God‚Äôs mercy and grace.

Lot‚Äôs daughters get desperate and commit a grave sin.

The firstborn said to the younger: ‚ÄúOur father is getting old, and there is not a man in the land to have intercourse with us as is the custom everywhere.

Come, let us ply our father with wine and then lie with him, that we may ensure posterity by our father.‚Äù Gen 19:31,32

This is how they both conceived children from their own father.

Lessons to be learned from Lot‚Äôs daughters - they thought that there were no more men in the world and they had to have children from their own father- the Bible does not call it out as a sin but ‚Äúshows it a sin‚Äù and a big mistake, as the descendants of the two sons born became the Moabites and the Ammonites. The two big enemies of the Israelites.

We should learn a life lesson from this, never get over anxious and think that our world is upset down, there is no way out, no solution etc - we tend to make big mistakes when we are guided by fear and anxiety. Let us intercede instead and pray for the situation, knowing that God will make a way.

May we trust in the Lord always.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 9 - Jenita

Not every problem that we go through has an answer at the end.. We may wonder why we faced those problems even when we have been good and righteous like Job.

But even when such doubts arise it is important to know that the journey is important.. And with whom that journey is made is a little more important.

God is faithful, he will spare the wicked for the sake of the innocent.

##### Day 10: *God will protect us even if when we mess up.* - Michael Eltham

We usually idealize people in the Bible and assume that they always had faith and never doubted. Our father in Faith Abraham himself failed. He lies about Sarah being his sister for fear of them taking her away. Abraham acted out of fear instead of faith.

From there Abraham journeyed on to the region of the Negeb, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he resided in Gerar as an alien,

2Abraham said of his wife Sarah, ‚ÄúShe is my sister.‚Äù So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.

3But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him: You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she has a husband.

4Abimelech, who had not approached her, said: ‚ÄúO Lord, would you kill an innocent man?

5Was he not the one who told me, ‚ÄòShe is my sister‚Äô? She herself also stated, ‚ÄòHe is my brother.‚Äô I acted with pure heart and with clean hands.‚Äù

6 God answered him in the dream: Yes, I know you did it with a pure heart. In fact, it was I who kept you from sinning against me; that is why I did not let you touch her.

7So now, return the man‚Äôs wife so that he may intercede for you, since he is a prophet, that you may live. If you do not return her, you can be sure that you and all who are yours will die.

8Early the next morning Abimelech called all his servants and informed them of everything that had happened, and the men were filled with fear. Gen 18:1-8

God intervened and saved Abraham and Sarah, they were blessed with land and money.

Sometimes we may get afraid and lie or commit sin out of fear.

We should not give up easily because God will save us.

Even though we are weak He is strong, even though we fail He is faithful to uphold us.

St Paul was troubled by a thorn in his flesh and asked God to take it away. However, the Lord answered - Strength is made perfect in weakness, My grace is sufficient for you. Do not be disheartened or discouraged the Lord is on our side.

If He is for us what can be against us.

Jesus came into the world not to condemn us but to save us. Let us be strengthened and be reassured that the Lord will pick us up when we fall.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 10: Reflection (Chapter 20) By Joice Pereira

11‚ÄúAbraham replied, ‚ÄúI said to myself, ‚ÄòThere is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.‚Äô

Abraham and Sarah settled in Gerar on the way to Negeb while, there, Abraham pretended that Sarah was his sister, and King Abimelech of Gerar took Sarah for himself. But God wants Abimelech in a dream that he will die if he approaches Sarah, he must return Sarah to Abraham, who is a prophet and will pray for him. Abimelech did fear God. All it took was a dream and he was immediately to do what was right.

The Bible reveals that Job was a man who ‚Äúfeared God ‚Äú. Job lost his children, wealth, and health but in it all, he never spoke disrespectfully about God. We read that in all this, Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.

Fear of the Lord will keep us from sin. All kinds of good will flow into the life of the person who fears the Lord.

##### The Sacrifice of Isaac

[![The Sacrifice of Isaac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day011.jpg)](https://youtu.be/51FQLxXX5Rw "The Sacrifice of Isaac")

##### Day 11: *God is always on time.* - Michael Eltham

Faith on display, Abraham is called the Father of Faith because he trusted the Lord, to the extent of losing the thing Abraham loved the most, his son. Isaac was the promise of God and the only hope for Abraham to have descendants as many as the stars in the sky and sand on the seashore.

Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test and said to him: Abraham! ‚ÄúHere I am!‚Äù he replied.

2Then God said: Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There offer him up as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you.

3Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey, took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac, and after cutting the wood for the burnt offering, set out for the place of which God had told him.

Gen 22:1-3

If I was Abraham I would not have not got any sleep that night knowing that I would have to sacrifice my son the next day.

So Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two walked on together,

7Isaac spoke to his father Abraham. ‚ÄúFather!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHere I am,‚Äù he replied. Isaac continued, ‚ÄúHere are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?‚Äù

8‚ÄúMy son,‚Äù Abraham answered, ‚ÄúGod will provide the sheep for the burnt offering.‚Äù Then the two walked on together.Gen 22: 6-8

Isaac carrying the wood up the mount is a prefiguration of Jesus carrying the wood of the cross up Calvary. Isaac‚Äôs question ‚ÄúHere are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?‚Äù would have broken Abraham‚Äôs heart. I admire Abraham‚Äôs faith here when he said that God will provide.

When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he bound his son Isaac, and put him on top of the wood on the altar.

10Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son. Gen 22:9-10

Even though Isaac was in his 30s and was able to overpower his father and run away. He decided to trust his father. Just how Jesus prayed for the cup of suffering to be taken away, but not His will but the will of the Father be done. We need to cultivate this bond of trust with the Father. We need to know that God has plans for us not to harm us, but for our welfare. Even though we may not see it, we need to trust him.

But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, ‚ÄúAbraham, Abraham!‚Äù ‚ÄúHere I am,‚Äù he answered.

12‚ÄúDo not lay your hand on the boy,‚Äù said the angel. ‚ÄúDo not do the least thing to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you did not withhold from me your son, your only one.

Abraham‚Äôs faith was tested and he passed. God was only testing Abraham to see if he really loved God. Abba Father would have know how Abraham was feeling for God knows everything the past, present and future. Abba Father‚Äôs heart would have broken when Jesus died on the cross for us.

Abraham knew that God who created everything out of nothing can even bring his son back to life, so he was willing to sacrifice Isaac. We all know the story how a ram was found in the bushes and Abraham sacrificed it.

Pondering today‚Äôs scripture a question that I asked myself was would I do it - would I be ready to sacrifice my son?? I came up with a big "No".

We should take some time to sit down and see what our attachments are? Pray that we choose God above everything else.

Abraham was a great man - hoping against hope he trusted the Lord and the Lord blessed him with a son who had much faith in his father.

For faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see(Heb11:1). We need to remember what God said ‚ÄúFor my thoughts are not your thoughts,

neither are your ways my ways," (Isaiah 55:8).

Just trust Him and have faith that He is in control of everything, even though the situation seems hopeless. God‚Äôs timing is perfect and God will always step in just in time. So do not give up even if everything seems lost, just trust in Him and God will provide.

Lord, I trust in you ‚Äì I am also Hoping against Hope.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 11 Jennie James

Gen:22 The Sacrifice of Isaac

God tests Abraham by asking him to offer his Isaac, his only son (this Son whom Sarah and Abraham waited for so long to receive)

Abraham obeys God's command and he gets up, takes his son and prepares whatever is necessary for a sacrifice.

22:5 Abraham asks the two men traveling with them to wait
The verse which truly makes Abraham justified in the eyes of God is "*Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship and then we will come back to you "*

And in another line 22:8 (When Isaac asks Abraham) "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the Lamb for the sacrifice?" \*Abraham replies "God himself will provide the lamb for the sacrifice."

Abraham believed that God will make him a great nation and God's constant assurance that only through Isaac that God's covenant will be established.
Abraham never doubted God's word (the above highlighted verses is the Faith that Abraham has in God).

Galatians 2:6 St. Paul writes about the faith of Abraham "Remember Abraham: he believed God and because of this was held to be a just man"

##### Isaac and Rebekah

[![Isaac and Rebekah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day012.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2lsnIGtU4Zg "Isaac and Rebekah")

##### Day 12: *Dedication to daily devotion and work.* - Michael Eltham

The story of Isaac and Rebekah seems so smooth and as though they had a full revelation of God‚Äôs plan for their lives. But it was not so - it only seems so to the readers of their story.

Abraham commissioned his servant to go find a bride from among his own people (Israelites, relatives) as they were staying in pagan land. The servant prayed the below prayer.

While I stand here at the spring and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water,

14if I say to a young woman, ‚ÄòPlease lower your jug, that I may drink,‚Äô and she answers, ‚ÄòDrink, and I will water your camels, too,‚Äô then she is the one whom you have decided upon for your servant Isaac. In this way I will know that you have dealt graciously with my master.‚Äù Gen 24:13-14

Until the day when Abraham's servant went in search of a bride, Rebekah was doing her mundane tasks of fetching water from the well. We heard the story she kindly gave a drink to servant and his camels. She was willing to even go with the servant to a far off place to meet Isaac.

One day toward evening he went out to walk in the field, and caught sight of camels approaching. Gen 24:63

Until the day the servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac would go to the fields to meditate and pray. Walk in the field can be related to praising God like God walked with Adam and even in the garden of Eden. "In the evening" is a time of rest when the day‚Äôs work is done and one turns to worship.

Sometimes while waiting for God to answer our prayer, we get impatience and complain and crib about the situation. Like Job we don't see God's providence working in our lives - we only see all the problems and misfortunes in our life. We even wonder why this is happening to me.

We are called to persevere in prayer like Isaac, daily drawing from the well - like Rebekah, we need to draw from the well of the Sacraments - Eucharist, Confession, the Bible, personal prayer, community prayer.

Even if we don't understand what‚Äôs going on like Job, we need to keep on doing the right thing and the Lord will provide. We will see at the end of the book of Job, how the Lord provides - much more than what Job initially had.

But for now, we need to keep journeying with Job and feel the pain and struggle.

Let's keep trusting in God's providence.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 12 Anonymous

##### Esau Sells His Birthright

[![Esau Sells His Birthright](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day013.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Tg5f77arXqQ "Esau Sells His Birthright")

##### Day 13 Selling our inheritance for temporal pleasure

Isaac and Rebecca were happily married but they did not have any children. God had promised Abraham descendants as many as the stars in the sky so it‚Äôs really important that Isaac has children. Although Abraham had children with Hagar his servant and other concubines, the lineage for Jesus should come through Abraham and Isaac. As we journey through the Bible we will see how the lineage is established from Adam to Jesus.

We will see how Isaac‚Äôs son Jacob will have 12 sons who‚Äôs descendants will become the 12 tribes of Israel.

Isaac entreated the LORD on behalf of his wife, since she was sterile. The LORD heard his entreaty, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.

But the children jostled each other in the womb so much that she exclaimed, ‚ÄúIf it is like this, why go on living!‚Äù She went to consult the LORD,

23and the LORD answered her:

Two nations are in your womb, two peoples are separating while still within you;

But one will be stronger than the other,

and the older will serve the younger. Gen 25:21-23

Right from conception the situation seems like the twins will always be at odds, jostling each other, one is stronger and one older will serve the younger. Even at birth, we see the younger one Jacob holding on to the heel of Esau.

The first to emerge was reddish, and his whole body was like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.

26Next his brother came out, gripping Esau‚Äôs heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. Gen 25: 25-26

Esau was a good hunter and Jacob was a simple man, Rebecca preferred Jacob and Isaac Esau because he was fond of the game he caught.

Once, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.

30He said to Jacob, ‚ÄúLet me gulp down some of that red stuff; I am famished.‚Äù That is why he was called Edom.

31But Jacob replied, ‚ÄúFirst sell me your right as firstborn.‚Äù

32‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Esau, ‚ÄúI am on the point of dying. What good is the right as firstborn to me?‚Äù

33But Jacob said, ‚ÄúSwear to me first!‚Äù So he sold Jacob his right as firstborn under oath.

Gen 25:29-33

Esau did not regard his firstborn right too much which is why he sold it a meal. Also Jacob wanted to sneak his way into the blessing that was meant for Esau the eldest.

The only outcome I can draw from this is that we humans are broken, we can place ourselves in the shoes of both brothers. We are so greedy that we want to get anything we see or desire. We are also so negligent about our inheritance, we so easily sell our birthright as children of God for something very temporal and fleeting.

We are blinded like Esau and can only see the temporal benefits instead of the great blessings of being a child of God. We sell our inheritance for petty sins of greed, lust, pride‚Ä¶

Let us preserve our inheritance of being God‚Äôs children, never giving into the glitter of temporal pleasure. This world and all its pleasures are passing away.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 13 - Gabriella

Dear Lord,
Teach us and inspire us to recognize our own brokenness and to avoid repeating what our ancestors have done over and over. Help us recognize our own wrongdoings and take the path you have planned for us.

##### Day 14: ‚ÄúWe are not perfect‚Äù - Michael Eltham

The Jews were God‚Äôs chosen people and we the Christians were grafted into God‚Äôs chosen people. In fact, Jesus come not only for the Jews but for everyone. Anyone who hears His voice and responds will be grafted in by Baptism, where we become Children of God.

Just as the blessing of Isaac is irreversible- even the sacraments are irreversible - once a Child of God - always a Child of God. Even if we become deceptive and steal like Jacob we are still God‚Äôs children. Though Jacob can justify himself because he actually bought the birthright of Esau for a lentil meal. But he deceived his father by wearing his brothers‚Äô clothes‚Äô and putting goat skin on his hands, he also lied to his father when he said he was Esau. His mother Rebekah was the one who helped him deceive his father.

The only conclusion we can come to is that we are all messed up. We are all in need of redemption.

The good news is that God loves us no matter what - we usually think that if we commit sin we lose our value and God does not love us anymore, in fact, it‚Äôs the opposite - the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the lost. When the ‚Äúone lost‚Äù is found there is rejoicing in heaven. Let us not run away from His love, all we need to do is be found by him. He stands at the door and knocks - if anyone hears His voice - He will come in and dine with us. If you hear God‚Äôs voice do not harden your hearts today.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 15: ‚ÄúWhat goes around comes around.‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We see how Jacob the younger brother tricked Esau to get the birthright and the blessing - a few chapters back. Now Jacob gets tricked by Laban his father-in-law, who promises Rachel the younger daughter if Jocob works for 7 years, he tricks him into marrying Leah. Jacob has to work another 7 years to marry the one he loves Rachel.

As we hear all that went down between the two wives Leah and Rachel trying to win the love of Jacob, we can draw a few conclusions - that

1. it‚Äôs such a mess

2. God is always on the side of those who are hated/deprived.

Leah was tolerated/hated by her husband and the Lord blessed her by opening her womb and Rachel remained barren. However, the Lord did bless Rachel later on and opened her womb(probably after she turned to the Lord).

Leah tried very hard to gain her husband's love - naming 3 children (in lines with my husband will Love Me) Many times spouses feel unloved, we need to pray and invite the Lord into the marriage and carry our cross until the Lord blesses our spouse. Let us rest assured that God will make something beautiful out of our mess, just as the twelve tribes of Israel were born amidst all the strife between Jacob and his two wives(the sisters).

We need to also invite the Lord in all our relationships, on our own we will make a mess of our marriage, as humans we are flawed. The Key is to invite the Lord into the relationships. 3 to a good marriage. The two spouses centered on the Lord. God will make something beautiful out of the mess we have created.

##### Day 15 - Rosetta -

Today we see that God loves us no matter how broken and unloved we may feel with our own loved ones and those whom we keep close to our hearts. His love is omnipresent and is the only love that truly satisfies our soul. We also see that more than wealth and all materialistic things that we want and desire, ultimately as human beings at the core we long for love and acceptance. This is seen in the stories of both Leah & Job as they seek for love, approval and validation from their family (Leah - Jacob) and friends (Job).

##### Day 15 By Simitra

It's Ok to know that right now there is some brokenness in our lives and that God can still use it.

We don't have to beat ourselves due to our brokenness but can instead grow in the awareness that we are already loved and are heirs to everything that belongs to the Father through Christ Jesus.

##### Day 16: "If God is for us who can be against us" Rom 8:31 -Michael Eltham

In today's reading Jacob hears God's voice calling him back to his Father's house - remember Jacob left in fear after stealing the blessing from his elder brother Esau. In a sense, Jacob had to deal with his deceptive and manipulative father-in-law Laban for many years. No matter how Laban tried to steal by changing what type of cattle belonged to him, God kept prospering Jacob's flock.

Finally, Jacob stirred by God's message decided to take all that he had and leave. Laban persuaded him "BUT" the Lord had put a hedge around Jacob. Laban could not lay a hand on Jacob(Because the Lord told Laban not to). "If the Lord is for us who can be against us". "No harm will come near our tent" "A thousand may fall on your right 10K on your left - but nothing can befall us" "No weapon formed against us shall prosper" and "He puts His angels in charge of us" "They patrol around us day and night" In the reading, we see Jacob meets the army of Angles. Let us not fear, but take refuge in the Lord. "He is our fortress and stronghold. In His arms we are safe."

##### Day 17: Why does a good God allow evil?

This is a fundamental question that many ask. In today's reading, we see how the daughter of Jacob was raped by the prince of the land. The bible states that this is not to happen, it clearly says that rape is not moral and is a sin. When Jacobs's sons heard of their sister's rape they were furious and deceived the prince and all males of the land and eventually killed them all. The question "Where is God when all of this is happening?" is one that comes to our mind. Is it just for that man to rape an innocent girl? Was it just for her brothers to be vengeful and murder all the men of the land?

We need to understand that this feeling of justice comes from the Lord, it's not our own. We long for a world where there is no injustice, and where no one is harmed or deceived. The bad news is that we may never see such a world as every human being has a deceptive heart and we are devouring each other. The only hope is heaven, our desire for justice will be fulfilled in heaven. Heaven will be that perfect place where there is no scorching sun, no pain or tears. Just the presence of the Lord. He will reign in Justice and Peace.

However, we should strive to make Earth like heaven, starting with ourselves. We should mean it when we pray "Thy kingdom come, they will be done on earth as in heaven."

##### Day 17 Simitra

Genesis 33:10 is so profound. Jacob says to Essau, "to see you is to see the face of God". Why? Inspite of the wrong that Jacob did by deceit, yet when Essau forgives him and receives him back, he compares his act to that of God.

Just as God in Christ Jesus has forgiven us, when we forgive, our face is the reflection of God himself.

Mk 3:7-12

In the gospel, we see people giving Jesus an enthusiastic reception after hearing about the things He was doing. People converged on Him like a pilgrimage in faith. The hurdles on their way were no longer barriers but stepping stones to have a divine experience.

Are you ready to walk an extra mile to meet or encounter Jesus?

Wake up from your spiritual slumber! Give up the unnecessary luggage. Look up to Jesus. And with every step, build up your relationship with Him and with others

God is faithful to his promises. It is impossible that God should prove false. The Bible is full of God's promises and all of them are a ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù in Christ Jesus.

##### Day 18 "God is Faithful, even though we are not faithful." - Michael Eltham

As we read through the readings today. Names, names, and more names. It gets to that point where we can't even focus on the reading with all those names. However, we need just step back and look at how God works His will out. Abraham the man who had no kids till 99 is now becoming the father of the nations. His children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are being fruitful and multiplying. God gives Jacob a new name "Isreal" and 12 sons who become the 12 tribes of Isreal. The blessing of the Lord is on the family for generations, they prosper and their flock and lands are blessed.

‚ÄúNo one or nothing can change what God intends for us. He is a faithful God, what His hand does no one can stop. Let us feel confident today that God is in control of every situation, we are in His Hands.‚Äù - Michael Eltham

Even though things seem not going right today (like Job), let us not lose hope for we have a Faithful God.

"Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." Is 49:15

‚ÄúForever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens. Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.‚Äù Psalm 119:89-90

"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." Prov 3:5

##### Joseph and His Brothers

[![Joseph and His Brothers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day019.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9aHl8VnadXw "Joseph and His Brothers")

##### Day 19 Jealousy, Envy, and Resentment are the perfect ingredients for a "Mess". - Michael Eltham

Jacobs's sons were envious of their youngest brother "Joseph" because their father loved Joseph more than them. Joseph was the son of Rachel (the wife whom Jacob loved). The brothers did not stop at envy - they wanted to kill him but sold him instead and lied to their father.

We tend to think that - we would have never done it. We need to remember that we are all human and not superior to them. We should just be grateful that God has kept us from sin. We need to be thankful for our parents, siblings, spouse, children, teachers... We are responsible for not only listening to our conscience but also for "forming" it.

We have to learn life lessons from these stories in the Bible, read His Word, and transform our lives. We need to keep Jealousy in check least it becomes 'Envy' and 'Resentment' and 'deadly'.

Let us pray the prayer from the Psalms.

" Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. " Psalm 19:13

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 19 Simitra

Genesis 37:11, "So his brothers were jealous of him". Every action that we take is first perceived in the mind. That's why Romans 12:2 tells us to "be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect".

James 3:16,"For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind". The jealousy of Joseph's brothers allowed them to go to the extent of selling their own brother as a slave.

Let us ask for God's grace to be vigilant knowing what an evil jealousy is.

##### Day-19 Anonymous

Joseph - beloved of Israel. His brother's are jealous. Because of this distortion, because of this jealousy, someone else has something that we believe is ours, should be ours. In this case, it is the father's love. They are not wrong. They are wrong in choosing resentment.
Life is a gift. We can't say it is owed to us. It is merely something that I can receive as a gratitude.

##### Day 19 - Jealousy

Everytime a situation arises where all my human weaknesses such as anger, jealousy, vengeance or greed are hightened, the lines of a song *"make me a channel of your peace"* remind me to be humble and calm me down

" Oh master grant that i may never seek
So much to be consoled as to console
To be understood, as to understand
To be loved as to love with all my soul"

These lines hold such deep meaning, and is very much in line with today's reading from Genesis as well. The brother's, by putting themselves before the other have led themselves to committng a crime. Had they for a moment, paused and put Joseph Or Israel before them, such a situation would not have come by.

Selfishness of feeding ones ego and desire lead to evil acts unfavorable to God.

So.. Each time we want out hearts or our desires to be fulfilled. Each time we feel we need more we don't have enough or are not given enough, we need to remind ourselves of these lines.

"For it is in giving that we receive"

##### Judah and Tamar

[![Judah and Tamar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day020.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IxMOWEohb6s "Judah and Tamar")

##### Day 20: "Onanism" and "Double standards" - Michael Eltham

Note: Today‚Äôs reflections is for mature audience only.

Separating the unitive act from the procreative act is "Onanism". For the very first time, the Bible states this sin - which is very prevalent today with the use of contraceptives and birth control. We decide to be God when we use contraceptives and birth control, instead of letting God be in control, the Bible says that the son who committed this sin made God angry and Onan was slain.

But Er, Judah‚Äôs firstborn, greatly offended the LORD; so the LORD took his life.

Then Judah said to Onan, ‚ÄúHave intercourse with your brother‚Äôs wife, in fulfillment of your duty as brother-in-law, and thus preserve your brother‚Äôs line.‚Äù

Onan, however, knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he had intercourse with his brother‚Äôs wife, he wasted his seed on the ground, to avoid giving offspring to his brother.

10What he did greatly offended the LORD, and the LORD took his life too. Gen 38:7-10

The church recommends married people follow Natural family planning. All married people should be open to life and not commit sins of Onamism, or anything that prevents natural conception. Single people are called to a life of absolute abstinence until married.

We also look at extreme brokenness and the sad story of Tamar. Judah's double standard is on display today. He does not hesitate to indulge with Harlot's and when he finds out that Tamar his daughter-in-law is pregnant with a child from Harlotry he wants her burnt. Don't we sometimes have double standards - we are hypocrites - we preach one thing and don't follow it. We condemn those who commit sin even though we secretly do it ourselves. We will need to eat "humble pie" on the day of Judgment - when everything will be brought to the light. Like when Tamar exposed Judah's sin - he said that she is more righteous than I. We need to admit that we are sinful, we need to change on the "inside", for

"the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?" Jer 17:9.

BUT God can write straight with crooked lines. God can use broken vessels like us to do great things. Let us entrust our broken humanity to Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 20 Simitra

Proverbs 3:28, "Do not say to your neighbor, ‚ÄúGo, and come again,
tomorrow I will give it‚Äù‚Äîwhen you have it with you.

In Genesis 12:2, God told Abram, "I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing".

Gal 3:29, "And if you are Christ‚Äôs, then you are Abraham‚Äôs offspring, heirs according to promise.

Each one of us who believe in Jesus Christ are Abraham's offspring and we receive the blessing, however we are to remember that God has blessed us to be a blessing.

Let us not put aside what we can do for others when it is in our power, for we are just the stewards of the Lord and God is the source of all things.

##### Walking with God

[![Walking with God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day021.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RV2ZyWevslI "Walking with God")

##### Day 21: "Joseph the just" - Michael Eltham

We see so many similarities between Joseph of the Old Testament and our dear St Joseph of the New Testament. Both had dreams and God communicated with them very clearly in their dreams. Both were forced to go to Egypt. Both were just men. We see how OT Joseph is chaste and does not succumb to the repeated advances of his master‚Äôs wife, he even fled from her.

St Joseph of the NT is called out as a just man in the NT. According to tradition he had pledged his virginity to the Lord and wanted to live a life dedicated to the Lord‚Äôs service. We need to learn from both the Josephs to preserve our life from ‚Äúthe lust of the eyes, the lust of the world and pride of life.‚Äù

We need to flee from sin. ‚ÄùBe alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour ‚Äù 1Pet5:8

Also do not fear, for the Lord is always with us. We see how the Lord was on Joseph‚Äôs side no matter how bad the situation was. Whatever Joseph did he prospered because the Lord was on his side. It‚Äôs the same with us, the Lord is on our side.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 21- Jenita

Joseph goes through tremendous tribulations.. He is betrayed, backstabbed, sold, falsely accused.. But still through it all.. He is calm because of his trust in the Lord. And that trust is strong because God is always with him.

Similarly, we too need to realize that.. No matter what happens in life... God is with us.. God constantly is walking with us every single second of our lives. And that is the ultimate comfort and assurance of peace one can ever rely on.

#### January 22,2024

##### Go to Joseph

[![Go to Joseph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day022.jpg)](https://youtu.be/N5QPHCYtr_c "Go to Joseph")

##### Day 22: ‚ÄúGo to Joseph‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We read such a beautiful story of Gods providence today. God uses Joseph to provide for his family. Joseph was sold by his brother, falsely accused by his masters wife and eventually thrown in Jail. One would think that it‚Äôs the end of the road for him. But our God can bring streams in the desert vegetation in dry land. He does lift up Joseph by giving him the ability to interpret dreams. Now Joseph becomes the one who saves literally the whole world as there was a famine in the whole world. He literally was the defender of bread during the drought. Isn‚Äôt he similar to St Joseph who also flees to Egypt with Mary and defended the baby Jesus - the bread of life. One of the titles of Joseph is the worker - he worked hard to provide for Jesus - also the OT Joseph is a great worker as he worked for 7 years to collect grain so much grain that they were not able to measure it. Let us learn from these two great men in the Bible and be defenders of Jesus - the bread of life. Let us be defenders of the faith.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè

##### Day 22 Simitra

Genesis 41:16¬† ‚ÄúI myself cannot do it,‚Äù Joseph replied, ‚Äúbut God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.‚Äù

This shows us the humility of Joseph. He does not claim to have the understanding or knowledge about the interpretation of dreams but attributes it all to God.

1 Corinthians 3:17, "So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth".

For all of us especially those in any ministry,¬†proclaiming the Word of God and seeing signs and wonders, we need to be reminded that it is God alone who gives the growth and so in all of it God be glorified.

##### Judah Changes

[![Judah Changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day023.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A7q-74io-qY "Judah Changes")

##### Day 23: ‚ÄúKeep hold of instruction, do not let go‚Äù - Michael Eltham

‚ÄúWalk in the path of the righteous and you will never stumble‚Äù

The proverb we hear today is so true. The only qualification to get to heaven is to be a saint, yes to be a ‚Äúsaint‚Äù. We are not born saints, we are born with original sin and the urge to sin is always with us. We read in Romans 7:14-15

‚ÄúI do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate...‚Äù

However, we should not just give into our own desires, but detest sin and follow Christ. It‚Äôs not just about following rules, it‚Äôs all about loving the Lord (‚Äú If you love me you will keep my commandments‚Äù Jh 14:15) If we love the Lord and try our very best to be holy, He will pour His love into Hearts through the Holy Spirit. He will write His laws on our hearts, and we will follow them out of love, not out of compulsion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 23 - Jenita

everyone and everything changes in time. A broken heart, broken relationship, people, situations, everything changes in time with the grace of God.

Although Judah indulged in inappropriate activities, knowingly or unknowingly, the stains on his reputation are erased in these chapters from Genesis. We see how he is looked at as one who takes responsibility over his family by pledging his life for them.

Situations change.

Similarly although we may feel that this particular incident in our lives has led to a very unfavorable situation, when it is surrendered to God, everything will work in our favour.

He is the God who restores.

##### Tears of Joy

[![Tears of Joy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day024.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7y5ENYg8NWM "Tears of Joy")

##### Day 24: ‚ÄúUnity in the family‚Äù - Michael Eltham

Today‚Äôs readings make for such a beautiful scene. Joseph is united to his family, meets his beloved father (remember Joseph was the fav child), his younger brother who he never met before. He is reconciled with all his brothers who sold him. It‚Äôs the best feeling ever. No wonder he could not hold back tears, he cried like newborn baby. They all wept and hugged and felt complete as one family again. After all the betrayal, separation, anger, jealousy, loss, sadness‚Ä¶ Finally, it‚Äôs time to be happy. Oh! what JOY!!!

Ps 133:1 ‚ÄúBehold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!‚Äù

We choose our friends, but our family is given to us. Some people in the family are harder to love than others. But we should nevertheless pray and seek to live in harmony with everyone. It‚Äôs not easy, with our strength it‚Äôs impossible but with God ‚Äúall things are possible‚Äù. Let us pray for our family, especially those who are difficult to live with.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Up to Day 24 (anonymous)

Joseph! There's so much to love about him!

Did no wrong... was hated anyway.

Gave credit to God for the skill/blessing of being able to understand and explain dreams.

Recognised God's hand & God's providence in his life that led him to where he ended up... in the position of a saviour to those who hurt him.

Forgave those who caused him harm... demonstrated a generous love.

But my favourite thing about him‚Äîhe cried.
I'm so glad that this is even in the Bible!

Men can cry.
Men should cry.
Crying is not a sign of weakness.
Crying has nothing to do with gender.
These are human emotions.
Men are human.
They should feel free to express themselves, and to cry...
in pain,
in fear,
in sorrow,
but even in joy!

May we allow, and even encourage, the boys and men in our lives to be true to themselves, and cry whenever they feel like it.

##### Job's Questioning

[![Job's Questioning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day025.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mdu9C7LOSsc "Job's Questioning")

##### Day 25: ‚ÄúRedemptive Suffering‚Äù - Michael Eltham

As we read through the book of Job we can‚Äôt but sympathize with Job. We see all the suffering that he is going through and feel sad for him. The 3 friends and the young man ‚Äì can‚Äôt understand his suffering. They think he is lying when Job says that he did nothing wrong, because the Old Testament understating was that God prospers the good and the evil are punished with sickness and ruin.

Sometimes we are like the friends of Job, we don‚Äôt understand why there is suffering in the world. When we see people suffering, we tend to judge or reason. When we suffer ourselves, we want to find a quick relief, an easy way out. When we are sick we run to the doctors and try every medicine possible to overcome our sickness. However when we sin we avoid praying or going to confession. We need to be equally eager about our soul and care for it even better than we care for our body.

We can‚Äôt use a ‚ÄúOne size fits all‚Äù when it comes to suffering. Some suffering is due to our sin and some suffering is permitted. It‚Äôs called redemptive suffering.

Redemptive suffering is the Christian belief that human suffering, when accepted and offered up in union with the Passion of Jesus, can remit the just punishment for one's sins or for the sins of another, or for the other physical or spiritual needs of oneself or another.

Let us look at the book of Job with the lens of Jesus‚Äôs suffering on the cross. Job was a just man suffered for no sin of his, so was Jesus ‚Äì who had no sin ‚Äì however - suffered for the sin of every human being.

Along with making prayers for healing and taking good care of our bodies, we also need to offer up every suffering that we go through for the redemption of our soul and the souls of our family, friends and enemies. :)

##### Day 26: ‚ÄúA life well lived‚Äù

We read the life in summary of Job and Joseph. Two men who were ‚Äújust‚Äù. Unlike Joseph‚Äôs broken family, Joseph seems to have been able to live out his entire life well. Even though his brothers did evil to him, he forgave them. After their father‚Äôs death, they had their doubts again, I‚Äôm sure this statement would have set them straight.

‚ÄúYou meant it for evil, but God meant it for good so that many are saved. ‚Äù

Romans 8:28 tells us, ‚Äò‚Ä¶We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.‚Äô

We can rest assured that we will eventually see the favor of the Lord. Even though we may have to go through many trials and sufferings. Our end will be blessed, and our generations to come will be blessed because of our closeness to the Lord.

The stories of both the great men end with how they are blessed on earth. But those stories also mention that they died. Given that they were just men ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure they have now received a great reward in Heaven. May that be our story as well, may we be called just and may all our paths be righteous.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 27: ‚ÄúJesus the new Moses‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We see how the new Egyptian king is afraid of the descendant of Joseph. Because the Lord is with Joseph‚Äôs generation, they were fruitful, prosperous, and multiplying. This freaked out the king.

Out of fear the new king does cowardly things like trying to kill the newborn sons, throwing them into the Nile. Imagine a royal king afraid of babies. Even the little babies of God‚Äôs people are powerful, we need to remember that the world is afraid of those who love God.

Jesus is the new Moses ‚Äì their story has many similarities. The ruler/king is afraid of them. There is a decree to kill the firstborn during both Moses' and Jesus' time. Moses was forced to be sent off in a basket from his own people the Israelites and went to the Egyptians. Joseph and Mary had to flee with baby Jesus from Israel to Egypt. Moses could not stand the unjust burdens put on the people of Israel; Jesus could not stand the insane number of spiritual burdens that the elders of Israel put on the people.

‚ÄúThe well‚Äù ‚Äì We must pay close attention when we read about a "well" in the Bible, as it‚Äôs usually associated with a wedding or wedding proposal. We read how Moses met his bride today at the well today. Also, remember how Abraham sent his servant to look for a wife for his son Isaac and the servant found Rebekah at the well.

Even Jesus found His bride at the well, the Samaritan women. Don‚Äôt be scandalized ‚Äì she just represents humanity. Jesus is our spiritual bridegroom and we, His bride.

##### Day 28: ‚ÄúReverence for God‚Äù - Michael Eltham

One thing that is on the decline in today's world is the reverence for God. We see people cursing and taking the Lord‚Äôs name in vain. We are taking God out of everything - schools, marriages, relationships, laws of the country.

We see Moses‚Äô first exposure to Divinity. He could not look at it and had to cover his face. God told him that he needed to take off his sandals for he was standing on Holy ground.

We need to examine ourselves each time we come into God‚Äôs presence, whether it is personal prayer or Holy Eucharist. We need to examine our hearts and repent of any sin(take off our sandals) before we worship our God.

Receiving communion has become such a casual thing and the sacrament of confession has become a yearly affair. Let us examine our hearts and see if any mortal sins needs to be confessed. For we do not encounter just another person but God himself, the great ‚ÄúI AM‚Äù. He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end ‚Äì there was nothing before Him and nothing comes after Him.

God created us in His image and likeness, but we try to create God in our image and put him in a box ‚Äì we ask Him his name, we ask what God can do, we ask if God can heal us, provide for us, etc. We seem to doubt God's power or will to do good sometimes.

We cannot comprehend God fully; we can just experience a few aspects of God. If God reveals himself fully to us ‚Äì we will not be able to look (like Moses)

Let us have a deeper reverence for the Lord. Take off our sandals of sin as we draw closer to the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè.

##### Day 29: "Finding excuses" - Michael Eltham

Moses had an excuse for everything the Lord asked him to do. Some of his questions

‚Ä¢ ‚Äú God ‚Äì What‚Äôs your name/ Who are you?‚Äù

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIf I go to the Israelites, ‚ÄúWhat if they won‚Äôt believe me? ‚Äù

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not eloquent with words.‚Äù

Even though the Lord showed him two Miracles ‚Äì ‚Äòone with the staff turning into a snake‚Äô and ‚Äòthe healing of leprosy ‚ÄòMoses said ‚Äì ‚Äúsend someone else‚Äù Even though the Great I AM said he would be with Moses ‚Äì Moses made excuses. The scripture says that God was angry.
Ex 4:14 ‚ÄúThen the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses‚Äù
We may have a bunch of excuses, not enough time or not enough resources blah blah blah. Enough of blaming others and making excuses ‚Äì it‚Äôs time to get tough on ourselves. We need to sit down and reflect on the excuses we make when the Lord calls us to do something.
I‚Äôm too old, I‚Äôm too young, "I‚Äôm shy", "I have the wrong background", "If I only was more social", "If I was healthier", "If it wasn‚Äôt for the Virus:"‚Ä¶.‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy‚Äù
Speaking of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too Busy‚Äù. When Pharoah found out that the Israelites wanted to take 3 days off to Worship the Lord, he said they had no work and gave them more work.
Do we have Pharaohs in our lives, or is part of us Pharaoh itself? When our soul yearns for the Lord, we come up with so many chores and tasks ‚Äì that we neglect "dedicated Worship time "for the Lord. Let us stop making excuses and start worshiping the great I AM.

##### Day 30 ‚ÄúHardness of heart‚Äù - Michael Eltham

God had to remind Moses ‚Äì over and over again, who God was. The God of your fathers ‚Äì Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God wants to remind Moses that God is no random person but God almighty, the God who created us.

Isn‚Äôt it the same with us? We have seen so many Miracles and seen how the Lord has provided for us till now, yet we doubt Him and are overly anxious about so many things. Our hearts are so hard.

In Leviticus, we see how flexible God is towards us. For is allowing almost anything to be offered as a sin offering. One is supposed to offer a Ram but if they can‚Äôt afford it, they offer something as simple as flour. God does not want anything to stand in the way of His Mercy towards us.

Like Pharaoh, we are hardening our hearts and don‚Äôt want to listen to God. Even though we see so many Miracles. Or maybe our hearts are full of doubt like Moses and Arron.

‚ÄúToday, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts‚Äù Heb 3:15

May the Holy Spirit melt our stony hard hearts and give us Hearts of Flesh.

##### Day 31: ‚ÄúInstant prayers‚Äù

We are used to getting what we want almost immediately. Drive-through food, ATM - Any time money, Instant money transfer, Instant coffee, Instant Pot, expecting an immediate reply to your text, instant relief, etc.

We even expect God to respond immediately to our prayers, which does happen. However, sometimes God holds back his response/blessing so that we learn our life lessons. We need pain and suffering in our lives ‚Äì for If we were self-sufficient, we would not need others or God. We would be focused on the physical world and not worry about our souls.

Pharoah got tired of the frogs, gnats, and flies ‚Äì he told Moses that he would let God‚Äôs people go if Moses could stop the plagues. When Moses asked when Pharaoh said tomorrow. Pharoah‚Äôs heart was not ready ‚Äì Moses and Arron ‚Äì did the Miracle and stopped the plagues ‚Äì but Pharoah did not keep up his end of the deal, he did not let the people go.

Sometimes when we receive answers to prayers too quickly ‚Äì we are not really learning the lesson that we ought to. So let us not be in a hurry, let us petition the Lord and wait for Him to answer. In the expectant waiting ‚Äì let us learn to love suffering and offer it up for our soul and for everyone else.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us üôè

##### Cattle, Boils, and Hail

##### Day 32: ‚ÄúHabitual sins‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We see Pharoah doing it again. He asks for the plague to be taken away and promises to send God‚Äôs people to worship ‚Äì but when the plague is taken away ‚Äì he goes back to hardening his heart again.

Isn‚Äôt that the case with us and our habitual sins?

The first time is always the hardest time to commit a sin. We need to really fight against our conscience (hopefully a well-formed conscience) and do the bad deed. After committing the sin ‚Äì and the momentary pleasure has passed ‚Äì one feels very sorry for their sin, they possibly make a confession and decide to never commit that sin again.

More often than not, one slips into the same sin again, goes through the process of repentance again.

This sin continues over and over again and becomes what we call a ‚ÄúHabitual sin‚Äù.

The person is in bondage to the sin unless the person truly has ‚Äúmetanoia‚Äù(a change of mind/heart) and allows the Holy Spirit to strengthen them through the sacramental life.

Let us join the Psalmist in this prayer for habitual sin.

Ps 19: 13 ‚ÄúKeep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent of the great transgression.‚Äù

Also, don‚Äôt be discouraged even St Paul prayed three times for the thorn in his flesh to be taken away and was given the answer that

‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù 2 Cor 12:19

May all our bondages to habitual sin be broken in Jesus' name.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè

##### Day 32 - Gabriella

We are so blessed by our heavenly Father to know how merciful and loving He is to each and every soul. I have now gained a clear perspective on Pharaoh‚Äôs behaviour and heart.

I have also often pondered why does God harden Pharaoh‚Äôs heart? He did not take away his free will. In fact God revealed himself to Pharaoh who knew God was above all gods and in spite of this Pharaoh obstinately refuses to acknowledge God. And God shows His goodness, His power but it was Pharaoah who hardened his heart.

*Hebrews 3:7‚Äì8*
Therefore the Holy Spirit says, 'Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in rebellion. . . ‚Äú

##### Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born

[![Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day033.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YqYQ4HePEOE "Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born")

##### Day 33: ‚ÄúIdols and false gods‚Äù

We see the 10 plagues and would wonder why 10; Fr Mike explains it so beautifully about the 10 gods that the Egyptians had and Pharoah would not be content until he saw all those gods defeated. Our God, ‚ÄúGod Almighty‚Äù, ‚Äúthe great I AM - Yahweh‚Äù, ‚Äúthe First and the Last‚Äù, ‚Äúthe source of all good‚Äù destroyed every false Egyptian god with each plague.

God wanted to free His people so that they can go and worship Him.

We have many false gods and idols in our lives. The dictionary meaning for god is ‚Äú(in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity. ‚Äú

Let us examine our hearts to see what is it that has power over us? What is it that controls us?

Could be our sins, incorrect beliefs, things, status, power, or people. Or it could be us creating God in our own image instead of learning who He is and how he wants to be worshiped.

Moses tells Pharaoh that they need to also take the cattle along with them to worship the Lord because Moses does not know how God would want them to offer sacrifice.

Moses was not being sneaky but being honest here.

We need to be honest as we journey through the BIAY and see what unfolds, how does God want us to worship? What does Jesus command us to do? ‚ÄúDo this in memory of me‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Passover Instituted

[![The Passover Instituted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day034.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7sPdLnUkhRE "The Passover Instituted")

##### Day 34: ‚ÄúWho is worthy‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We all are familiar with what went down in the Passover. The explanation today in the podcast is remarkable, so many items to talk about. However, will stick to one. The uncircumcised shall not eat of the lamb.

As described by Justin Martyr in the ~150 AD that the Eucharist was only received by some, even today only the baptized are allowed to receive communion.

Modern beliefs (15th century) of ‚ÄúSaved by Faith alone‚Äù run into hot water when we go deeper in scripture and learn the true meaning, not just what it means in the 21st century, but by understating the traditions and history of the Israelites. Below are some points on why Baptism is considered so important to be saved, to be integrated into the church, and to prepare us to receive the Eucharist.

Unlike the common definition for born again ‚Äì ‚ÄúBelieve in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved‚Äù

Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again, ‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.‚Äù John 3:5

Water & Spirit

We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.

2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again ‚Äì we have the theme of water and Spirit.

3. We see the Israelites crossing the red see(water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.

Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.

4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land

5. Jesus was baptized ‚Äì in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.

6. So you are being saved by BAPTISIM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)

7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)

8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession

9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Crossing the Red Sea

[![Crossing the Red Sea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day035.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ckv9Lc74htE "Crossing the Red Sea")

##### Day 35: ‚ÄúThe Lord is fighting for us‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We see how the Israelites get impatient and start complaining, that they were better off in Egypt.

But God tells us not to give us, not to succumb to the small trials we face. We need to ‚Äúbe still‚Äù, for the Lord is fighting for us. Does that mean we need to do nothing? Or maybe it means we need to stand our ground, keep doing good, resist the enemy and persevere.

Let us not trust in our own ability or strength. We need to just keep moving forward in the direction the Lord is leading us, even though it seems hard and there is no possible solution.

The Lord will make a way where there seems to be no way, He will open up the sea to lead us a dry path. Just keep doing what He commands you to do, our perseverance will be rewarded with a "breakthrough".

The Lord will crush the enemy that pursues us, that comes after us. The Lord will wipe them out from the face of the earth, like Pharoah and his chariots ‚Äì there will be none left.

‚ÄúIf God is for us, who can be against us?‚Äù Rom 8:31

‚ÄúSome trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.‚Äù Ps 20:7

Jer 20:11 ‚Äú‚Äù

But the Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. ‚Äú

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 35 Anonymous

Joseph's bones were carried out of Egypt as told by him. This is an eye-opener to me, as I wondered why remains are preserved even today.
GOD has revealed Himself in humility, poverty, allowed us to torture Hiim.
The Lord fights for you, you have to only keep still.

##### Manna From Heaven

[![Manna From Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day036.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1WTXCYU6f7U "Manna From Heaven")

##### Day 36: ‚ÄúMurmuring for Manna to Murmuring about the True presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.‚Äù - Michael Eltham

A few weeks after the great Miracle of the Red Sea parting, the Israelites start their murmuring.

They look back at the days of their slavery and say it would have been better for us to have died in the land of Egypt, at least we had enough to eat. God rains Manna from heaven, the bread that came down from heaven. This bread that they ate sustained them for the journey to the promised land.

This was just a prefiguration of what we have today in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the bread of life, the bread that came down from Heaven. Jesus was born in Bethlehem - which means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù.

Jesus offers us His body in the Eucharist, our daily Manna. The food that will sustain us on our journey to the promised land ‚Äì Heaven.

Jesus referred to this incident in John 6

‚ÄúI am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.‚Äù

Most people started ‚Äúmurmuring‚Äù after this teaching ‚Äì about eating his flesh. They said this teaching was too difficult and they stopped following Jesus. If the bread he offered was just symbolic and not real flesh, they would have not left, Jesus meant His flesh. We will deep dive into this when we get to John.

Are we murmuring about the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist? The Eucharist is truly Jesus‚Äô Body and Blood, the food that will sustain us on our journey to Heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 36 Simitra

Exodus 16:17-18, "And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat".

Irrespective of the quantity they collected, those who collected much did not have left over and those who collected less were not in lack.

This is so profound. If only we can look at this and know that no matter how much we accumulate it will never be sufficient for our greed however those who are in poverty are living their lives relying on God to give them their fill each day and so are filled.

So let us live to worship God. We are given six days to work and keep one day -the Sabbath Holy as it is the day that we are to praise and worship God for his goodness. One day to praise and thank God, so that we remember that we have His grace with us on the six days that we work.

##### Day 36 Anonymous

God is training them. Trying to teach His people who He is and the degree to which they can trust Him. He is faithful. We have to be obedient to Him, His commandments. He told the people of Israel not to keep food He gave them for the next day. Yet some disobeyed and kept, but next day it was spoilt. God shows how truthful He is. But when God commanded them to gather on the sixth day for 2 days as it was Sabbath, Holy to The Lord, the food never spoilt. Such is the Power of God Almighty. What He says He does.
All Glory to HIM!

[![The Mystical Works of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day037.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E1KpvQIdeco "The Mystical Works of God")

##### Day 37: ‚ÄúWater from the Rock - Jesus‚Äù - Michael Eltham

Before we get into the water from the rock, there is a moving image of the power of intercessory prayer. We see when Moses held up his hands the Israelites prevailed and when he put his hand down the Amaleks prevailed. When his hands grew weary Arron and Hur helped lift them up.

The life lesson to learn here is ‚Äì when we encounter difficult situations and big problems(war) we need to lift up our arms in prayer (Be still for the Lord is fighting for us ‚Äì we ought to keep praying and stand our ground) and when we get weary of praying we need our family, friends and community to support us in prayer.

‚ÄúIsraelites the fault finders‚Äù sounds a little harsh when we call them out like this, but aren‚Äôt we being fault finders when we call out their fault. Let‚Äôs put ourselves in their shoes and we would possibly do the same if we were without water. We would probably say ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt God with us?‚Äù

The Lord command Moses to strike the rock with his rod and water flowed out. This quenched their thirst.

Jesus the new Moses is the rock Himself, the rock of ages, the stone that the builders rejected.

When the soldiers pierced His side, blood and water poured out. The living water ‚Äì the Holy Spirit ‚Äì the water that Jesus spoke about at the well to the Samaritan women.

‚ÄúEveryone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.‚Äù Jh 4:13

Jesus fulfils this promise on Pentecost, He send the Holy Spirit the Living waters to become within us a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.

##### The Ten Commandments

[![The Ten Commandments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day038.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vAZYQXQl-zI "The Ten Commandments")

##### Day 38 ‚ÄúRelationship and Rules‚Äù - Michael Eltham

No relationship will flourish without rules. There is no sport without rules, no school without school rules, imagine driving on a road without any traffic rules, would you put your money in a bank with no rules and anyone could withdraw your money. Rules are for the common good of all.

When you buy any product, it will always come with a manual to use the product. No one will put stainless steel containers in a microwave or fill water in a car gas tank. Without knowing we are following rules in the world, what if you decide to not believe in the law of gravity and decide to walk off a skyscraper. Foolishness. :)

God gave us commandments not to burden us or to make us miserable. But to give us a guideline to live the good life. Just imagine if everyone followed the commandments, if everyone had a right relationship with God, honored their parents, did not steal, kill, or commit adultery. It would have been heaven on earth. Being human we tend to dabble with sin, we look for momentary satisfaction and a shortcut (For example: eating the forbidden fruit to become like God)

Sin causes shame, like Adam and Eve we want to hide from God. We lose our right relationship with God which leaves us empty. We try to fill this emptiness with more temporary satisfaction by committing more sin. We will never rest until we rest in God.

Let us rise up and go to the Father who is waiting for us. Try again to follow His commandments so that it will be good with us and we are in the right state with God, we will walk with Him fearlessly in the Garden in the cool of the evening.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Slavery in the Old Testament

[![Slavery in the Old Testament](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day039.jpg)](https://youtu.be/otX2IGrq7wI "Slavery in the Old Testament")

##### Day 39 ‚ÄúGod delivered Israelites from slavery, now He will slowly remove slavery from their hearts‚Äù - Michael Eltham

Like Fr Mike explained so beautifully, God must deal gently with us broken human beings. If we take the reading out of context, we can tend to say that God likes slavery and hence made rules for the slaves. If God does not stoop down to our level, we will not be able to bare God, just like when God spoke to his people on mount Sanai a few chapters ago it was like thunder and the people requested Moses that God not speak to them, rather Moses be the listener.

A nocturnal creature like a rodent ‚Äì would flee to hide when there is a bright light turned ON. In the same way, if God reveals Himself to us directly, we will die of awe. We will be blinded like Saul(St Paul) we will be consumed by His fire of Love. God is dealing gently with the Israelites who were slaves for generations (400 years), slavery is a way of life for them. It‚Äôs just like bringing an abused pet home, we need to first let the pet know that we are not going to hurt it. We need to give it space, and offer it some calm, some care, although we want to go and hug it and tell it that we mean no harm, the pet is not in a state to understand care and love ‚Äì it will bite us if we approach it with too much of enthusiasm. It took God little time to get the Israelites out of slavery (Egypt) but will take many years to get slavery (Egypt) out of their hearts. Let us journey with them, as the Lord journeys with us to lead us slowly and gently to wholeness as He leads the Israelites to the promised land both physically and mentally.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 40: ‚ÄúOnly Mortal sin makes us unworthy of receiving communion, not just bodily discharge‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We are invited to the great banquet, the lamb‚Äôs supper ‚Äì we receive Jesus‚Äô body and blood. To respond to this invitation, we must prepare ourselves for so great and so holy a moment.

St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself."218 Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion. CC 1385

The reason I bring it up is for us not to get too worried about instructions in Leviticus about becoming unclean from bodily discharge. Remember these instructions are Baby steps that will evolve into solid teaching by the time Jesus comes.

The only thing that makes us unworthy of receiving communion is Mortal sin. If the bodily discharge is due to a mortal sin then you are unworthy due to the mortal sin, not the bodily discharge alone.

‚ÄúBut what comes out of the man, that is what defiles him.
From within the man, from his heart,
come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,
adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.
All these evils come from within and they defile.‚ÄùMk 7:21-23

Jesus is making it very clear that we should not pay too much attention to outward things but focus on the heart, for from the heart comes sin and it is sin that defiles us.

Congratulations on making it to day 40, the number 40 means a long time in the bible. Kudos to us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

##### Day 41: ‚ÄúAtonement for sins ‚Äì Confession & Eucharist‚Äù

Instructions given for atonement of sins are so detailed and clear, two lambs were needed ‚Äì one for the priests and one for the people, placing the sins on the lamb and sacrificing one and sending the other one out to the wilderness to die.

Jesus is the spotless lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. He does not need two lambs as He was the priest himself, a priest in the order of Melchizedek, He had no sins and only had to carry the sins of the people.

‚Äú Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. ‚Äú Heb 7:27

We need not offer lambs, goats, or bulls anymore as Jesus paid for our sins once and for all. However, we are invited to celebrate the Lamb's supper everyday ‚ÄúDo this in memory of me‚Äù.

We are invited to the ‚ÄúAtonement of sins‚Äù and the sacrifice literally every day at Mass and mandatory once a week on Sunday.

We need to prepare for Mass by checking our hearts for any unconfessed sins.

We need to pray with the Psalmist and examine our conscience

Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts. See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Ps 139:23-24

If our sins are Venial then a Confession is not Mandatory as the truly repented "Venial" sins are forgiven at Mass, but if it‚Äôs a Mortal sin we need to make a confession to be made worthy to receive communion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Moral Laws

[![Moral Laws](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day042.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IdnEHXWyjaI "Moral Laws")

##### Day 42: ‚ÄúMoral Law‚Äù - Michael Eltham

As we hear the laws and detailed instructions, we can‚Äôt help but realize how privileged we are, we don‚Äôt live in barbarous times. We live in Nations that have laws and regulations. We also have something called the natural and moral law. We have manners and acceptable social behavior. Let‚Äôs thank the Lord for He is the source of all good.

James 1:17 ‚Äú Everything good comes from God‚Äù.

CCC 1961 God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself to be his people and revealed his Law to them, thus preparing for the coming of Christ. The Law of Moses expresses many truths naturally accessible to reason. These are stated and authenticated within the covenant of salvation.

Many of these laws are still relevant today and that‚Äôs why marriage is not permitted for those closely related, the human race has come a long way.

However, we notice that the sexual immorality that was happening back then is still happening in our sociality today. Instead of correcting the bad behavior, society praises them and the government law permits it.

We need to heed the warning of the Lord lest our nations will be destroyed.

Lev 18: 22-24

‚ÄúMen, you must not have sexual relations with another man as with a woman. That is a terrible sin!

‚ÄúMen, you must not have sexual relations with any animal. This will make you filthy. And women, you must not have sexual relations with any animal. It is against nature!

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make yourself unclean by doing any of these wrong things! I am throwing nations off their land and giving it to you because they did those terrible sins.

They made the land filthy. Now the land is sick of those things, and it will vomit out the people who live there.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 43: ‚ÄúThe Tabernacle, His presence‚Äù - Michael Eltham

We could get lost in the details as we read today's reading about the ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù of the Tabernacle. Whenever I see a lot of detail documented the stance I take is that the thing is of great importance. The more the details the greater the importance. ‚ÄúIf we have no plan we are planning to fail‚Äù A few things that struck home when I was hearing the readings was the close similarity of the worship in the Catholic Church thousands of years later. The concept of the bread of the presence ‚Äì where bread is always present with a lampstand near it, every catholic church has one and this makes the church holy.

The Old Testament bread was just bread offered up to the Lord, but our NT bread is the consecrated body of Jesus, the true flesh of Jesus. (John 6) This is not just biblical but also proven by countless Eucharistic Miracles that have taken place down the centuries. Many of the Miracles have been scientifically evaluated and found to be supernatural ‚Äì Like when the bleeding host was evaluated ‚Äì it turned out to be the heart tissue of a middle-aged man in distress. So many other similarities like the Holy of Holies ‚Äì the general area and the altar of the church. The table of offering the cherubim and the mercy seat etc. One thing to call out is Catholics do not worship any of the images or statues ‚Äì they are just visuals for us to worship God, we do worship Jesus who is present in the Tabernacle and that‚Äôs why we bow down.

And let us not forget that the mercy seat was built on top of the ark of the covenant ‚Äì just to remind us that God‚Äôs mercy is above the law. He loves us first and has mercy towards us, the law is something we need to follow to be better lovers of God and Neighbour. But His Mercy exceeds the law. We are saved by His Mercy and not by following the law.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

##### Day 43 Simitra

Exodus 25:30
And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before me always.

The bread of the presence was placed in the Holy Place for which there was no direct access to the people of Israel.

However today Jesus the bread of Life is not only placed in the Tabernacle daily but is also willingly entering into our hearts. How blessed we are as Roman Catholics to receive the presence of God through the Holy Eucharist DAILY. Thank you Jesus for nourishing us with your body, the bread of life daily.

##### Priestly Garments

##### Day 44: ‚ÄúPriests' clothes during Worship aren‚Äôt Jeans and T-shirt‚Äù - Michael Eltham

The detailed description of the vestments in today's reading can get to you. Hope this pictures, I found on the internet will help.

In our modern day and age we see fashion and style becoming increasingly immodest. This has crept into the church, we see a few Church goers, may be even some ‚ÄúChoir members‚Äù or lectors not wear appropriate attire. We also see that in some non-Catholic demonization, there is an over emphasis on how the Stage looks ‚Äì lights -sound, rock start pastors, pastors preaching in Jeans/shorts/t-shirts or overly fancy suits. All that is okay for a Christian concert or a social event. It‚Äôs important to give our best to God, however we need to follow His instructions when it comes to true Worship. When we attend Mass, we are celebrating the grand wedding feast of the Lamb ‚Äì we are His bride and He is our bridegroom. We need to be modest and dressed well to honor Him.

The Priest is persona Christi ‚Äì represents Christ. The Vestments ‚Äì are meant to obscure the individuality of the priest and to draw attention to Christ. He is no longer black, white or brown or young, old, weak, strong -he loses his identity ‚Äì Like John the Baptist said ‚ÄúHe must increase and I Must decrease‚Äù

The priest like in the OT had 12 stones on his breastplate to represent the 12 tribes of Israel. He carried God‚Äôs people in His heart when we offered the sacrifice. Even our priest carry the people in their heart when they offer the sacrifice of the Mass. Each part of the Bishop's vestment means something worth learning about.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### Day 45: ‚ÄúHoly Priests and celibacy‚Äù

When major clergy scandals come up, we can very easily blame the priests and the bishops. However, we need to remember that priests come from families and from the community. There is a lot of sin and corruption in this world that has influenced everyone laity and priests alike. We need to pray and support our brother priests to lead a holy life. And we need to also bring to justice those who have violated the innocence of others.

The catholic priests are called to imitate Jesus at a higher level, hence are also called to celibacy.

Below is an excerpt from ‚ÄúCatholic Answers ‚Äù

In examining the issue of celibacy, we should first address its historical development in the life of the Church and then its spiritual basis and relevance for today‚Äôs clergy.

Our Lord presented celibacy as a legitimate lifestyle not only by His very life since He never married but also in His teaching. When our Lord emphasized that marriage was a covenant between husband and wife and thereby prohibited divorce and re-marriage (cf. Matthew 19:3-12), He concluded, ‚ÄúSome men are incapable of sexual activity from birth; some have been deliberately made so; and some there are who have freely renounced sex for the sake of God‚Äôs reign.‚Äù Traditionally, our Church‚Äì as evidenced in the Catechism (#1579)‚Äì points to this ‚Äúfree renunciation of sex for the sake of God‚Äôs reign‚Äù as a basis for celibacy.

Nevertheless, in the early Church, clerical celibacy was not mandated. St. Paul in his first letter to St. Timothy wrote, ‚ÄúA bishop must be irreproachable, married only once, of even temper, self-controlled, modest, and hospitable‚Äù (3:2) and ‚ÄúDeacons may be married but once and must be good managers of their children and their households‚Äù (3:12). However, one should not erroneously construe this teaching to mean that a bishop, priest, or deacon had to be married; St. Paul admitted that he himself was not married (I Corinthians 7:8).

Let us pray for our priest today.

##### Set Apart for God

[![Set Apart for God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day046.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UYClL-9IDGo "Set Apart for God")

##### Day 46: ‚ÄúHoly Oil, Holy water, Holy stuff, Sacramentals‚Äù

It‚Äôs fascinating to see how many of the practices in the catholic church stem from OT instructions from the Lord. The sabbath law, the consecrating of cups, temples, altars, and priests.

We see that priests were anointed with oil. One thing to call out is there is no intrinsic power in the oil or the oil on its own has no power - it‚Äôs the method God prescribes.

Just as we dedicate different bowls for different purposes, the bowls used to feed the dogs won‚Äôt be used to feed the kids.

When something is blessed ‚Äì all we do is mark it for special use, for a supernatural purpose.

That‚Äôs why the priests are anointed and set apart to do God‚Äôs work.

Even oils, water, salt, medals, prayer cloths, bibles, pictures, and statues are used, once blessed are called ‚Äúsacramentals‚Äù They are used for sacramental purposes and for personal prayer use.

The blessed items are holy and will help remind us to pray and even ward off evil. It can be used when praying prayers of healing or deliverance. Many miracles have taken place with the use of sacramentals.

One of the Biblical references for sacramentals can be seen in acts, where handkerchiefs from Paul healed sick people.

Acts 29: 11, 12 ‚ÄúGod did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.‚Äù

##### The Golden Calf

[![The Golden Calf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day047.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rCAaZjEWy34 "The Golden Calf")

##### Day 47: ‚ÄúMan-O-Man what a man - Moses‚Äù ‚ÄúWe the stiff-necked people want to make God in our own image‚Äù ‚ÄúBe a Levite ‚Äì on the Lord‚Äôs Side‚Äù

There is a lot going on in this one Chapter on the Golden calf. Moses goes up for a time of awesome experience with God, receives tablets that were written by God‚Äôs own finger.

The people waiting for Moses go impatient and uncertain, remember God performed great Miracles for these people ‚Äì brought them out of Egypt by making a dry path in the red sea, manna from heaven, water from the rock, quails from the sky, etc. Yet they get impatient they go to Aaron for a solution.

Aaron does the unthinkable ‚Äì he takes all the gold and makes a calf. Are we not like Aaron and the Israelites, we go impatient and want to take things into our own hands. Isn‚Äôt this Pandemic making us a little impatient and we just want to take things into our own hands.

In general, we tend to take what is good and make it the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù. We take the good things of this world like science, riches, medicine, technology, learning, job, spouses, children, earthly leaders and make little gods out of them, rather than using the things of this world we start misusing them, and then we eventually become salves of these false gods of power, fame, status, fitness, looks, beauty, health. We are a stiff-necked people who want to even take control of God, we want to make of HIM an idol, put him on the shelf when we don‚Äôt want Him, bring Him out when we need Him.

On one side we see the evil stiff-necked people and on the other side, we see this Holy Man Moses.

He puts himself on the line - Interceding for the people he prays ‚ÄúLord blot out my name ‚Äì but please forgive them‚Äù. Just how Abraham pleaded for Sodom and Gomorrah and Moses for the idolaters ‚Äì You and Me are called to be Intercessorsfor this broken and sinful world.

We are called to be Levites, the tribe that ordained themselves by standing up for the Lord. When Moses cried out ‚ÄúWho is on the Lord's side‚Äù the Levites took up sword and slay 3000 Men.

We need to be defenders of the faith in this world, we need to take a stand against all evil. Please don‚Äôt take up swords and start slaying people, but take up the Word of God, the double edge sword, learn it, and use it to slay the evil forces, evil thoughts, and evil theory in this world.

We need to proclaim the Word of God and give every soul an opportunity to be saved.

##### God's Presence

[![God's Presence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day048.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-LqhdCd_rjo "God's Presence")

##### Day 48: ‚ÄúPersonal relationship with God‚Äù ‚ÄúEucharistic Adoration - Our tent of the presence‚Äù

We see this beautiful relationship that Moses had with God. He goes up into the Tent of the Presence regularly and spends time with God. When he came out his face was transformed glowing and radiant. Although he did not see God‚Äôs face (no one can live after seeing God's face) when Moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the Lord would speak with Moses. Even though Moses wanted to see God in all His glory the Lord spared Moses and told him that no one could live if they saw God in all His glory. He did see God's back.

Let us not feel jealous of Moses, we have our own tent of meeting in the Eucharistic Lord. When we go to Eucharistic Adoration, we see God‚Äôs face in the host. It is truly God‚Äôs face because He said ‚ÄúThis is my body‚Äù. The only reason we don‚Äôt see Jesus in all His splendor and glory is for our sake. If we see God‚Äôs glory fully revealed we will not be able to live. Although the effect is the same, if you look at people who frequent Eucharistic adoration, their faces will be glowing. Look at pictures of many saints their faces seem aglow, and they have a hallow as well. All saints love adoration, Mother Theresa would frequent adoration before and after her busy day ‚Äì this gave her the strength needed to serve the poor and the ability to see Jesus in each person she met.

To be able to live this life of vows, these four vows, we need our life to be woven with the Eucharist. That‚Äôs why we begin our day with Jesus in the Holy Eucharist. With him, we go forward. And when we come back in the evening we have one hour of adoration before Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and at this you will be surprised, that we have not had to cut down our work for the poor.

-Saint Mother Theresa.

Here in the adoration, we can like Moses ask for anything and it will be given to us.

If it‚Äôs not for God's presence, we cannot move forward. Like Moses we need to tell the Lord unless you come with us we will not go anywhere. I'm sure the Lord will grant us this request.

##### Day 49: ‚ÄúA willing and cheerful giver‚Äù

As we read the blueprint that God gives the Israelites, the details are so many. If I was given these instructions, I would say let‚Äôs just make a square box for the tablets and get done with it. I would think why all this fuss about the hooks, the poles, the mercy seat, the curtains, the jewelry, the altars, the utensils, the lamps.
But the Israelites responded with great willingness, they came everyone whose heart stirred him, everyone whose spirit moved him, men and women, with different skills weaving, constructing, etc. The people started looking for stuff in their houses, they brought jewelry, fine cloth, anything of value, they brought stuff every day.
‚ÄúThe people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the Lord has commanded us to do. So the people were restrained from bringing; for the stuff they had was sufficient to all the work and more‚Äù Ex 35:5,7
There is something for us to learn from the Israelites, we need to cultivate this attitude towards God‚Äôs work. We should go out of our way to give towards the Gospel, give of our time, our talent, and our resources. We should be willing and our hearts should be stirring to do God‚Äôs work and to love our neighbor.
‚ÄúGod loves a cheerful giver.‚Äù 2 Cor 9:7

##### Day 50 ‚ÄúObedience‚Äù - Michael Eltham

In Leviticus 26 we see detailed explanations on what happens to those who are obedient and those who disobey.
The promise of the Lord for the obedient are many, the most important is ‚ÄúI will walk with you, I will be your God‚Äù. I think this is important as we recall the story of creation, where God walked with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening. It‚Äôs reminding me of that story where a prince of a kingdom wanted to give gifts to a few dedicated people, others picked land and gold but one maiden picked the prince himself. She said, ‚ÄúIf I have the prince, I have everything else‚Äù. That is the best choice that we need to make as well.
We also see the detail of wrath, looks like those who disobey the Lord, get more and more punishment. Like a good Father, God does not want to punish us but cause us to choose him over things of the world, we need to be obedient to be restored to what our first parents lost. If we are obedient the promise is great, ‚ÄúI will walk with you, I am you, God‚Äù. We will walk with the Lord in the cool of the evening. We will experience His presence in our daily lives.

##### Day 51 ‚ÄúGetting worship of God right‚Äù "Votive offerings"

Some would argue that God is Omnipresent, and we can worship Him anywhere, there is no need for a structure. Yes, we can worship God anywhere, there is no harm in that. But if we have been paying close attention, we see detailed instructions about the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, the screens, the lampstand, and most important the consecration of the place to be dedicated for the worship of the most High God.
Of course, the Lord is present when you read your bible at home, He is present when you sing praise songs while driving, He is present in your family prayer and person prayer. However, He calls us to go to Church, the place dedicated to His worship, community worship. We see in the reading how the cloud of smoke engulfed the tabernacle, the presence of the Lord was so strong that the Levites could not even go in. We need to be sensitive to the presence of God when we go to church, bow down and adore Him in the tabernacle. And as we will read later ‚Äì how Jesus will teach us "how to worship", and we will read how the apostles were dedicated to the breaking of bread and if we like we can go deeper and learn how the early Christians and the church fathers worshiped God (not part of the Bible, but can be found in early historic records and writings) it‚Äôs amazing how the Eucharist is the fulfillment of the earlier sacrifices and the one method of worship that was instituted by Jesus and practice and preserved through the generations in its original state. We will learn more as we read through the BIAY. But for now, let us remember that we need to Get worship right, not how we want to, but how God prescribes it.
Votive Offering ‚Äì Many people were so moved by the Lord that they wanted to give more than what is asked. That‚Äôs why we see the value of work(wages) of different people men, women of diff ages had a different Shekel value. It was for those who could not offer sacrifice because there were not Levites, yet wanted to offer more than what was asked of them. Hence they gave their value of wages in the votive offering.
We need to ask ourselves ‚Äì what is my votive offering. Am I just doing the minimum required or am I moved by the Lord to do more than I am asked?
How about going beyond the Sunday obligation and going to church on a few weekdays.
If we have an attitude of ‚ÄúIf I wake up I‚Äôll go‚Äù we need to change it and be more precise like the Levites, measure out what we can do and what we want to do for the Lord, dedicated it to the Lord and He will make sure all hurdles are removed for us to do what we intend to do.
Congratulations on completing Exodus and Leviticus!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 52 ‚ÄúNames, names, names ‚Äì God was serious when he said I have called you by name‚Äù - Michael Eltham

As we hear the names and the numbers we tend to tune out, it‚Äôs totally normal for us. Our capacity as human beings is limited, we can only care for ourselves, our family, and our friends.
However the Lord cares for everyone, he loves each one of us so intimately that
‚ÄúHe knows when we sit down and when we raise up, when we go out and when we come in. Even before a word is on our lips He already knows it.‚Äù Ps 139.
‚ÄúEven your very hair is numbered: ‚Äì Mat 10
He chose us
‚ÄúYou did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you‚Äù John 15
‚ÄúBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.‚Äù Jer 1:5
This knowledge is too much for us to understand, that our creator can love each one in such a personal way. We cannot even imagine how the Lord can love billions and billions and zillions of people across centuries. That he can care about every little thing about each person that ever existed. Even the most complex network of computer servers cannot come close to the knowledge of God. We are truly blessed to be God's chosen children.
My favorite part of today‚Äôs psalm - 84:
Better is one day in your courts
than a thousand elsewhere;
I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
I have never come out of prayer sad or hopeless. Every time we pray ‚Äì we encounter God and no one leaves the presence of God sad and hopeless.
‚ÄúPrayer is the best weapon we possess. It is the key that opens the heart of God.‚Äù

##### Day 53 ‚ÄúFollowing the guidance of the Lord‚Äù - Michael  Eltham

We see how the Lord gives them detailed instruction on how to deal with the different cities/tribes that they come across. He said that he should not fight some people (Esau‚Äôs descendants) but buy food and water from them, and then fight with those who do not let them pass. God has a plan for them, he knows the future and will guide them according to His path.

In the same way, the Lord has plans for us.

Jer 29:11 ‚ÄúFor I know the plans I have for you,‚Äù declares the LORD, ‚Äúplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.‚Äù

We need to lean on the Lord in prayer to hear His heart and to learn what He wants of us.

‚ÄúTrust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.‚Äù Prov 3:5-6

We can find God‚Äôs heart as we read His word. His word will guide us on the right path.

‚ÄúYour word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.‚Äù Ps 119:105

And always remember just as the tribe of Judah always marched first. Our praise should also go up first. Judah means praise.

May this Psalm be our song, may praise always be on our lips.

his praise shall continually be in my mouth.‚Äù

##### Day 54: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take your faith for granted, work out your salvation‚Äù

One statement that Fr Mike made really stood out. ‚ÄúAll priests have to be Levites, but not all Levites are priests.‚Äù

We see that two Levite priests offer unholy fire and die. We also see Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt inherit heaven just because we are baptized/Christians/Priests ‚Äù

In our own faith life, one tends to focus only on the promises that the Lord makes, rely only on God‚Äôs mercy, and do nothing. This is the wrong formula.

The correct formula is to strive hard to be holy and get rid of sin from our lives, we will not succeed if we only go with ‚Äúwill power‚Äù, we need to be led by the Holy Spirit's power (Holy Spirit is our helper) in partnership with the Holy Spirit we can strive to be holy, as holy as we can be. However, after trying really hard all our lives, we need to rely not on our own righteousness but rely fully on Jesus saving Mercy and grace.

We as Christians just cannot continue to live in sin and assume everything is okay, that we will be saved.

‚ÄúWhat then are we to say? Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound? 2 By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it? 3 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.‚Äù Rom 6:15

We need to work out our salvation in partnership with God.

‚Äú work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. ‚Äú 2 Phil 12

St Paul sets a good example ‚Äì he tried really hard all his live and was able to say

‚ÄúI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.‚Äù 2 Tim 4:7

##### Obedience to God

##### Day 55 ‚ÄúTeach my words to your children‚Äù

The statutes, ordinances, commands, commandments, and law of the Lord are good for us. They are the best, no other law is as good as the law of the Lord. Some states have laws that forbid the sale of cigarettes or alcohol to anyone under the age of 21, however, the same state allows teens to have abortions (commit murder).
‚ÄúWhat other great nation has statutes and ordinances as just as this entire law that I am setting before you today?‚Äù Deuteronomy 4:5
We need to remember his Law and his Word and teach it to our children and their children.
‚ÄúAssemble the people for me, and I will let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me as long as they live on the earth, and may teach their children ‚Äú Deuteronomy 4:5
We are responsible for tomorrow's generation. Let us teach and kids and grandkids about God and His word.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

##### Day 55 Anonymous

One Psalm, Ps 88 ends in darkness.

Here is how you are going to carry the Sacred Objects, not to touch them, but carry with poles. Only tribes of Aaron could approach The Tabernacle.
Other families had a different task.
Lord, You have created me for a definite task because of that I can lift up my head. Your life matters.
Thank You Lord!

##### Jealous Husbands

[![Jealous Husbands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day056.jpg)](https://youtu.be/oZsJMk7lmh8 "Jealous Husbands")

##### Day 56 Jealousy between Spouses

We live in a society where there is a lot of cheating, betrayal, infidelity, and divorce. The main reason is that spouses are trying to make a marriage work on their own. We have two human beings ‚Äì who are both broken, trying to find fulfillment in each other.

We as human beings are earthen vessels, when two earthen vessels are in close contact with each other ‚Äì they are bound to bang into each other and cause cracks. The cracks do not help in holding water ‚Äì love. If the cracks are not patched properly, they can escalate into jealousy, betrayal, anger, frustration, ignoring the needs of the spouse, lies, controlling the spouse, Criticism, Contempt, Defensiveness, Stonewalling, infidelity, and eventually separation.

We see the blame game happening with the very first couple Adam and Eve, where Eve offers Adam the forbidden fruit(kind of telling him that she committed the sin so it‚Äôs okay) and we see Adam ‚Äì blaming Eve, ‚ÄúLord the woman you gave me‚Äù, Adam even blaming God.

Who can save us from this??

It takes 3 to make marriage work, Husband, Wife, and God. Modeled like the Holy Trinity ‚Äì Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We need God in every marriage, in fact, God should be what unites a Man and Woman, just as the Holy Spirit is the love between the Father and the Son. If God is honored in the marriage, the marriage will work. To honor God the couple needs to pray together, honor God in life choices and rely on God to make the marriage work. What seems impossible with man is possible with God. Don‚Äôt worry we have Mother Mary looking out for us, she will intercede on our behalf to her Son, as soon as she sees the wine run out in our marriage.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 57 *‚ÄúLent ‚Äì The Nazirite vow ‚Äì time set apart for the Lord‚Äù ‚ÄúPsalm 91 ‚Äì WOW!!!‚Äù*

We read about the Nazirite vow and how one would dedicate a certain time totally to God. They would not have any wine or strong drink; they would let the hair grow and not tend to their grooming needs. Isn‚Äôt this what one does when they decide to give up something for Lent.
We are dedicating ourselves to prayer, reading the bible, attending mass, fasting and almsgiving.
Every Lent is a special time of grace for me, I feel spiritually renewed through the 40 days of prayer, fasting and almsgiving.
We dedicate ourselves to the Lord at the start of Lent when we put ashes on our forehead, reminding us of our nothingness. We need to offer up sacrifices and give up certain things to remind us that we are in lent. Some examples: I plan to give us meat and wine and the kids plan to give up candy for lent. Some people fast a meal and some don‚Äôt add sugar to their coffee. All of these are great reminders to the real purpose of Lent. The real purpose is to remind us what we read in the reading in Deut6 ‚Äì the great Shema ‚Äì ‚Äú Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our God, the LORD alone. You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might‚Äù
Throughout lent we need to refocus on the Lord everyday. Our focus should not be on what we give up or our fasting or almsgiving. The focus should be on the Lord. Making Him the Lord of our life, we should strive to love up with everything we have with our heart, mind and soul with all our might.
Let‚Äôs not forget that every step we take towards God he takes 10 steps towards us. Like we read in Psalm 91 today First verse is what we should need to do and the remaining verses tell us what the Lord will do.
We need to make Him our God and live in Him.

‚ÄúYou who live in the shelter of the Most High,
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty‚Äù

Once we make him our God the blessing will flow:

He will be our fortress
He will deliver us
He will cover us under His wings
His faithfulness will be our shield
We will not fear the terror of night
Nor fear the arrow
Or fear the pestilence
Nor fear destruction
1000 may fall 10000 may fall ‚Äì nothing will befall us
No evil shall befall you
No scourge will come near your home
Angles will guard us in all our ways
We will trample the lion and the serpent
He will deliver us, protect us
He will hear us when we call
He will be with us in trouble
He will rescue us and honor us
With long life He will satisfy us
He will show us salvation

Wow!! Wow!!! Thank you Lord
Ready Ps 91 everyday ‚Äì make Him the Lord and He will take care of us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### Day 57 : Jenita

Today's readings speaks volumes of God's blessings and protection for the people who are faithful to him.

Simple acts of love shown to God leads us to receive innumerable blessings from God.

Trust in God and stay loyal to worshipping and praising God always

##### Day 57 Anonymous

Lord, help us never forget what You have done for us!

Aaronic Blessing - every Parent ought to give this blessing to their children.

We need to remind our children about how The Lord our God brought us out from slavery in Egypt. So we have to obey God's commandments, especially not to defile ourselves, but honour n worship The One True God.

One new revelation about the Sign of The Cross on our forehead, our lips n our heart. - before The Gospel..
"May The Word of The Lord be on our minds, our lips and our hearts.

All Glory to Jesus!

##### A Chosen People

[![A Chosen People](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day058.jpg)](https://youtu.be/y6fknWuyLQU "A Chosen People")

##### Day 58: ‚ÄúDo not have strong ties with the world‚Äù -Michael Eltham

As we journeyed with the Israelites we noticed that the nations that the Lord handed over to the Israelites were much stronger and greater than the Israelites. The Lord with a ‚ÄúMighty hand and outstretched arm‚Äù won every battle for the Israelites.

We see that the Lord commanded the Israelites through Moses not to have mercy on the lands they conquered, to break all the altars of strange gods, not to intermarry with the pagans or make covenants with the other nations. The Lord commanded that they take no gold or silver from those nations.

One possible reason could be that the Lord knows their hearts and their past. They were a people who were born into slavery in Egypt and who possibly practiced local rituals and customs of the Egyptians. They were a people who previously made an idol of gold ‚Äì Baal. The Lord is being very clear here and telling them that they are ‚ÄúA Chosen people, a people set apart‚Äù Not because of what they did but because of God‚Äôs picking, because of the covenant God made with their ancestors(Abraham, Isaac, Jacob). God wanted to preserve them and keep them holy, set them apart for the Lord. Because God will eventually bring Salivation to the whole world through them ‚Äì Jesus would be from the Israelites. Jesus will open salvation to the entire humanity.

We can take a lesson from their journey; we can try not to have strong ties to the world and worldly people.

Jesus calls us to this, he sends us into the world to be a light to the world, we are the salt to the world. Let us be in the world but not of the world.

Jesus prayed for us in John 17:14-18

‚ÄúI have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. 15 I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to protect them from the evil one.\[e\] 16 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. 17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.‚Äù

Let us not be worldly people but a people set apart, a chosen generation for the Lord. Let us not defile ourselves with the things of the world. Let us not overly focus on this life but on the next.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

#### February 28,2024

##### Obligations to God

[![Obligations to God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day059.jpg)](https://youtu.be/5e8Tw2TL6CY "Obligations to God")

##### Day 59 ‚ÄúNo exemption for not keeping the Passover/Eucharist‚Äù

We see the strict instruction on how every Israelite was required to keep the Passover. Even if the person was unclean or traveling, there is no excuse. This is a mandatory command of the Lord because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthat‚Äù important. If anyone who is able to keep the Passover chooses not to, he/she will be cut off from the flock. The Passover is the pre-figuration of the Mass. Jesus instituted the Eucharist as the new Passover, we will get to that when we read the New Testament.

But for now, let us learn how important keeping the Passover or attending Mass is, we will be cut off from the flock if we don‚Äôt go to Mass as prescribed by the church.

The Catholic Church makes it very clear ‚ÄúSunday is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation.‚Äù (cf. Canon 1246.1) There are no excuses ‚Äì no holidays or sports qualify ‚Äì we need to go to Mass at least on Sunday or Saturday eve. There are a few exceptions like ‚Äì if you are sick or caring for someone who is sick or if you are elderly or too young.

The other days of obligation (as per the USCCB):

January 1, the solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter, the solemnity of the Ascension
August 15, the solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
November 1, the solemnity of All Saints
December 8, the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception
December 25, the solemnity of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

The word obligation can be misunderstood in two ways,

1. can portray the Eucharist as unappealing, as though the people are forced to go to it

2. as a minimum duty as though they will be saved and are going to heaven for sure

Both those views need to be changed, the Eucharist is the highest form of worship and heaven joins earth ‚Äì if it feels dull and mundane ‚Äì it means we are unaware/under-educated on the true presence of Jesus. As we read through the BIAY ‚Äì it will be slowly unveiled.

One is not saved just by showing up for Mass, sorry that‚Äôs the truth. We need to live the Eucharist out in our lives, the Eucharist we eat should transform us to another Christ. In fact, if we receive communion unworthily, we are sinning and eating and drinking judgment upon ourselves.

27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord. 28 Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29 For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and drink judgment against themselves. 30 For this reason many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. 31 1 Cor 17-31

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Intercessory Prayer

[![Intercessory Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day060.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jnTpnBCISCU "Intercessory Prayer")

##### Day 60: ‚ÄúStubborn people ‚Äì Intercesssory prayer - 40 days 40 nights X TWO ‚Äù

As we read through the journey of the Israelites, we see how the Lord was guiding them so closely. The Lord tells them when to move when to stop ‚Äì they were led by the fire of smoke.

As we read multiple times they start with the tribe of Judah - which means praise (praise should always be the first thing we do). Even though God is leading them and fighting for them - giving them nations much stronger.

The people rebel, they are stubborn, stiff-necked people ‚Äì constantly complaining ‚Äì creating molten images and defiling the Lord.

We see how Moses would go up the mountain ‚Äì fast for 40 days and night ‚Äì interceding and praying for the people. He does this not once but twice ‚Äì once when he received the tablets written by the finger of God ‚Äì he came down and found that the people have made a molten image and started worshiping it. The mounting was fiery and fuming with God‚Äôs anger ‚Äì he went up again and prayed for 40 days and 40 nights - eventually, the Lord accepted the prayer of Moses and spared the people. We are called to pray for the stubborn people in this world. We need to pray for our political leaders, rebel people, greedy authorities, those who have deafened their ears to the Lord.

Let us make a list of stubborn people in our lives ‚Äì from our family, friends, and society. Let us offer them up to the Lord this Lent, as we pray 40 days and 40 nights. Let us ask God to give them strength ‚Äì to see their mistakes and repent.

Let us pray for ourselves ‚Äì for the stubborn bad habits we are unable to kick. Our intercessory pray will make big difference. Pray one whole lent if it does not bring results ‚Äì pray another 40 days and 40 nights. We will not rest our case until the Lord hears us ‚Äì rather until the people, we are praying for change. The Lord is always willing, but the flesh is weak.

Like St Monica who prayed for her whole life for St Augustine ‚Äì we will not give up. We will persevere in prayer and intercession. For we may be praying for the next saint in the church.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us üôè

##### Complaining in the Desert

[![Complaining in the Desert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day061.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1VjA7vISyac "Complaining in the Desert")

##### Day 61: ‚ÄúComplaint of rebellion‚Äù

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves ‚Äì where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us üôè

##### Day 62: ‚ÄúFamily Feud‚Äù

JOKE ALERT: WHAT‚ÄôS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ üòÅ
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses‚Äô wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it‚Äôs important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What‚Äôs important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick ‚Äì the differences disappeared the brothers united ‚Äì Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.

They are having sibling fights because Moses married a Cushite woman.
In God's sight Moses had done nothing wrong in marrying her, if that was so The Lord would have said something about him. Moses is innocent. So The Lord calls all three, and ONLY Miriam is punished. Why?

1. Consequences for our actions.
2. Immediately that unites Aaron and Moses. All three are united in prayer again.

Moses who had been chosen as The Lord's prophet speaking specifically not only with God but on behalf of God.

The greatest miracle that has ever happened is The Incarnation and Redemption Salvation of the world.

Lord, give us the grace to say yes to You in everything.

Remember what The Lord has done.

##### Israel's Rebellion

[![Israel's Rebellion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day063.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0TIAYr9W5pw "Israel's Rebellion")

##### Day 63: ‚ÄúSlow to anger and abounding in mercy‚Äù

The Israelites are a rebellious people, they were delivered from the strongest army ‚Äì the Egyptians. God almighty the great ‚ÄòI AM‚Äô is with them, He delivered them from Egypt ‚Äì with supernatural events ‚Äì the plagues, the parting of the Dead Sea, feeding in the desert, and water from the rock. Even though the Lord led them with a mighty hand and an outreached arm, even though the Lord was fighting for them. The Israelites were rebelling over and over again, they were a rebellious people. They even decided to go back to Egypt, they said let us appoint a captain and go back.

Is this not our story, do we not keep drifting away from the Lord. The Lord has done great things in our lives, he has provided us with a good life ‚Äì and if you can read this today ‚Äì you are more fortunate than half the people in the world or maybe even more, as they are so poor that they do not have internet access. We should stop complaining and remember all the sins the Lord delivered us from, this will help us realize how unworthy we are. We should not think of backsliding or the temporary pleasure we had when we committed sins in the past.

Even though we are so fickle-minded and rebellious, and we continuously fall back into our old sins. The Lord is patient ‚Äì He is slow to anger and abounding in mercy.

We cannot mix the old and the new clothes ‚Äì we cannot carry on with old sins and try to pretend that we are holy. The old has gone and the new has come.

‚ÄúNo one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old" Luke 5:36

Remember that the Lord is patient and is waiting for us to change, He has not left us even though we are not worthy, even though we keep going back to the old sins. May the Lord strengthen us and liberate us from our sinful past.

Also want to call out that we see some Israelites not listening to instructions, getting impatience, and wanting to take on the Amalekites and Canaanites on their own intuition ‚Äì they decided to go out on their own strength without taking the Ark of the covenant or without the guidance of the Lord(the pillar smoke and fire) ‚Äì they FAILED ‚Äì the Amalekites and Canaanites came down and defeated them.

We have to listen to the Lord and wait on Him, not take things into our own hands. Just follow the instructions the Lord gives us and it will be good with us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us üôè

##### Day 63 Maryanne C.M.

+God Hears every murmur against him, n there is a consequence for the same. Let us not murmur even in our hearts.
+The spies took 40 days and for each day they hd to spend a year in wilderness. Hence the 40years in wanderings.
+Those who hd to return with a strategy to proceed, returned with fear n defeat in their words. Acting on the reports of fear, the Israelites make plans to return to slavery!! Let us not be bogged down by the arrows of fear that the enemy strikes at us, but remain in confident faith like Caleb and Joshua.
+"...they were driven by fear and paralysed by distrust that marked their hearts..." Let us not be driven by fear in our lives, in Jesus' Name.
+"... bcoz they were unwilling to battle their children hd to do the battle..."
+"...let us take up arms against whatever enslaves us..."
\+ There is One Place for Worship.
+"...be careful if you r close to d Tabernacle or temple, you may not just eat whatever kind of meat that u wud like to..." This also pertains to other consumptions too, like what we listen to or watch!
+Deut 12 is more connected to worship than just abt eating.

##### Revolt Against Moses

[![Revolt Against Moses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day065.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_ZxhfZw4644 "Revolt Against Moses")

##### Day 65 ‚ÄúWhy are there no women priests in the Catholic Church‚Äù

We see that Moses faced a lot of resistance. We have seen this come up over and over again, people revolt against Moses (actually revolt against the Lord ‚Äì Moses is just following the Lord‚Äôs instructions).

1. We see Aaron and Miriam having an issue with Moses' wife

2. the spies have a problem and refuse to take on the tall people (even though the Lord defeated Egypt -the strongest nation for them)

3. we see a revolt among those who are non-Levites ‚Äì as they want to become priests. (Only Levites were priests -as the Levites ordained themselves by taking a stand for the Lord by destroying the Baal worshipers ‚Äì The Lord commanded that only Levites should be priests)

4. We see that Korah, Dothan, and Abiram accuse Moses of making up the rules and becoming a Price over them.

Moses fell on his face ‚Äì meaning ‚Äì he prayed ‚Äì Moses was genuine ‚Äì he was just doing what the Lord commanded. We see how they insisted, and the Lord answered directly ‚Äì the earth opened and swallowed them up.

We see an increasing demand that Women should be allowed to be Catholic priests. There are a lot of merits to it ‚Äì all of us have mothers and know how caring they are, they would make for a very caring priest. This would also demonstrate equality and help solve the vocation crisis or would have potentially prevented a lot of the sex abuse scandals. The list could go on, but are we not thinking like ‚ÄúKorah, Dothan and Abiram‚Äù ‚Äì let us not think humanly (although it makes a lot of sense and is practical for women to become priests)

There could be many reasons for male priests but would state two.

1. JESUS APPOINTED ONLY MEN AS APOSTLES.

Jesus picked 12 apostles all of whom were men.

Some would say that Jesus was restricted to an era of a male-dominated society ‚Äì I choose to differ ‚Äì Jesus was never influenced by the society - he ate with sinners - tax collectors, prostitutes, pagans, -his disciples did not follow washing of the hands and fasting.

Jesus healed on the sabbath, healed leapers and women with the hemorrhoids touched his cloak. He never bothered about becoming unclean -because He was holiness Himself.

Jesus‚Äô ministry was supported by many women and they were His best followers (even to the cross). Jesus was very caring towards women in the gospel -ex: Mary and Martha. He approached the Samaritan women at the well. He had nothing against women.

Mary his mother would have been a perfect priest ‚Äì as she could literally say this is my body (as Jesus took his human body from her) when she lifted the hosts in consecration. But Jesus chose 12 men ‚Äì it‚Äôs not men who decided that priests should be men. He washed the feet of the apostles in the upper room as we will read later in BIAY ‚Äì washing the feet was a ceremony for anointing.

2. THE PRIEST REPRESENTS CHRIST

The priests are called to embody Christ (Persona Christi) He is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride, we cannot have a female bridegroom (no disrespect to anyone who feels otherwise ‚Äì it‚Äôs the biblical definition of the bridegroom). The Eucharist is a wedding banquet ‚Äì Jesus is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride. Jesus came to this world as a man and the priest needs to embody that. Also by nature/biology, the man provides the seed and the women nurture it and care for it to fulfillment as a baby. In the same way, the priests (Persona Christi) initiate Spiritual children through the sacraments of the church like Baptism, that's why we call the priests fathers as they are spiritual fathers. The church (laity ‚Äì both women and men)like women nurture spiritual children until they reach heaven.

Although like St John Paul II says we need to celebrate the ‚Äúgenius of women‚Äù in the church ‚Äì without women, no parish will last a week. Just look at the many talents and services women do for the functioning of the parish. Their maternal care and love for the priests and the congregation is commendable. Jesus first appeared to a woman and not to a man after He rose from the dead, the first evangelist was a woman. Women are called to greatness and to do great things for the Lord and for the church, to be evangelists, leaders of ministries, heads of councils, proclaimers of the word of God, Eucharistic Ministers, Lectors, counselors, prayer group leaders and even lead communion service(No consecration of bread) and many more ministries to complement the priests in their ministry. Men are priests not because they are better than women but because of the nature of Christ.

Hope my reflection was clear and to the point. We are called to worship God as He wants us to not how we want to.

If you have other opinions, I respect them and we are still brothers and sisters in Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Forbidden Forms of Worship

[![Forbidden Forms of Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day066.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Rn4UHDqh0F0 "Forbidden Forms of Worship")

##### Day 66: Forbidden forms of worship ‚Äì Magic, horoscopes, fortune-telling

We see the stern warning of the Lord that is given to the Israelites ‚Äì preparing them for entry into the promised land.

‚ÄúWhen you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations. 10 No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead.‚Äù Deuteronomy 18

There are some practices that have crept into our daily lives without us discerning properly?

One common thing is reading the daily horoscope prediction ‚Äì or following sun signs.

For example ‚Äì Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. I got a kick out of this description as I am supposedly Aries ;) but It‚Äôs BS üòÄ There are so many Aries who are just the opposite. Hehe.

People read their fortune in the horoscope columns and believe it, or go to a Psychic, tarot card reader, or palm reader. It‚Äôs just like having a sun, moon, or star god, or believing that the stars and creation rule our lives instead of the creator.

Some people use spirit mediums to get solutions or to conjure the dead. There is an increase in satanism and occult practices. Witchcraft, voodoo dolls, and black magic are common in some cultures. They are allowing after-school Satanist clubs now, remember they threw out the 10 commandments and now allow this.

There are also new age practices each person is their own divinity ‚Äì I‚Äôm my own god.

Many people follow superstations as well like ‚Äì black cat crossing your path, touch wood, a horseshoe for good luck, sports superstitions.

All of these are placing our trust in the created things or practices, it's literally telling God that we trust in things of the world rather than in Almighty God.

We are breaking the first commandment the great Shema ‚Äì

‚ÄúHear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might‚Äù" Deut 6

‚ÄúSome trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.‚Äù Ps 20:7

Let us not put our lives and trust in created things, we owe that to the creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè

##### Day 67 Anonymous

You care for justice, You care for us. Thank You Lord!

All the tribes of Israel were given land, property, etc. as their inheritance. But Levites were not given any inheritance, because The Lord Himself was their inheritance. The tithes would be given to them for their support and food.
Levites also have to give a tenth of their tithes from what they are receiving as tithes.
Wars of judgement
People of Cannan were living violent lives. God is using people of Israel to exact justice
You need to be faithful because thru you I am going to bless the people. God gives commandment knowing they wouldn't keep them.

##### Reflection - Cathy Aggarao

This makes me reflect how priests come from a family, first. And the importance of making our family a domestic church. The active participation of families in parish and sacramental life leads to more young ones entering religious life or faithful professionals. I like how we are called to be sensitive to the needs of the religious and priesthood since we benefit from their works.
üôèMother Mary, please pray for more youth to be open to religious and priestly life. Amen.

##### Day 69 Why do Catholic churches have a Crucifix and holy statues

The Catholics get a lot of flak for worshiping the crucifix or statues. We see the Israelites speak against God and against Moses again saying

‚ÄúWhy have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.‚Äù 6 Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. 7 The people came to Moses and said, ‚ÄúWe have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.‚Äù So Moses prayed for the people. 8 And the Lord said to Moses, ‚ÄúMake a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.‚Äù 9 So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.

We see that those who sin and repented had to go and look at the pole and the serpent. Is God commanding idol worship here. No really ‚Äúthe pole and serpent‚Äù is just an icon for the people to pray to God, it was a place where people gathered to pray.

In the New Testament, Jesus brings this up again John 3.

And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

The Crucifix in the catholic church reminds us that Jesus became sin for us ‚Äì he was cursed for our inequities ‚Äì Jesus hangs on the cross with all our sin on Him ‚Äì that‚Äôs why He looked so distressed and humiliated ‚Äì when we look at the crucifix we need to be reminded of our sin ‚Äì just as the Israelites looked at the bronze serpent and remembered their rebellion and their complaining ‚Äì when they looked up to the bronze serpent they were healed. They are not healed by the pole and the serpent ‚Äì but it serves as a reminder to ask God for healing.

In the same way, when Catholics pray at a crucifix or statue they are not praying or worshiping it ‚Äì it is just an Icon to remember our sin and to ask God to heal us and give us eternal life.

The Holy statues are just icons of holy men and women whose example we ought to follow. I haven't met any catholic who worships a statue. üòÄ Maybe you have, please introduce them to me. üòÇ

##### The Offense of Balaam

[![The Offense of Balaam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day070.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YTiFAPUE15A "The Offense of Balaam")

##### Day 70 ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs perfect will and permissive will‚Äù, ‚ÄúTalking donkey and angels - what? ‚Äù

We read about Balaam the soothsayer/prophet, going against the Lord‚Äôs command. Balaam initially accepted the Lord‚Äôs instruction about not cursing God‚Äôs chosen (this was God‚Äôs perfect will) and when Balaam was influenced with more money and influential people, he gave in. The Lord said OKAY you can go but you will say what I tell you (God‚Äôs permissive will).

We encounter this every day in our lives, we know what God wants of us ‚Äì but we get influenced by this world ‚Äì money and famous people tell us what to do. Even in the big decisions in life we tend to avoid God‚Äôs call ‚Äì someone called to the religious life avoids it and regrets it later ‚Äì the Lord is faithful even if we are not ‚Äì he never leaves us and gives us the freedom to choose. Let us periodically spend time to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit to discern God‚Äôs will and let‚Äôs pray for the grace to accept His perfect will in our lives.

Like Jonah, the Lord will eventually take us on the path He predestined for us. The only difference is ‚Äì if we listen to God‚Äôs voice we will have less resistance - less time in the fish's belly.

We see this incredible miracle of a talking donkey ‚Äì the common knowledge is that donkeys are dumb animals. However we see that the dumb one was the human being, in this case, the donkey's eyes were opened to see the angel ‚Äì with the drawn sword ‚Äì the donkey was so good ‚Äì trying to save Balaam‚Äôs life and its own I guess. We so often forget the spiritual realm. There are angels around us ‚Äì our guardian angel and other angels that protect us.

For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways;
12 they will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. Ps 91

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
and he delivers them. Ps 34

Let us be aware of the lovely angels around us and don‚Äôt forget to pet your dog/cat. üòÄ

##### Day 71 ‚ÄúIf the Lord opens a door no one can close it‚Äù

We see Balak just won‚Äôt give up, he makes Balaam try again and again. Even though they build multiple alters and offer bulls and rams ‚Äì the Lord will not change, what is man that he can attempt to change God‚Äôs mind/will.

As we live our Christian lives ‚Äì we will have a lot of resistance, pushback, and even opposition. Do not worry the Lord is on our side, God is fighting for us.

Like Balak and Balaam, anyone against us (God‚Äôs chosen people) will have to say.

‚ÄúHe can I curse who God has not cursed‚Äù v8

‚Äú Behold I receive a command to bless; he has blessed and I cannot revoke it ‚Äùv20 Numbers 23

Remember that nothing will happen to us that the Lord does not allow.

‚ÄúNo weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from Me,‚Äù Says the Lord‚Äù (Isaiah 54:17).

Our God is for us and on our side, what can man do.

31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Rom 8

Just how ‚Äì no nation could stop God‚Äôs people from entering the promised land. No one can close the door the Lord has opened in your life.

‚ÄúBrave Soldier - Be positive, look up, and move on. He is with us. ‚Äú

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 71 - Jenita

Living life as a Christian is challenging. Because always seem to be in a battle between our conscience and our desires. Even though we are rooted in God's words we waver from the plan God has for us.

But nothing can stop God's protection over us. So we just need to trust in God and move forward.

[![The Plains of Moab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day072.jpg)](https://youtu.be/86QY0R3QZ9c "The Plains of Moab")

##### Day 72 ‚ÄúRid yourself, family, and society of sin‚Äù

We see how faithful God is to the Israelites. We see the Lord is preventing Balaam from cursing the Israelites, he is unable to curse despite the pressure Balak put on him. The Lord has been leading the Israelites through the wilderness ‚Äì feeding them and defeating many nations along the way ‚Äì they are about to enter the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey. The Israelites should be praising God and worshiping Him, however, they are doing awful things to displease the Lord. They are doing shameful things with the Moabite women. Apart from going to the neighboring town one of the sons of Israel even brought a Midianite woman ‚Äì walked past weeping Moses and Levites ‚Äì and defiled the inner room of the tent. This would be like performing sexual acts on the altar of a catholic church. Phinehas a priest got up and put them to death and this stopped the plague.

I think the problem today is we have become comfortable with sin. We do not deal with sin as we should, we accept bad behavior and do not correct it. For example ‚Äì earlier it was shameful for anyone to have sex before marriage or for anyone to live together before marriage. But today ‚Äì everyone is very casual about the idea of living together before marriage just so that you can know the person and see if they are compatible. I don‚Äôt think this is working ‚Äì look at the divorce rate it is through the roof.

We have become cowardly ‚Äì if we see our kids doing this, we are afraid to correct them lest they stop talking to us. We are answerable to God; we have failed to correct our children and grandchildren.

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prob 13:24

Also, we tend to be timid with sin in our own lives. Sin can be imagined as a baby serpent ‚Äì we should be running away from it; however, we keep it in our pocket - and bring it out every little while. One day this small serpent will become a huge anaconda and swallow us up.

Be aware!! Be aware!! of sin.

8 Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.1 Pet 5:8

Let us first discipline ourselves, then our children/family and then the society. This will stop the plague of the culture of death.

##### Day 73 ‚ÄúCatholic guilt‚Äù

We read in today‚Äôs Psalm about the fear of the Lord.

‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding.‚Äù Ps111:10

The fear of the Lord is indeed the beginning of wisdom, but what is the fear of the Lord. Am I supposed to be afraid of God, or am I supposed to be afraid of His wrath? Not true, we are not called to fear God, He is a loving and caring God ‚Äì a God who sent His only son to die for us, the Father who knit us together in our mother‚Äôs womb, the Lord who does not slumber but watches over us, the one who knows when we come in and go out when we sit down and raise up, even before a word is on our lips ‚Äì He knows it. We cannot be afraid of God ‚Äì His nature is love itself.

What does the ‚Äúfear of the Lord‚Äù mean ‚Äì it means we should be afraid not to hurt Him who loves us much. We should be fearful to not offend Him, Him who loves us so deeply. We should be fearful to not let Him down, not to betray Him, when we have an opportunity to talk about Him.

The word ‚ÄúCatholics guilt‚Äù gets tossed around a lot. Folks tend to say that ‚ÄúCatholics are not even sure of their salvation‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúThat they have an over-emphasis on their sin‚Äù ‚Äì and ‚ÄúThat they are running to confession all the time‚Äù --- All of those are NOT true ‚Äì absolutely not true.

Catholics are very discerning and reverend people ‚Äì we are not "a free for all ‚Äì anything goes" type of people. We are serious about sin we define it very well, the catechism lists out all types of sin ‚Äì venial and mortal, the deadly sins, the modern terms of sin (for example we have good definitions of sin like abortion, pornography, homosexuality, masturbation, rape, etc ) We are conscious of our sins, we carefully examine our hearts and go to confession. Once we make a confession ‚Äì we know for a fact that our sins are forgiven ‚Äì no doubt at all.

‚Äúwhoever's sins you forgive are forgiven them‚Äù Jh 20‚Äù23

We come out rejoicing and celebrating ‚Äì also heaven rejoices over one repented person than over 99 who don't need to.

Usually what people are referring to when they say Catholic guilt is a heresy called ‚ÄúJansenism‚Äù from the 17th and 18th centuries.

Jansenism was an early modern theological movement within Catholicism, primarily active in the Kingdom of France, that emphasized original sin, human depravity, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination. It was declared a heresy by the Catholic Church.

In conclusion, the Catholics are very cognizant of their state of grace ‚Äì their sin, once confessed it's forgiven and it‚Äôs out of the mind and we are a celebrating, rejoicing, and happy people.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 74 ‚ÄúMen and women are equal ‚Äì both created in God‚Äôs image‚Äù

We see in today‚Äôs reading the daughters of Zelophehad - 5 of them came forward to demand equality for inheritance. Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah come up before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

What courage they must have had ‚Äì to take a stand before the congregation.

‚ÄúOur father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons. 4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father‚Äôs brothers.‚Äù Numbers 27:3,4

Moses needed to seek God‚Äôs guidance on this and sure enough the Lord said ‚Äì yes Men and women are equal ‚Äì the daughters should be given their due.

Moses brought their case before the Lord. 6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 7 The daughters of Zelophehad are right in what they are saying; you shall indeed let them possess an inheritance among their father‚Äôs brothers and pass the inheritance of their father on to them. Numbers 27:5-8

When God created man and women ‚Äì He made no difference between the two. He created them both in His image.

So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. Gen 1:27

In Jesus‚Äô earthly life he always took up for women the widows the orphans. Many women were his followers and supporters. Two of his good friends were Mary and Martha ‚Äì and their brother Lazarus. Scripture scholars believed that Lazarus was physically challenged or very sick. The Greek word "asthenes" can be translated as "sick," "without strength," "feeble" or "insignificant."

Due to his condition, Lazarus was unable to care for the family and his sisters were not married because they had to care for Lazarus. Jesus loved them so dearly and cared for them ‚Äì even brought back Lazarus to life.

Our God created everyone equal, men and women, black, white and brown, short, tall, weak, strong, smart, simple, special, normal. Jesus loves us all the same.

Let us stop hate or discrimination ‚Äì we are called to love as God loves. Love everyone equally.

##### Day 75 ‚ÄúFind your rest in the Lord‚Äù

We see the command to do no laborious work on the various feasts, the feast of the trumpets, the feast of booths, the feast of weeks‚Ä¶ We read in the creation story that even God rested on the 7th day.

When something is repeated over and over again, that means it is very important. God wants us to be very clear about finding rest on Sunday. We work a lot all week long, from office work to household chores to running errands, all of which are mostly aimed at the earthly necessities ‚Äì our calendars are full of that. God does not want us to be like Robots ‚Äì working 24X7. We need to stop all this craziness at least on Sunday, turn our focus from business and work and other activities to nourish our souls.

Our focus on Sunday should be to go to church, not just show up ‚Äì but prepare for it ‚Äì study the Sunday scriptures in advance, examine our conscience may be on Saturday, and go to confession (prepare ourselves ‚Äì have a day of atonement). Pick out the proper attire and keep it ready for Sunday Mass ‚Äì remember it‚Äôs a wedding banquet that we are going to.

Also, "rest" meant that the Israelites would just stay in their tents and be with family. We should make use of Sunday for that ‚Äì just stay home and delight in the family. Talk to each other/play board games or just cook out in the backyard.

In the gospel when Martha brought a complaint against Mary, Jesus said that the rest that Mary found listening to Him will not be taken away.

But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, ‚ÄúLord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.‚Äù 41 But the Lord answered her, ‚ÄúMartha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; 42 there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.‚Äù Luke 10:40-42

I hope we can be true to ourselves ‚Äì not be distracted by many tasks but like Mary choose to sit at the feet of the Lord, as we enjoy our Sunday Mass and family time. If we pick this better part, it will not be taken away from us.

28 ‚ÄúCome to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.‚Äù Matt 11:28-30

##### War Against Midian

[![War Against Midian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day076.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lFFqQFmWLmY "War Against Midian")

##### Day 76 ‚ÄúThe freedom to choose ‚Äì Choose life‚Äù

We read in today‚Äôs reading about choice, God gives us a choice, He could have just created us like rocks, trees, or wild animals that only have instinct. We have a rationale or reason and a choice, a choice to do good or bad to pick God or Evil.

The Catechism teaches

CCC 1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him."26

I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, 20 loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the Lord swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. Deuteronomy 30:19-20

In today‚Äôs scripture reading, we see God laying it out very clearly ‚Äì He says that we need to pick either good or bad, life or death, blessing or curses. The choices we make allow God to save us. We are saved by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and resurrection ‚Äì but we need to choose Jesus over sin. God will empower us to live a holy life and make good choices. Choices that bring blessings and a future in heaven. We need to make choices in life ‚Äì choices that are pro-life and not pro-death, pro-choice at every stage from conception to natural death.

Our first parents Adam and Eve had a choice ‚Äì but they messed up they picked evil over good ‚Äì they listened to what the devil said over what God said. Even though they messed up ‚Äì God gave us many more changes ‚Äì which the Israelites kept messing up. Eventually, God gave us a new Eve ‚Äì Mary who said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to God, and a new Adam ‚Äì Jesus who said Yes to the will of the Father.

If we find ourselves in a place where we have made bad choices, let‚Äôs not fret ‚Äì we need to return to God.

return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you Deut 30:2-3

We need to choose God, blessings flow when we choose God.

Psalm 91 starts with ‚ÄúHe who dwells in the shelter of the Most High ‚Äù then the many blessings of protection are listed, but we need to dwell in Him first.

Also, Psalm 23 starts with ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd‚Äù We need to make the Lord our shepherd which will bring many blessings ‚Äì we will not be in need, He will make us lie down in green pastures, our cup will overflow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### God is Faithful

[![God is Faithful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day077.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LknGGOf2Ge4 "God is Faithful")

##### Day 77 ‚ÄúBe strong and of good courage ‚Äì the Lord goes with you, He will not fail you or forsake you‚Äù

Moses is getting up in age and it‚Äôs time for him to pass. Moses has lived a long life, a life of service ‚Äì he was brought up in royalty ‚Äì the Lord led him out of that comfortable life and made him the leader of the Israelites ‚Äì he spent most of his life in the wilderness ‚Äì the people of Israel have been revolting, complaining and falling into sin over and over again. God even tells Moses that after he dies the people are going to go back into sin and forsake the Lord. Even though the Lord will lead them into the promised land, the land flowing with milk and honey ‚Äì they will despise Him even in their prosperity.

For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant. Deut 31:20

BUT ‚Äì even though the people backslide and give in to their own desires ‚Äì God is faithful He is fighting for them and will never ever leave them. Even though we are unfaithful, God is faithful. He will remember His covenant from generation to generation. Even though we sin He is merciful. The Psalmist proclaims this in today‚Äôs Psalm

For great is his mercy towards us; and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Ps 117

If we examine our own lives, we see the same pattern of sin. We have complaints and grumbling when things go wrong, when we get sick or have so sufferings ‚Äì we forsake the Lord. Even when we are prosperous, we forget the Lord, just like the Israelites who were given everything a land flowing with milk and honey ‚Äì yet they turned to other gods and served them. So we cannot blame our circumstances or condition as we forsake the Lord when we are "in need" and when we are "full".

Our God loves us despite our sinfulness and shortcomings.

Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person‚Äîthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. Rom 5:7

Let us not be discouraged by our sin, but encouraged by God‚Äôs mercy and faithfulness. Let's remember this famous quote from St Faustina.

The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. - St Faustina

We need to read those words that Moses used to encourage Joshua. Maybe read it a few times and be encouraged today that God is Merciful and Faithful.

Be strong and of good courage, do not fear or be in dread of them: for it is the Lord your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you.‚Äù Deut 31:6

#### March 18,2024

##### The Song of Moses

[![The Song of Moses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day078.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E1dXrYOBedk "The Song of Moses")

##### Day 78 ‚ÄúListen to the right music ‚Äì it impacts us‚Äù ‚ÄúThe one who sings prays twice"

I‚Äôm sure you have had a song stuck in your head, usually, it‚Äôs the refrain of a song or a line or the melody that keeps playing nonstop and you can‚Äôt get it out of your head. More than 90% of adults report that this happens to them at least once a week. Research suggests that songs may get stuck due to repetitive lyrics that activate the brain's reward system. There is some interesting science about how music can affect us, it stirs up emotions and memories and even leads us to do certain actions.

We see that the Lord who created and programmed us, uses this faculty of the human being ‚Äì God knew that after Moses' death, the Israelites would fall into sin again, even after they enter the promised land and received everything they needed, they would still sin. God gave Moses a song that the people would sing and memories and get stuck in their heads. This was preparation for the time they would fall into sin and then this song would remind them of God‚Äôs goodness and they would return to God.

In the desert wondering, most of the commandments would have been taught verbally and they would call an assembly of the people are read the commandments of the Lord over and over again.

I think we should learn something from this, if we listen to music with very a negative message or hate, we will eventually become that. If we listen to Christian music that has the word of God in its lyrics, we will praise God while we listen and the songs and lyrics will also get stored in our brain and be brought up when we need it.

I listen to good music, even when I‚Äôm working ‚Äì the brain is powerful enough to praise God and work at the same time. Let us find some good Christina music and binge-listen.

Not only listen, but we also got to sing it as well. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have a good voice.

The bible says - Make a joyful noise

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:

be thankful unto him, and bless his name. PS 100:1,4

St. Augustine had this very famous saying

‚ÄúThe one who sings prays twice‚Äù.

##### Psalms of Ascent

[![Psalms of Ascent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day079.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VHkF-YokdRE "Psalms of Ascent")

##### Day 79: ‚ÄúMoses‚Äô great example to "Bless those who curse you"‚Äù

As we read the final blessing of Moses, Man-O-Man what a gem of a person Moses. The people of Israel were not ‚Äúhappy campers‚Äù they companied, and they accused Moses of so many things ‚Äì they were afraid that the Egyptian army would kill them, complaints about lack of water, food, no meat, no garlic, fear of fighting tribes with tall people, they were a people that never headed Moses‚Äô words(God‚Äôs instruction) and stiff-necked people.

But Moses did not count all their failures and say "you cursed people, you ruined my life, I could not even see the promised land". Instead, Moses blesses them, and does not curse them. There is a lesson to learn, we are called to bless and not curse.

Even if people are hard to handle and can get in our hair, we must have a heart like Moses that blesses and not curses. We need a heart of Jesus that is able to say ‚ÄúFather forgive them for they know not what they are doing‚Äù

bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 29 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak do not withhold your coat as well. Luke 6:28-29

##### Cities of Refuge

[![Cities of Refuge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day080.jpg)](https://youtu.be/MkrOjI8JEdk "Cities of Refuge")

##### Day 80 ‚ÄúGod is watching over us ‚Äì 24X7‚Äù

Sometimes, we can feel that God is distant or not concerned about us. We may experience loneliness and even go into depression if we do not get the help and support, we need.

Let us be reminded that God is aware of everything that is happening in our lives. The Psalm in today‚Äôs readings is a big reminder that God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord is our keeper, He will be our shade and not let our foot be moved. Apart from protecting us physically, He will preserve our souls. He will keep us from evil from this time on and forevermore. Another Psalm that reminds us of this is "Psalm 139" ‚Äì God knows when we sit down, rise up, come in, go out, He knows our times of activity and rest, even before a word is on our lips He already knows it.

When it was time for the Israelites to go and worship the Lord and offer their sacrifices and tithes. They would have to go up (even if they were in the North) because they were going up to Mount Zion. Imagine going on a trek up the mountain ascending the mountain to pray. What would our attitude be?

Can‚Äôt help but admire the trust the psalmist had in the Lord. The Psalmist looked up to the hills, looked up to the skies, and looked up to God. He did not look at the problems or difficulties around him, but lifted up his eyes and set his gaze on the Lord.

I lift my eyes up to the hills, from where does my help come?

We should fix our gaze on Jesus, we should not be overly obsessed with our own problems and issues. Because our help comes from the Lord. And as we look up let us remember that God is always lovingly looking at us. He cares for us.

Let us just read today‚Äôs Psalm and pray it again. In fact, we should pray it every day, it will remind us that God is watching over us.

I lift up my eyes to the hills‚Äî

from where will my help come?

2 My help comes from the Lord,

who made heaven and earth.

3 He will not let your foot be moved;

he who keeps you will not slumber.

4 He who keeps Israel

will neither slumber nor sleep.

5 The Lord is your keeper;

the Lord is your shade at your right hand.

6 The sun shall not strike you by day,

nor the moon by night.

7 The Lord will keep you from all evil;

he will keep your life.

8 The Lord will keep

your going out and your coming in

from this time on and forevermore.

PS 121

Congratulations on completing two books Numbers and Deuteronomy. 80 days of reading God‚Äôs word. It feels Awesome. Praise the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Israel Crosses the Jordan

[![Israel Crosses the Jordan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day081.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6e_ec2fwcPA "Israel Crosses the Jordan")

##### Day 81 ‚ÄúStack up stones of good memories, remember what the Lord has done‚Äù

Human tendency is to forget, forget the good things that have been done to us. One usually clings to negative things or experiences. The people of Israel started their journey with the parting of the Red Sea ‚Äì it was a great miracle and one to be remembered forever. However, the people forgot it too soon, they kept doubting the Lord and complaining from time to time. Now the Lord our faithful God has journeyed with them, guiding them by smoke and fire every step of the way. The Lord also prepared their hearts to enter the promised land, they were given the 10 commandments and detailed instructions on moral law, details about worship. They are ready to enter the promised land ‚Äì a land flowing with milk and honey.

The desert wanderings started with the parting of the read sea and ends with the parting of the Jordan ‚Äì as soon as the feet of those carrying the Tabernacle entered the Jordan the river stopped flowing (again this should not be assumed as low tide/water ‚Äì there is a mention that the Jordan usually overflowed its banks) - the Lord commanded each tribe to pick one stone from the dept of the banks of the river Jordan ‚Äì to remind them that the Lord did dry up the Jordan. This would be a memory for generations to come so that the Israelites would remember the faithfulness of the Lord. Just as each tribe picked up one stone from the depts of the Jordan, we need to pick up something when we are going through the depts/difficult times(sickness, job loss, losing a loved one, etc) ‚Äì to remember that the Lord has brought us through it.

We need to have some way to remember the good things the Lord has done for us. Just as we pick up souvenirs when we visit a new place. A prayer journal is a good idea, highlighting your bible, writing up reflections. I have all my reflections from day 1 till now stored in a file, I plan to read them as I go through the BIAY again maybe in 2024, (if Ascension does the catechism in a year in 2023)

We need to memorize the word of God as well, as the Lord commanded to write them on the doorposts and on your garments. We need to read and re-read the living word of God until it is written on our hearts.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 81 -  Jenita

üé∂"God will make a way, where there seems to be no way"üé∂

This song certainly rings a jingle in my head, as it very much speaks of how God does the unimaginable to make us move forward in this journey of life.

Whatever maybe our situation, whatever be our position in life.. We must remember that we serve a faithful God who does marvelous miracles which cannot be explained by human intelligence. We serve a God will will move mountains and part seas and rivers just so we can go into green pastures.

We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we in testing times we may look at these rocks(miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope.

He will never leave us nor forsake us! !!

What a mighty God we serve

##### Day 81 - Gabriella

Commenting on *Jenita‚Äôs* note above, I totally agree with her heartfelt reflection.

*We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we are in testing times we may look at these rocks (miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope.*

These words reminded me of our Lord‚Äôs
üåπBlessed Mother, Our Lady Undoer of Knots Novena, meditation part for day 4 as it reads:

*O Mother, ask Jesus to heal my paralytic faith which gets down hearted with the stones on the road.*

\*Along with you, dearest Mother, may I see these stones as friends. Not murmuring against them anymore but giving endless thanks for them, may I smile trustingly in your power.\*‚Ä®‚Ä®\_*Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Mary is the Sun and no one is deprived of her warmth.*\_

Praise God for His steadfast love and mercy through Her endless intercession!

*Deuteronomy 31:8*
‚ÄúThe LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.‚Äù

[![The Valley of Achor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day082.jpg)](https://youtu.be/D-UdZ6xWcWw "The Valley of Achor")

##### Day 82 Holding on to sin

We are all aware of the fall of Jericho, the great and fortified city that was standing in the way of the Israelites entering the promised land. An angel with a drawn sword appeared to Joshua and said the same thing that was said to Moses at the start of Moses Exodus ‚Äì ‚ÄúPut off the shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy‚Äù. Joshua like Moses in the burning bush experienced a closeness to the Lord, something that would help them lead the people confidently.

The Lord gave Joshua special instructions to march around the city with the ark of the covenant for 7 days with trumpet blasts and on day 7 the walls of Jericho would fall. I guess we do similar prayers when we take the Eucharistic Lord in processions around the neighborhood.

The Lord instructed the Israelites not to take anything from the land that they conquered, lest these things defile them. However, Achan was lured into collecting some of the spoils. Because of his sin, the Lord was not with Israel when they attempted to capture this tiny hill city of Ai. The sin of Achan caused 36 good Israelites to be slain by the Ai. Even after seeing this Achan did not come forth, his sin had to be revealed by the Lord. That is when they had to stone Achan in the valley of Achor (trouble/sadness/destruction/shame), let us be reminded that it is our own sin that brings destruction, God does not want to see us get hurt or lose our soul.

Let us take a life lesson from this, we should not hold on to certain sins. One usually tends to hold onto a few favorite sins, the ones we really enjoy. Let us pray for the strength to let go of the things of the world, lest we lose our souls.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![The Gibeonite Trickery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day083.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UM8fMnMckKM "The Gibeonite Trickery")

##### Day 83 Strategy and deception

We see how Joshua was instructed to use a Military ambush strategy to conquer Ai. Just yesterday we read how Ai defeated the Israelites because the Lord was not with them. The Lord can use our mistakes and write straight with crooked lines, the Lord asked Joshua to set ambush soldiers and then flee as they did the previous time, once the Ai men started following the fleeing Israelites the Ambush soldiers would go in and set the city on fire. The Lord used the mistakes of the Israelites to bring victory. We also read of the hasty decision that the Israelites made towards making a covenant with the Gibeonites, the Gibeonites deceived the Israelites pretending to have come from far away. However, the Lord blesses this decision and graphs the Gibeonites into the Israelites. We will see how the Gibeonites will bear very useful people in the future.

In our lives we may have made wrong decisions may be married the wrong person, took up the wrong job, wasted out family inheritance, did bad things when we were young ‚Äì like drugs/alcohol/guns, maybe even have a criminal record. Let us not be disheartened but entrust everything to the Lord for our God can use our scares to bring healing to the nations.

All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose: Romans 8:28

Also, we need to have a strategy to defeat our enemies, our enemy is sin and the devil. We need to learn how to avoid sin, for example ‚Äì if you struggle with sins of gossip, then give yourself a time limit when you talk about others or choose to never name people ‚Äì use words like us instead of him/her.

If you struggle with lust, then ensure you are never along with your devices.

If you struggle with anger, then have a strategy to never speak until you calm down.

Come up with a strategy to fight and burn up sin in our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Sun Stands Still

[![The Sun Stands Still](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day084.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8f0RhYsVK_g "The Sun Stands Still")

##### Day 84 Nature obeys God

God is the creator of everything and everything is in place just by His will. If God wills the sun to stop shining, it will. We see in today‚Äôs reading how the surrounding Kings are plotting to join forces and kill the Israelites. However they do not know that they are actually fighting against God, we read that there were more men slain by Hailstones as compared to by the sword.

the Lord threw down huge stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword. Josh 10:11

The Lord was fighting for them, they won not by the power of their army, but by the mighty hand of the Lord. The Lord made the sun stand still until the Israelites won.

There are many examples even in our modern times where we see nature obey God‚Äôs people. For example, the spinning of the sun at Fathima.

The Miracle of the Sun (Portuguese: Milagre do Sol), also known as the Miracle of F√°tima, is a series of events reported to have occurred miraculously on 13 October 1917, attended by a large crowd who had gathered in F√°tima, Portugal, in response to a prophecy made by three shepherd children, L√∫cia Santos and Francisco and Jacinta Marto. The prophecy was that the Virgin Mary (referred to as Our Lady of F√°tima), would appear and perform miracles on that date. Newspapers published testimony from witnesses who said that they had seen extraordinary solar activity, such as the Sun appearing to "dance" or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors. According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes.

Also, St Thomas Apostle of India did some great miracles ‚Äì to convert the Hindu's who believed nature was God.

According to tradition, St. Thomas made his first conversions by a miracle. At the village of Palur, he found some Brahman priests throwing handfuls of water into the air as they performed their purification prayers. Thomas threw some water into the air himself, and it hung suspended in the form of sparkling flowers. Tradition continues that most of the Brahmans embraced Christianity on the spot, and that the rest fled

Speaking about nature gods, the native Americans in Mexico and around worshiped Aztec gods of the sun and the moon, when I visited Mexico City I went to the huge pyramids of the sun and the moon gods. That‚Äôs when the Miraculous picture of our lady was given to the people, Our Lady of Guadalupe has the moon under her feet and the sun behind her, she has stars in her mantle ‚Äì however, her eyes were looking downwards in humility depicting that she is not God. This image was not painted -it supernaturally appeared when the peasant Juan Diego ‚Äì tried to show the flowers he collected on the hill to the Bishop, there was a bright light and the painting appeared.

There are so many mysterious attributes to the image ‚Äì it never faded after centuries ‚Äì even though it was on a poor-quality peasants cloak, the painting technique understood, there was a bomb blast next to it but it wasn‚Äôt destroyed, the eyes have exact imagery that is seen in a natural eye ‚Äì with actual people seen in the retina.

This image converted millions of people to the faith.

##### Day 85: Equality

We see how just the Lord is in the allocation of the lands to the tribes of Israel. The smaller tribes are given smaller lands and bigger tribes larger lands. When God created Adam and Eve, he created them equal ‚Äì in His own image. However due to the hardness of heart and greed the human race has become very selfish and corrupt. The heart of God is generous, however, the human hearts are growing selfish by the day. People are overly-focused on their own needs and are becoming very self-centered to the extent of neglecting the poor, weak, marginalized. Every nation wants to be a superpower, every corporation wants to become the leader and every human being wants to be boss.

We need to realize that we are trying to fill our lives with a lot of stuff, a lot of money, things, people, pleasure, luxury.

Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. Ecclesiastes 5:10

Noting will satisfy us like God, we will be ever hungry and thirsty until we find our rest in the Lord.

Saint Augustine states ‚ÄúYou have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.‚Äù

Let us try to have a heart like God‚Äôs heart, let us look at everyone with equality and treat everyone as though they are a child of God. Let money, color, religion, ethnicity, social status, fame, spirituality never come in the way we look at our neighbor.

##### Day 86 Hidden treasures in Challenges

We read that the tribe of Joseph was given only one portion even though they were a tribe with numerous people. The Tribe brought this up with Joshua, they felt that there were not treated with justice because all the other tribes were given an inheritance according to their size.

But the Lord through Joshua has better plans ‚Äì something that the tribe of Joseph did not see.

The portion that was given to them was next to the forest, Joshua told them that once they cleared the forest they will have a really huge portion. Also, the Lord had given them a lot of strong people who could do just that.

Sometimes we feel that God has not given us what we deserve, that we are given a smaller portion as compared to others or that we are given an oversized cross to carry.

Let us not feel discouraged but let us pray that God shows us what is in store for us.

What if the sufferings are actually a blessing, what if the cross is our path to redemption, what if the sickness is actually what keeps us close to the Lord, and what if the sin is what keeps us humble.

This song drives the point home.

If we remember ‚Äúthe slap that was heard around the world.‚Äù I not going to say who‚Äôs right and wrong, I feel both had their part to play. There are positives ‚Äì Chris Rock wanted people to laugh and be cheerful, and Will smith was just protective of his wife. However, the thing that was surprising was that it happened at the Oscars, it‚Äôs is not the place for violence. Human beings can‚Äôt be predicted, they say things that shouldn‚Äôt be said, people snap, angry becomes fury in seconds.
God creates cities of refuge because He knows how fragile human beings are. The city of refuge was meant to be a place where there is no violence. If someone kills another person by accident ‚Äì there needs to be a place where they can hide from those seeking vengeance. We need to be grateful that we live in a far more civilized world, with police and armed forces and governments.
However, this security is violated sometimes ‚Äì leaders like Putin seem to be getting away with violating the basic human freedom that the Ukrainians should be allowed to have. Power, Pleasure, and Pride are the big three P‚Äôs that seem to be the driving force behind all evil people.
The rest of the world needs to be a city of Refuge for the Ukrainian people. We should protect them from physical harm and help them heal emotionally. We see similar situations in Haiti and with the situation in Gaza/Isreal.
Let us also be a city of refuge for our friends and family who are suffering. Let us be available to them, be a shoulder to cry on, always gave a listening heart, support them and help them as needed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 87

Today we learn that Joshua and Caleb were the only two men who experienced the wandering and conquest in the leaving of Egypt.
The practice of taking one's life was a long feud to settle, hence asylum were established to provide for those accidental cases.
Besides the Levites, priests were given free allotments of land as they were to teach God's Law to the people.
God fulfilled the promised to the lsraelites even in the midst of hardship and sufferings.
Hence the Psalm brings calmness and hope. When a soul with gratitude asks for forgiveness and deliverance, God forgives and gives confidence to those who wait confidently and expectantly for Him.

##### Joshua's Last Words to Israel

[![Joshua's Last Words to Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day088.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1-MxicO_rxY "Joshua's Last Words to Israel")

##### Day 88 ‚ÄúAs for me and my house, we will serve the Lord‚Äù

Joshua served the Lord well when his time to pass came ‚Äì he summoned all the leaders of Israel. Joshua was the one who helped them cross over into the Promised land, he was instrumental in allotting the land to each tribe. Joshua leaves them with a decision, a decision that each one of us has to make as well. Choose this day whom you will serve, will you serve the Lord or will you serve other gods.

We usually procrastinate over matters of spirituality. Most people don‚Äôt think twice to book a vacation getaway, buy a new phone, or trade in their car for a new one. However, it will take forever to go to confession or on a retreat. Let the words of Joshua disturb you today.

"Choose this day whom you will serve"

Today is the day, you have to decide if you will serve the Lord or your own desires. Let us not put off matters of faith, let us get with our bibles and catch on our BIAY journey, make that appointment for confession, book that spiritual retreat, or make peace and mend the broken relationships.

Today is the day, now is the time.

‚ÄúAwake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead,
and Christ shall give you light.‚Äù Ep 5:14

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Israel's Cycle of Disobedience

[![Israel's Cycle of Disobedience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day089.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Rb2MsstSMO4 "Israel's Cycle of Disobedience")

##### Day 89 Israel‚Äôs cycle of Disobedience

If you give a pig a nice bath it would almost immediately go back to the slush and dirt. The Israelites seem to be going through a similar situation ‚Äì they seem to be getting better with each new Judge but go back to their sin as soon as the judge dies.

The root cause for this recurring failure was disobedience, the Lord gave them clear instruction to drive out the inhabitants of the promised land. However, the Israelites kept them to do bonded labor and even intermarried. They disobeyed God‚Äôs clear instruction, not to have a covenant with those people.

This disobedience cost the Israelites God‚Äôs favor, earlier the Lord had won victories for them, and now the Lord is not going forward with them in their battles.

We can learn something from this, we sometimes want to hold on to some pet sins of ours from the past. We want the goodness of the Lord, and we also want the pleasures of the world. We have divided hearts, we are neither hot nor cold. We want to mix and match ‚Äì we want to be blessed with everything and yet don‚Äôt want to pray. We want to be seen as good people and yet do not do kind things. We want to go to heaven, yet do not want to be holy. We want to be forgiven, yet do not forgive.

We got to be careful here, we need to break the cycle of Disobedience. The Lord has been patient with us and is slow to anger, we are given time to repent and mend our ways. Let us heed his calling least he spits up out of His mouth.

I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm‚Äîneither hot nor cold‚ÄîI am about to spit you out of my mouth. Rev 3:15-16

St Paul urges us to put off all the old habits and ways of life and to put on our new self, the new person who is renewed and striving to be holy, avoiding any pitfalls or staying in the state of grace and frequenting the sacraments.

You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. Ep 4:22-24

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Ruth and Boaz

[![Ruth and Boaz](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day090.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1bcri3WzaxM "Ruth and Boaz")

Fr. Mike highlights the life of Ruth, and what seems to be the first day of hope she's had in a long time. Sometimes it takes a long time to catch a glimmer of hope in the darkness of our lives, but Ruth reminds us that no matter what we've been through, God is always with us. Today's readings are Judges 4-5, Ruth 2, and Psalm 134.

##### Day 90 *Kindness - Boaz and Ruth - Women-O-Women*

We see kindness on display as we read about Boaz and Ruth. I think Fr Mike should say Women-O-Women instead of Man-O-Man, Ruth is such a good example to all the young girls in the world today. Ruth‚Äôs husband dies young and Ruth has a choice to find another husband/go back to her mother‚Äôs house or stay with her mother-in-law. Most of us would have done what Ruth‚Äôs sister-in-law did ‚Äì leave the mother-in-law and find go our own way. Ruth decides to stay with the Mother-in-Law Naomi and embrace her God and her people. I‚Äôm sure God was waiting for a day to bless Ruth, God causes Boaz to notice this poor young lady picking grain from the left-over harvest from the first in the ground.

Boaz can be a good example to all employers and team leads/managers ‚Äì instead of chasing her away -he shows her kindness.

Kindness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit.

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control Gal 5:22,23

One good way to self-examine is to check our thoughts and actions and see how kind we actually are.

Kindness is defined as ‚Äòthe quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate.‚Äô ‚Äì let us try to be more friendly, generous, and considerate of others, letting go of hurts, walking the extra mile, giving our coat to those who ask for our shirt, turning the other cheek to those who slap us/humiliate us.

The bible time and again calls us to be kind to each other.

‚ÄúBe kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.‚Äù Ep 4:32

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Gideon's Story

[![Gideon's Story](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day091.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RSnBpMdFtj4 "Gideon's Story")

##### Day 91 Losing track of our goal.

We read the story of Gideon, the story has a lot of heroic movements and signs and wonders.

We see that Gideon asks the correct questions to the angel.

13 Gideon answered him, ‚ÄúBut sir, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, ‚ÄòDid not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?‚Äô But now the Lord has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Midian.‚Äù Judeges 6:13

Then he asks for signs ‚Äì the first sign is for the food to be consumed and there was fire from the rock. There was the next sign about the dew falling on the fleece of the wool and the drying up of the same. The Lord answered him every time and even gave him strength like no other ‚Äì Gideon was a nobody and the Lord granted him victory over great kings.

However, the sad part of the story is Gideon was not successful in riding the Israelites of idol worship as he took the loot-gold and made it into a molten image which became another idol, and after his death, the Israelites went back to idol worship, in fact, this time they made a Baal of the covenant - Ba‚Ä≤al-be‚Ä≤rith their God - Baal in the image of Yahweh.

We need to be very careful to live out our whole life for the Lord. Sometimes we start strong and lose our goal by the end of our life. Let us learn a life lesson from Gideon, we should not end our lives like Gideon but like St Paul, who was able to say.

‚ÄúI have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith‚Äù 2 Tim 4:7

Let us hope and pray that our goal should always be to do the will of the Father.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 92 Jesus our Redeemer

The story of Ruth is lovely, the character that Boaz shows is impeccable. Boaz does not take advantage of Ruth, when she lies down at his feet at the Threshing floor, he even makes sure that her honor is kept ‚ÄúHe tells his servant let it not be known that she came here‚Äù He is the next in kin and there is someone before him, he offers the immediate next in kin the option to Redeem Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth ‚Äì but the offer was turned down. So, Boaz steps up and does what is needed, redeeming Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth. Boaz and Ruth marry, and they have a son named Obed. These good people become part of the lineage of Jesus. Obed is the father of Jesse, and the grandfather of David.

Even though Ruth is a Moabitess, the good example and love of her mother-in-law influenced Ruth to be of good character. The Lord blessed her and even included her in the lineage of Jesus.

We should learn from their example and be good witnesses ‚Äì genuine and true. Only a genuine love for the Lord can draw people to Christ, we will also become a path for others to find Christ, just as Ruth and Boaz become part of the lineage of Jesus.

Just like Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth, we are also in need of redemption. We have committed sin and are in bondage of sin ‚Äì we have no way to redeem ourselves with our own good deeds, and our debt to pay is very high. That is why we need Jesus, who is the first in kin ‚Äì the one who will redeem us and restore us to himself. He is our bridegroom, and we are His bride.

At the start of His ministry Jesus reads proclaims that He is the promise that Isiah spoke about.

‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free‚Äú Luke 4:18

Jesus our merciful redeemer - we ask that you help us in our weakness and we offer our lives to you, please redeem and save us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![Strengths and Weaknesses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day093.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jTp4hsgYYwE "Strengths and Weaknesses")

##### Day 93: Childless couples and IVF

We see the Miracle of another old couple being blessed with a child ‚Äì the parents of Samson. There are few examples in the bible ‚Äì where older parents are blessed with a child late in life - Abraham and Sarah, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and Boaz and Ruth ‚Äì fresh in our memory.

In our modern-day ‚Äì "instant culture", we see that parents who are childless get impatient and want to have a child at any cost. Now, what is wrong with parents wanting a child and demanding it as a right. The only thing wrong is that a child is a blessing from God. God is our creator and we are co-creators with Him, it was God who initially blessed human beings and said ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply‚Äù we need to remember that God is in control. But if God is for life and the parents want a child and the church is pro-life why would IVF which is life creating ‚Äì baby making ‚Äì not be accepted by the church.

The Church has many reasons for it ‚Äì it‚Äôs based on the moral law of God and His commandments.

The life of a child should always be within the context of the marital act, remember that God is present at all times in a marriage. However with IVF the process to collect the sperm and egg ‚Äì involves sinful methods and we all know that sin separates us from God. Along with the creation of a physical baby, each baby is given a soul ‚Äì there is absolutely no way the IVF process has a way to create a soul.

God in His goodness gives the baby a soul, just as God does in the cases of a child born due to rape or fornication. However, that does not mean that God approves of rape and fornication. Something to think about.

Also, IVF has cases where there are multiple embryos and a need for selective abortion.

IVF can be a sensitive topic and I am not an expert on the church‚Äôs teachings, just sharing my thoughts based on simple research.

‚ÄúI respect your opinion if it differs‚Äú

God should always be at the center of marriage, and we should be open to life and aware of His presence during the marital act. If you are a couple considering IVF, I would like you to prayerfully consider other options of adopting a deserving child or waiting on the Lord for a child, or dedicating your life more to God‚Äôs service.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Samson and Delilah

[![Samson and Delilah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day094.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-2XUUC1_Krk "Samson and Delilah")

##### Day94 Samson is ruled by his desires ‚Äì Lust is blinding

The most famous judge - Samson was blessed with great strength ‚Äì he slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. Although he had great physical strength, he had a great weakness his lust ‚Äì we can read how Samson was time and again going after non-Israeli women and harlots.

Samson is enslaved by his lust for the Harlot Delilah. The Philistines were willing to pay a lot of money to Delilah, to entice Samson and find out where his strength lies. I cannot believe how Samson kept trusting Delilah even though she tried to have him killed 3 times. However, her nagging got to him ‚Äì Samson wanted to go back to her every day, and her words ‚Äúthat he didn‚Äôt love her‚Äù got to him and he reveals the secret about his strength in the Nazirite vow ‚Äì where he does not shave his head. She let him down again by shaving his head, they captured and gouged out his eyes, and threw him in prison. It seems like a no-brainer, one would ask, couldn‚Äôt Samson a great judge appointed by God not see the trick of Delilah. He could not he was blinded by lust, which lead him to be permanently blind -as his eyes were gorged out.

Maybe it was better for him because he called out to God and God‚Äôs spirit returned to him. He was able to kill more Philistines by pulling down the pillars.

Even Jesus warns us about the lust of the eyes, let‚Äôs hear it in Jesus' words.

27 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. Mat 5

Let us hear Jesus‚Äô words and avoid the sin of lust of the eyes, as it blinds us. Even great people in the bible like Samson, King David, and evil people like Herod were all blinded by lust. Herod was so blind that he was lusting over his own daughter‚Äôs dance. Lust caused these characters to commit murder ‚Äì king David ordered Bathsheba‚Äôs husband to be murdered and Herod ordered the head of John the Baptist. Samson lost his mission to free the people from the Philistines. Lust can cause good men and women to do really bad things like rape, murder, fornication, etc.

A method to catch Bears is to soak a knife in blood and leave it out in the snow. The bear will find it and start licking the knife, keeping on licking the knife until its own tongue is cut. The bear goes into a frenzy and ends up licking its own blood and bleeds to death. This is the state of those who are trapped in habitual lust sins, they end up feeding on their own lustful appetites and will lose their soul.

The Lord is very merciful with those caught in traps of sin, He will free our shackles and redeem us. We can approach him who sits on the mercy seat, for he was tempted in every way possible. He does not condemn but wants to save.

15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Heb 4

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 95: Relativism brings Chaos

NOTE: THIS EPISODE IS PG-RATED

We see one of the lowest, most gruesome episodes of the Bible in Judges. This terrible state of lawlessness was due to the fact -

‚ÄúIn those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.‚Äù Judges 21:25

Gruesome stuff, feel overwhelmed to even summarize what happened. There was a Levite who had a concubine ‚Äì this in itself is wrong, then the concubine left the Levite and went back to her father's house. The Levite went to bring her back, however, her father prevented the Levite from leaving with his daughter(we do not know the back story -may be the Levite was ill-treating her).

They eventually left and went to the tribe of Benjamin. This is where the unthinkable happened, the evil men wanted to have relations with the Levites ‚Äì which is wrong again.

The Levite and his host acted cowardly - and pushed out the concubine. The gang of men abused her all night and she was found dead in the morning at the door. The Levite cuts up her body into pieces and sends them to all of Israel and every tribe goes up to fight against Benjamin ‚Äì which is another tribe. Now, these other tribes go into the city and kill all of the Benjaminite women. Which is also very shameful.

The whole episode is just wrong. It‚Äôs a state of Chaos!!!

The root cause of this is ‚ÄúRELATIVISM‚Äù ‚Äì every man did what is right in his own mind.

Sadly, relativism has crept into our lives today. Most people just want to do what they want. Relativism has crept into the faith circles as well. There are so many denominations that seem to interpret the bible differently and if someone is not in terms with the pastor, a new sub-division is born and a "new church" with the doctrine that they like.

Even within the catholic church ‚Äì relativism has crept in. There is a growing population that wants women priests and deacons, gay and lesbian marriages to be blessed, and many want IVF and contraception to be permitted by the catholic church. Also, some do not believe in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and some do not go to confession.

And the motto of everyone has become ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù ‚Äì meaning you live your life according to your thoughts and I will live mine. The problem here is that people are taking the place of God and setting their own standards and beliefs, this is the reason there is division in the church, families, and society.

We need to return to the one source of truth, which is Jesus Christ. We need to adhere to the magisterium of the church, whose head is Jesus Christ. No teaching of the catholic church would be against the Bible ‚Äì God‚Äôs holy word ‚Äì but we cannot lock God in a book and say the Bible is the authority ‚Äì even the bible does not claim that.

‚ÄúThe solution to relativism is authority‚Äù - Michael Eltham üòÄ

The authority of the catholic church was instituted by Jesus when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and the promise that what would be bound on earth will be bound in heaven. In the old testament, the spiritual leaders of Israel had that role where they would bind something into law and agree and disagree on matters. Today that role is given to the catholic church, we should be so glad that our faith, teaching, and doctrine have been authorized by Jesus himself and passed down from generation to generation through the hands of many saints.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 96 Failing to correct our children

The famous parenting proverb from the bible is

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prov 13:24

Like many things in the Bible this proverb is hyperbole, I don‚Äôt think God wants us to beat our kids with a rod.

What it really means is we need to take responsibility for our kids ‚Äì young or old, we cannot ignore their mistakes, we cannot just tell them they are wrong, what we have to do is insist, pray and hopefully get them to repent.

We see Eli trying to correct his sons ‚Äì they were having relations with the women who worked at the entrance of the tent of the meeting, this is similar to committing adultery in front of the blessed sacrament, these sons of Eli have no respect for the Lord.

I guess Eli told them but they didn‚Äôt listen, Eli was old and maybe not persistent with his parenting skills. We as parents need to learn from this, if not the Lord‚Äôs favor will not rest on our family. We need to have rules and enforce them, it is easy to give in to our kids and let them do what they want. But that is not our calling or duty as parents. I remember what my mom always told me

‚ÄúIf you bring a soul into this world, you are responsible for it‚Äù Lois Eltham.

##### Samuel's Prophecy

Fr. Mike zeroes in on Samuel's dramatic prophecy and the tragic moment when the Philistines capture of the Ark of God. We learn that God is mighty and holds his people to a high standard. Today we read 1 Samuel 3-5 and Psalm 150.

[![Samuel's Prophecy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day097.jpg)](https://youtu.be/M7TUDSy6jVs "Samuel's Prophecy")

##### Day 97 Hearing the voice of God

As we read Samuel‚Äôs story, we cannot help but dwell on his calling.

It was a time of spiritual dryness

‚Äò‚Äô In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.‚Äù 1 Sam 3:1

Samuel didn‚Äôt know who was speaking for the first 3 times, with Eli‚Äôs guidance he was able to know it was the Lord that was speaking.

The world seems to be in the same state as at that time (there were not many visions or messages from God). We meet a lot of people these days who are unable to connect with God, the noise and craziness of this world seem to be blocking out the voice of God. People are busy with so many things, especially their cell phones.

The is a new phobia/fear NOMOPHOBIA or NO MObile PHone PhoBIA is used to describe a psychological condition when people have a fear of being detached from mobile phone connectivity.

We feel the need to be connected to people - family and friends and the internet and need all the news in a flash. Sadly, we have lost the longing to hear God‚Äôs voice.

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:John 10:27

We have failed to create an environment where we can quiet our hearts and listen to the Lord, be moved by the prompting of the Holy Spirit. We need to spend quiet time in prayer and listen to what God is speaking to us.

If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.Gal 5:25

We need to have a listening heart and constantly ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in literally everything we do. There is no right or wrong way to listen to God‚Äôs voice, some experience it while reading the bible ‚Äì where some verses catch their attention, some experience it while waiting on the Lord in quiet adoration, some experience guidance by means of feeling peace in decisions, some get help from prayer patterns and counselors, some experience God‚Äôs guidance in the Gifts of the Holy Spirit like visions, gift of knowledge and wisdom. The method is always between you and God ‚Äì but the important thing is to make time and the right environment for God to speak to us.

The Bible in a year program has been such a blessing for us to hear God‚Äôs voice through scriptures. God bless #FrMike for being the voice that reads us God‚Äôs precious word every day of the year.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Israel Asks for a King

[![Israel Asks for a King](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day098.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fhdlWqIQ-Fo "Israel Asks for a King")

##### Day 98 My will be done, my kingdom come

We pray the Our Father every day, maybe several times a day even. The 'Our father' Jesus taught us has ‚ÄúThy Kingdom come thy will be done‚Äù however we sometimes tend to do our own will instead of the will of God.
We have been studying the OT and the journey the Israelites made from Egypt to the Promised land, they had no king ‚Äì the Lord was their King, He led them out of slavery and defeated Egypt and every nation that came Israelites' way, nations far stronger than themselves.
The Lord gave them many Judges and looks like the sons of the Judges keep messing up time and again ‚Äì we saw Eli‚Äôs sons messed up a few chapters ago and the "ark of the covenant " was taken away. Now it's Samuel‚Äôs sons - they are not judging properly taking bribes and are corrupt. The people are tired of it and want a King like the other nations in the world.
The Lord is the best King, the other nations could not even hold on to the ark of the covenant they had to gracefully send it back. All the nations around knew the power of God, but the people of Israel ask for a king.
They are focusing on the world and asking God to do what they want. ‚ÄúMy will be done, my kingdom come‚Äù. They say ‚Äì other nations have a king, give us a king. They are literally asking for a replacement of God.
This could be the case with us as well, we look at the different things people have, and people do and ask the Lord ‚Äì I want it. We sometimes look at our lives and compare them to friends and others and complain that ‚Äúthey are richer‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe is healthier‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe is more beautiful than me‚Äù, and ‚Äúour neighbor's lawn is greener‚Äù. Let us seek God‚Äôs will in everything ‚Äì just like Jesus our thoughts should be
‚ÄúMy food,‚Äù said Jesus, ‚Äúis to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. John 4:34
Even when things get tough, we should persist through it. Pray as Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane - in sweat and blood.
My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will‚Äù Mat 26:39
We can pray for anything as we have a loving Father, however, if it's God‚Äôs will that we suffer or face difficulties, so be it ‚Äì let us press on and keep the faith. May our prayer be, Lord ‚ÄúThy will be done and Thy kingdom come‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Word Became Flesh

[![The Word Became Flesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day099.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ksIC_YsVasA "The Word Became Flesh")

##### Day 99 ‚ÄúWord became flesh‚Äù, ‚ÄúCanna symbol for resurrection‚Äù, ‚ÄúBorn again ‚Äì the right way‚Äù

WORD BECAME FLESH

Jesus has been around from the beginning ‚Äì that is even before the beginning of the world. Jesus is God ‚Äì He was with the Father and the Holy Spirit during the creation
‚ÄúLet us make mankind‚Äù Gen 1:26.
The Lord has been guiding the people of Israel through generations, God has been speaking His words ‚Äì words of love, kindness, instruction, commandments. The people are unable to perceive what God is truly like ‚Äì they are not able to related to words. That is why He send Jesus the
‚ÄúWord became flesh ‚Äú - God living among his people ‚Äì ‚ÄúEmmanuel ‚Äì God with us‚Äù
We have Jesus healing, feeding, blessing, speaking words of comfort, giving instruction, uplifting the neglected, the outcast, the widow and the orphan, the prostitute, and the tax collector. Jesus is proclaiming that
‚ÄúAll are welcome‚Äù
He is the living word of God ‚Äì Word made flesh. He proves His love for us ‚Äì love that is greater than any other love ‚Äì He dies for us ‚Äì while we were yet sinners.
CANNA IS A SYMBOL OF HIS RESURRECTION
First off we learn that we have a Mother who intercedes for us, she was concerned when the wine ran out, she has been given to us at the cross
‚ÄúBehold your mother‚Äù
so rest assured of her watchfulness and intercession in our lives. This was an earthly sign of her heavenly role in bringing our needs to her son.
The wedding at Canna was the first miracle that Jesus performed, it is very significant as it symbolizes His resurrection. The very first line gives us a big hint
‚ÄúOn the third day there was a marriage at Canna in Galilee‚Äù John 2:1
Let‚Äôs break it down
‚Äì we are all familiar with the third day Jesus rose on the third day - we are all familiar with the wedding feast of the bridegroom (Jesus) and the church (his bride)
‚Äì The location ‚Äì Galilee is key ‚Äì this is where Jesus meets all the disciples after the resurrection ‚Äì
(Mark 16 ‚ÄúBut go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him as he told you‚Äù)
Jesus here is turning water into wine ‚Äì symbolic for changing the water ‚Äì OT rituals into the gift of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. Water can be symbolized as an earthly or human effort of following the law and Spirit can be symbolized as heavenly ‚Äì Led by the Spirit we are able to live a holy life. Also symbolic of the great sacrifice of the lamb ‚Äì Jesus Christ is the lamb ‚Äì Wine changes to Blood ‚Äì which takes away the sin of the world.
BORN AGAIN
Unlike the common definition of born again ‚Äì ‚ÄúBelieve in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved‚Äù
Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again,
‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.‚Äù John 3:5
Water & Spirit
We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.
2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again ‚Äì we have the theme of water and Spirit.
3. We see the Israelites crossing the red sea (water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.
   Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.
4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land
5. Jesus was baptized ‚Äì in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.
6. So you are being saved by BAPTISM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)
7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)
8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession
9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus' Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 99 - George Vysamparambil

John 2:1 the third day: Chronologically this refers to the third day since Jesus' encounter with Nathanael (1:43-51). Theologically, it has 2 levels of significance

1. The third day is actually the 7th day of Jesus' opening week of ministry. The evangelist hints at this when he delineates the successive days in 1:29, 35, 43 and 2:1 implying that the creation fashioned in 7 days (Gen 1:1-2:3) is being transformed and renewed through Jesus ( 2 Cor 5:17, Rev 21:1-5)

2. Jesus manifests his glory on the 3rd day at Cana 2:11 just as he reveals his glory by rising on the 3rd day after his death ( 1 Cor 15:4)

2:4 - woman - Although it might offend the standards of modern etiquette , this was a title of respect and endearment in antiquity (4:21, 8:10, 20:13). Woman is used to refer to Gen 3:15. Genesis 3 is the reverse image of the Cana episode . As Eve prompted Adam to defy the Lord and drag the human family into sin, so Mary (New Eve) prompts the new Adam ( Jesus) to initiate his mission of salvation

2:6 - 6 stone jars: The purpose of these water jars is outlined in Num 19:11-22 which stipulates that any Israelite defiled by contact with the dead must be purified with water on the 3rd day, then again on the 7th day. Curiously the Cana miracle takes place on the 3rd day which according to John's chronology is also the 7th day. The 1st sign performed by Jesus (water into wine) recalls the first sign performed by Moses ( the first plague, water into blood Ex 7:19) . Note that wine is called the blood of grapes in Hebrew poetry ( Gen 49:11, Deut 32:14). 6 water jars refers to the OT rituals which cleans a person from outside and cannot save a man fully. Jesus changing water into wine refers to the New testament which cleans a person from inside and fully saves a person. Jesus changes water into wine and then later on changes wine into his blood. By consuming his body and blood, we are being fully saved. 6 is an incomplete number whereas 7 is complete according to Hebrew numerology. There are 6 water jars which is incomplete just like our life. But when Jesus changes water into wine, he becomes the 7th jar just like our life which becomes complete with Jesus.

The wedding of Adam and Eve takes place on the 7th day just like the wedding at Cana which takes on the 3rd day which is also the 7th day since 4 days have passed in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, there is no mention of the bride and bridegroom, it signifies the Wedding of the Lamb. Jesus is the Bridegroom and Mother Mary is the bride (representative of the Church).

##### Day 100 The Eucharist ‚Äì True presence not symbolic

We read about Jesus meeting a Samaritan woman at the well. Whenever there is a scene in the OT where a man meets a woman at the well‚Äì its symbolic of the proposal for marriage(Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel and Moses and Ziphora) ‚Äì also note that the Bible states that they meet at Jacob‚Äôs well ‚Äì is possibly the well where Jacob met Rebekah. That is why the disciples were shocked to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman ‚Äì however, they did not want to ask him anything (they must have been hoping Jesus wasn‚Äôt thinking of marrying a Samaritan woman).

If you think of it Jesus was actually proposing marriage - the Samaritan women represent us ‚Äì ‚Äúfallen humankind‚Äù. We have tried everything but have no fulfillment ‚Äì she married 5 men and was living with the sixth ‚Äì we have tried to be fulfilled by everything that the 5 senses offer ‚Äì but still are not satisfied. Jesus promised her ‚Äúliving waters‚Äù ‚Äì the Holy Spirit that will become in her a wellspring of salvation. She and we will never be thirsty again.

In order to have this life of fulness ‚Äì Jesus gives us a method, a means to Heavenly food and drink ‚Äì He gives us Himself ‚Äì Jesus is the new Manna ‚Äì the bread that came down from heaven.

Jesus is taking the promise forward ‚Äì the promise He made to the Samaritan women and to us. He says we will never hunger or never thirst if we eat His body and drink His blood.

35 Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6

Jesus repeats the importance of the Eucharist 5 times in the discourse. Many people dismiss this teaching and say that Jesus is just referring to reading His word ‚Äì Jesus is very clear here about eating and drinking ‚Äì he does not mean it symbolically or as a metaphor ‚Äì because he repeated it 5 times ‚Äì clarifying it each time they murmured ‚Äì they murmured about who He was ‚Äì ‚Äúwe know his father Joseph and his mother Mary ‚Äì how can he say I came from heaven‚Äù

They murmured about eating flesh and drinking blood ‚Äì because it was forbidden according to the Jewish custom.

Each time Jesus replied with strong words ‚Äì the Greek captures it better than the English translation ‚Äì the Greek word used for ‚Äòflesh‚Äô ‚Äì denotes real physical flesh or soft tissue and the word for eat ‚Äì translates to ‚Äògnaw‚Äô and ‚Äòmunch‚Äô ‚Äì its could be understood as ‚Äúmasticating the flesh‚Äù. Most of Jesus' disciples and followers left at this teaching ‚Äì this is the only time they left due to doctrinal issues.

Jesus never told them ‚Äì STOP ‚Äì I‚Äôm just speaking symbolically. Many are murmuring even today, many are leaving the faith and many are Leaving the catholic church over this teaching. Remember Jesus told us to remember Him by eating His body and drinking blood - in the last supper.

The Eucharist is the true body and blood of Jesus. Of course, it is hard to eat real flesh and real blood and it is impossible for us to live if God reveals Himself in full glory to us. That is why Jesus has pity on us and is present in the form of humble bread and wine.

The term is Transubstantiation - the change by which the substance (though not the appearance) of the bread and wine in the Eucharist becomes Christ‚Äôs real presence‚Äîthat is, his body and blood.

We can thank a doctor of the Church ‚Äì a great Theologian ‚Äì Thomas Aquinas for this. A lot of time and space needs to be dedicated to understanding it.

As far as the argument about ‚ÄòIt is the Spirit that gives life; the flesh is of no avail‚Äô ‚Äì Jesus is referring to the human flesh or weakness ‚Äì earlier he said eat my flesh and in this verse, he says the flesh is of no avail. If Jesus said 5 times that His flesh brings life ‚Äì why would he say flesh is of no avail, he means our human nature/flesh.

Let these words that Jesus said stay in our thoughts. Unless we eat His body and drink His blood we have no life in us. When Jesus says truly truly ‚Äì He really means it.

‚ÄúSo Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúVery truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.‚Äù John 6:53

Even though it may not be fully clear to you today or if you have doubts or if you are murmuring about it ‚Äì pray as Peter prayed.

‚ÄúLord where can we go for you have the words of eternal life.‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Signs and Wonders

[![Signs and Wonders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day101.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QDP4X_c8kcQ "Signs and Wonders")

##### Day 101 Jesus and His Mercy for the women caught in adultery

As we read the story of the women caught in adultery we can‚Äôt help but awe at the Mercy of God. First off Jesus sees deeper, He knows our hearts. He knew the hidden motive of the Pharisees, who wanted to actually trap Jesus.
First of all, it is not easy to catch someone in the act of adultery, people seek privacy for the marital act ‚Äì so much more for adultery. So for the Pharisees to find the women in the act would actually mean they have been looking to catch them and they did not find them by accident.
The second question is ‚Äúwhere is the man?‚Äù, the law was to stone both of them, not just the women. Maybe the elders were trying to frame this poor woman or even if they actually caught her in the act ‚Äì they are being very partial to the man.
While the elders stand with raised stones and with wrath in their hearts, looking down on the woman. Jesus on the other hand bends down and writes on the sand, Jesus humbles himself to the level of the woman and looks at her with Mercy ‚Äì does not look down on her.
As the men press on for Jesus to condemn and stone her, Jesus writes on the dust ‚Äì the word of God does not specify what He wrote ‚Äì however there are some assumptions we can make

1. At creation we know what happened when God touched dust and breathed on it ‚Äì "man was created".
   7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.Gen 2: 7
   Here Jesus is God touching dust again ‚Äì He is creating a new opportunity for the women - a brand new life ‚Äì He makes everything new ‚Äì wipes her slate clean and gives her a new chance at life.
2. The other time God‚Äôs finger touched the earth, He write laws on the stone tablets. Jesus - God is writing again - maybe the laws ‚Äì maybe even writing the new law ‚Äì the old law said if you commit adultery ‚Äì the new law Jesus gave is ‚Äúeven if you look at a woman with lust you have committed adultery in your heart‚Äù so maybe the elder who caught the women in the act ‚Äì lusted over her. They could not throw a stone anymore as they would need to be stoned as well.
   MY DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ‚Äì BE ENCOURAGED AND NOT DISCOURAGED ‚Äì ‚ÄúGOD IS MERCIFUL‚Äù.
   He came not to condemn but to save. He came to forgive us or not to judge us like a merciless judge. He is a Merciful Judge that has compassion for broken creatures like us.
   May we also be like Jesus, quick to forgive and slow to judge and condemn.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 101 - George Vysamparambil

8:8 wrote ....on the ground: What Jesus inscribed in the dirt is unknown but probably symbolic. The gesture may recall Jer 17:13, a warning that those who forsake the Lord "shall be written in the earth" because they have rejected the "fountain of living water". The Pharisees fall into this category for rejecting Jesus, who has just been identified as the source of "living water" (7:38). Christ, who twice bends down to write on the ground, teaches us to bend low in humility to examine ourselves both before and after addressing the faults of our neighbour. If his example becomes our pratice, we will avoid as he did the extremes of being unjust and unmerciful toward others

##### Day 102: The Good Shepherd

The promise of the Good Shepherd from the OT in Psalm 23 ‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want‚Äù is fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus proclaims that in today‚Äôs Gospel

‚ÄúI am the good shepherd ‚Äì the one who lays down His life for the sheep‚Äù. John 10:11

The good shepherd cares for the sheep ‚Äì He feeds them in green pastures, by quiet waters.

He leads them on the right path, protects them in the dark valley.

The shepherd also corrects and comforts the sheep with His rod and staff.

When a sheep goes astray ‚Äì He goes in search of the sheep ‚Äì and finds it and carries it back home. He restores their soul ‚Äì forgives their sins - washes them in His blood and makes them whole.

There is rejoicing in heaven over every sheep that is found ‚Äì He anoints our head with oil, prepares a banquet, our cup is overflowing, surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life, and on the day we pass from this world to the next ‚Äì we will go in though Him - for He said

‚ÄúI am the door of the sheep, if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture‚Äù John 10: 9

We have to teach our hearts and mind to listen to Him and follow Him. We also should be aware of the voice of the evil one ‚Äì who only wants to rob, steal, and destroy us. We should set time for silent listening every day and also be aware of the promptings and the nudges of the Holy Spirit throughout the day.

God wants us to give us life in abundance and he also tells us that there are many who need to come into the flock. Everyone needs to hear His voice in prayer and hear Him as we read the Bible. We need to experience the life-giving word of God. Just as Lazarus came to life just by hearing Jesus‚Äôs voice, we need to come alive in many areas of our life as we hear God‚Äôs voice spoken to us.

All we need to do is pay attention to His voice and stay close to Him, He will provide, protect, guide, and lead us to the safe bosom of Abba Father.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Judas' Secrecy

[![Judas' Secrecy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day103.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kT8pVB6I4GE "Judas' Secrecy")

##### Day 103: ‚ÄúWashing of the feet ‚Äì anointing, priesthood, and service‚Äù ‚ÄúAbiding in God‚Äù

It is indeed a moving scene; a Rabbi or teacher washes the feet of the disciples. One important thing that we may miss is the washing of the feet was an important part of the ordination of the priest in the OT.

‚ÄúThen you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water, and put upon Aaron the holy garments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest‚Äù (Exod. 40:12-13).

The washing of the feet is also a great call to service for every Christian. We are not called to be served but to serve ‚Äì following the example Jesus set for us - we need to wash each other‚Äôs feet. Just as the title of the pope is Servant of Servants. We are called to be servant leaders ‚Äì not Lording it over ‚Äì but serving with Love and Humility ‚Äì putting the interest of others first.

To be able to serve, we would need to be grounded and connected to the Vine. On our own it is impossible if a branch decides to separate from the Vine ‚Äì it withers and dries up. In the same way, if we take on Service as something we do with all the resources we have, we will fall short of the goal, we will dry up and exhaust.

We need to receive our nourishment from the Vine from Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúbody, blood, soul and divinity‚Äù in the Holy Eucharist we receive. Just as the branch receives sap from the root, we need to receive our spiritual food from Jesus the source of everything good.

St Mother Theresa of Calcutta would spend 1 hour in holy adoration every day before she went out to serve the poor. If she had a very busy day, she would spend 2 hours before going out ‚Äì she believed that she needed more nourishment before she could do more.

May the Lord be our nourishment in the Eucharist ‚Äì ‚Äúthe source and summit of the Christian life.‚Äù CCC 1324

##### Day 104 This is the time of the Holy Spirit

In the Old Testament all focus was on the God the Father ‚Äì ‚ÄúAbba‚Äù, during the earthly life of Jesus ‚Äì all focus was on Jesus. Now it‚Äôs the time of the Holy Spirit, that is why we hear Jesus saying the words

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. John 61:7

Now when I say, ‚Äúthis is the time of the Holy Spirit‚Äù I do not mean that the Father and the son are forgotten. The Father, Son, and Spirit are so united ‚Äì that they are always working together and in perfect union. What it means is that in the Old Testament only a few were anointed and experienced the Holy Spirit, only the prophets, Kings. However, when Jesus dies and rises to Heaven ‚Äì He can send the Holy Spirit to everyone ‚Äì the Spirit will empower us to do the works Jesus did and even greater works.

We all know what happened at Pentecost and we read about the working of the Holy Spirit in the acts of the Apostles. The apostles spoke of the Holy Spirit as being present with them as a real person. Reading the below verse reflects it.

For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials: Acts 15:28

It‚Äôs like saying Tom and Harry felt good about buying a property and they did. The Holy Spirit was real and a person who they could talk to and listen to.

That is why St Paul would give blessings like ‚Äúfellowship of the Holy Spirit‚Äù

14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. 2 Cor 13:14

The Holy Spirit has been forgotten or limited to an image of a dove or fire. But the Holy Spirit is a person, the third person of the Holy Trinity.

The Holy Spirit is gentle and not imposing if we welcome the Holy Spirit into our lives ‚Äì we will become children of God.

For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. Rom 8:14

The Holy Spirit pours God‚Äôs love into our hearts.

God‚Äôs love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. Rom 5:5

Thank God for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, I was introduced to the Holy Spirit. Earlier I thought it was just a dove, but now the Holy Spirit is my Advocate, Councilor, comforter, guide, helper, Convicter of Sin, Intercessor, Teacher, revealer of truth and constant companion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 105 ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù

In final moments of Jesus‚Äôs crucifixion, He says these words ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù just before the final words ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù. Many saints have meditated on these last words of Jesus and we should to. what does Jesus thirst for? Is it for souls?
St Mother Teresa spent her whole live trying to comfort Jesus who thirsts for us.
"I thirst" is something much deeper than Jesus just saying "I love you." Until you know deep inside that Jesus thirsts for you - you can't begin to know who He wants to be for you. Or who He wants you to be for Him. The heart and soul of \[Missionaries of Charity\] is only this - the thirst of Jesus' Heart, hidden in the poor. ... "I thirst" and "You did it to me" - remember always to connect the two. - St Mother Teresa
Mother Teresa spent a whole life serving and her whole congregation are now serving the poor, they see Jesus in the poor and the hungry, those who thirst and those who hunger ‚Äì are feed.
St Faustina united her suffering with the Passion of Christ in order that sinful souls are given the strength to repent.
During Holy Mass, I saw the Lord Jesus nailed upon the cross amidst great torments. A soft moan issued from His Heart. After some time, He said: I thirst. i thirst for the salvation of souls. Help Me, My daughter, to save souls. Join your sufferings to My Passion and offer them to the heavenly Father for sinners (Diary, 1032). - Saint Faustina.
We need to do two things to satisfy the thirst of Jesus.
Repent of our sins and welcome Jesus into our hearts.
Pray for the world and for sinners to repent.
Jesus thirst for us, He thirst for our time, He thirst for our will, He thirsts also to comfort us, to give us rest, He thirsts to come into our hearts and dine with us.
20 Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me. Rev 3:20
My dear brothers and sisters, do not harden your hearts, pray and welcome Jesus into you lives. He thirsts to come into your hearts and your lives. He thirsts for you to receive Him at Mass, so he can enter you and fill you with love and wholeness.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Saul Is Chosen

[![Saul Is Chosen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day106.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8XfBeZFhNnE "Saul Is Chosen")

##### Day 106 Do not only go with "Outwardly appearances" ‚Äì do not be fooled

Over the generations, they have been many sayings like ‚ÄúAll that glitters is not gold‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo not judge the book by the cover‚Äù do you remember any such saying/quotes?
In today‚Äôs readings, we read the story of Saul, on the outward, he seemed like the perfect candidate to be the first King of Israel.
There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; he stood head and shoulders above everyone else. 1 Sam 9:2
Outwardly he was the most handsome man in all of Israel, the tallest and strongest. However inwardly he was fearful and insecure, looking at his own strengths and weaknesses.
‚ÄúAm I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?‚Äù 1 Sam 21
He questions his ability, his background, his family, from where he comes. We all will remember that the Benjaminite tribe was the tribe that was attached to all the other tribes of Israel ‚Äì because the Benjaminite tribe raped the concubine of the priest, the priest cut her body into pieces and send it to all the tribes. All the tribes attached Benjaminite tribe and killed all the women there. Then the Benjaminites were kidnapping virgins from other tribes to marry them as there were no women left in their tribe.
Even after Saul was anointed when they were going to install him as King, he was hiding in the luggage.
‚ÄúBehold, he has hidden himself among the baggage‚Äù 1 Sam 10: 22
Even in the proverb that we read today we are reminded to not be attracted to loose women.
‚ÄúFor the lips of loose women drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.‚Äù Prov 5:4
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Prov 31:30
We can expand this warning from just being about loose women to anything that seems attractive to us. The lust of the eyes, where we lust over things of the world, lust for people, things, experiences, whatever we seem to be attracted to - that reduces our love for God.
Another scripture that emphasizes this is
Do not let your adorning be external‚Äîthe braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear‚Äî but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. 1 Pet 3:3-4
We are called to look at the person's heart and not just the outward appearance. Look at the internal beauty, the beauty of the soul.
In everything, we need to go after things that are good, pleasing, and truly good.
8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Phil 4:8
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Samuel's Speech

[![Samuel's Speech](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day107.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vBMNpTla9zM "Samuel's Speech")

##### Day 107 God allows us to have our way, if we insist ‚Äì His permissible will

The Lord has been very patient with the Israelites, brought them out of slavery, and defeated the Egyptians and every kingdom/people who came in their way to the promised land. Yet the stiff-necked people say, ‚ÄúGive us a king‚Äù, God warns them of the difficulties they would face under the king‚Äôs rule. The people just won‚Äôt have it, they want a king. They want to replace God‚Äôs direct guidance with a human king. Remember the Lord was their King ‚Äì He was leading and governing them ‚Äì through the prophets Moses, Joshua, and the many judges.
God said so be it, if these people are so insistent ‚Äì let us give them a king.
However, this is not God‚Äôs perfect will for Israel but a permissible will. When Israel choose not to pick God‚Äôs perfect will - God did not abandon them, He give them a second chance. He says here through Samuel.
14 If you will fear the Lord and serve him and hearken to his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God, it will be well; 1 Sam 12:14
So it is with us, that God has plans for our lives. He loves us and knows everything about us, when we sit down and when we rise up when we come in and go out, all our days are in His hand. God has called us and appointed us to do certain things on earth.
We sometimes are unaware of how to discern God‚Äôs voice(Samuel did not know who was calling him in the temple), sometimes caught up in sin, sometimes know what God whats of us but just do not have the willpower to do it.
For Example, God has a plan for a young man Joe to become a priest. Joe loves to pray and go to church regularly, Joe even feels drawn to the priesthood. However Joe has bad friends, they constantly take him away from Church. He eventually ends up marrying one of his friends. Joe and his wife were never meant to be together, they end up fighting and are on the verge of divorce.
Joe turns back to God, what would God do?
If you answered, ‚ÄúGod would give them a second chance‚Äù ‚Äì you are right ‚Äì God would help Joe and his wife by either leading them to the right marriage counselor or God would supernaturally give them more love and patience. God's ways are not our ways. After Joe‚Äôs marriage is restored, God would possibly lead Joe into lay ministry ‚Äì so Joe will be able to serve God. Of course, not at the capacity, God wanted for Joe, but at a capacity, Joe was able to. The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Our God is a God of second chances, just because we did not do what God had in store for us ‚Äì He will never leave us. In fact, He will leave the 99 good sheep and come in search of us.
God eventually did give us a king who was Human. It was Jesus ‚Äì fully human and fully God. God‚Äôs plan of being our king and our demand to have a human king was merged into Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 107

In today's study we see the lsraelites had no Leader and frequently fell prey to other nations because of their failure to trust and obey their God. They want to replace God's guidance with a king.
In the beginning, Saul as an appointed king, was one of humility and was able to rule God's people. He was to administer the Lord's Covenant. The Prophet Samuel was to give Spiritual Counsel as well as Divine lnstructions.
A strong warning was given to the people and Samuel concluded encouraging them that God would not forsake His people and Samuel would not cease to pray for them.
The Psalm, a betrayal, hurts the most. Our Lord faced the same heartbreak when Judas betrayed Him.

##### Saul's Vanity

[![Saul's Vanity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day108.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VtbaJ_3lXrw "Saul's Vanity")

##### Day 108 - Jenita

When you do the right thing in life... No matter what the law or situation is.. It will turn favorable to you. When the people of Israel knew they had to fight they hid themselves. But Jonathan and his armor bearer, stood up and fought for the people and that brave act of his saved his life from his father.
How many of us have the mind to stand up and do something about a complex situation?

Saul makes a rash vow, which puts his son's life in jeopardy. Sometimes we land up making such rash vows without thinking through the consequences of the decisions we make. We must ensure we never make decisions out of emotions but only after a good thought process about the entire situation.

Let us learn to be like Jonathan who is willing to fight the battle no one was willing to fight.

##### Day 108 Saul is ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù and ‚Äútoo rash‚Äù for his own good

Let us put ourselves in the shoes or sandals(hehe) of an Israelite ‚Äì We have demanded a King and we now have an anointed King Saul. We are not getting ready for battle, look at your weapons ‚Äì you have no sword, no armor just your farm tools. You are a farmer and are used to cultivating the land ‚Äì you are now asked to bring those farming tools and fight the Philistine army. The army has big, strong, strapping giant-like warriors. The army is so huge it‚Äôs like sand on the seashore.
What would you do? Would you fight or hide in a hole?
Now you have a prophet Samuel who is supposed to come and offer sacrifice and ask for God‚Äôs favor ‚Äì for it was the Lord who won all the previous battles for you. Samuel does not show up, you get scared and scatter.
Now for a second Imagine you are Saul the king who sees his weak peasant army hiding, what would you do??
Saul cannot handle it ‚Äì he Jumps the gun. He disobeys God, he offers the sacrifice himself. Saul seems to be acting out of fear.
Samuel comes and announces that Saul‚Äôs reign is over, he will not rule forever. That his son Jonathan will not be the next King.
I feel sad for Jonathan, he is a hero, a fearless warrior. Now there are only two swords in all of Isreal ‚Äì Saul has one ‚Äì too scared to use it, I guess. Johnathan has the other sword - He has faith, he has courage, He has a heart of a warrior, knowing that if God is for us who can be against us.
Johnathan jumps into action ‚Äì attacks and kills 20 men, this causes chaos and the whole army is overturned. God uses the faith of Johnathan to defeat a huge army of great warriors.
Saul in his rash ‚Äì swears an oath ‚Äì that no one should eat the honey on the ground, Johnathon unknowing of the oath eats it. Johnathan‚Äôs eyes are brightened, but Saul won‚Äôt have it ‚Äì he wants to kill his own son, the warrior son who won him the battle. The people are tired of Saul‚Äôs craziness, they ransom Johnathan.
We can learn not to operate out of fear, not to act in haste, don‚Äôt make rash decisions. Allow God to act, and when you feel inspired ‚Äì throw yourself out there ‚Äì God will take care of you as he did for Johnathan. God is looking at your hearts, he wants leaders to be after His own heart. God will fight for us if we are willing to die for Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### A Heart of Obedience

[![A Heart of Obedience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day109.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tXiEIfY6Mxo "A Heart of Obedience")

##### Day 109 Obedience is greater than sacrifice

We see how Saul is messing up again and again - doing what He likes. He orders that they keep the good stuff from the spoil, even though the Lord warned against it. Saul keeps all of the cattle and even offers some of them to the Lord.
Samuel is furious about it, He asks Saul this very important question.
‚ÄúHas the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obedience to the voice of the Lord? Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.
For rebellion is no less a sin than divination, and stubbornness is like iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has also rejected you from being king.‚Äù 1 Sam 15:22
The reason why Saul is rejected is that He just does not want to listen to God‚Äôs instructions. Disobedient, rebellious, and stubborn he is rejecting God‚Äôs word.
Remember Adam and Even got thrown out of Eden because of their disobedience, they just thought that they knew better than God.
Saul looked at the spoil ‚Äì it was pleasing to the eye, good for the body, so He consumed it and even offered it to God.
Let us learn not to be disobedient, rebellious, and stubborn ‚Äì let us listen to God‚Äôs word and act on it. Let us build our lives according to God‚Äôs instruction from His word. God does not look at the outward appearance, He looks at the heart. God does not want our sacrifices and our charity, He wants us, God wants our hearts.
That is why God chose David and rejected his elder brothers who were strong and good-looking like Saul. God looked at David‚Äôs heart and knew that David had it in him to slay the giant, David had a heart that was attuned to the worship of God.
David had praise on his lips and used his talent (music) to glorify God.
We need to cultivate the habit of listening to and singing/playing spiritual music, we see the power it has in driving out evil spirits from Saul.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### David and Goliath

[![David and Goliath](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day110.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ehmV56hG3C0 "David and Goliath")

##### Day 110 - Jenita

David's intention to fight Goliath was not for his ego or pride but because of the insults of Goliath against God. He wanted to fight for the glory of God.

How many of us fight our battles for our own ego.. How many unnecessary battles have we fought to feed our ego.

When we work for the glory of God.. Everything will fall in place such that we will be able to defeat our giants with much ease.

##### Day 110 Facing giants

The story of David slaying Goliath is almost every kid‚Äôs favorite Bible story. Not just the kids, everyone loves a story where the underdog defeats the champion ‚Äì there are many famous movies/books with this concept.
Goliath was terrorizing Saul's army for 40 days(40 refers to a long time). No one from the army was willing to fight the giant. All of David‚Äôs strong brothers were in the army, but none of them were willing to take on the Giant.
David comes in and cannot digest the fact that his brothers and all of the Israelites are so afraid. I can almost hear him yell -
For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?‚Äù 1 Sam 17:26
The thing that inspired David to fight was that the Lord‚Äôs name was being humiliated and that no one was doing anything about it.
David did not keep quiet, he started talking and trying to get some Israelites fired up to fight Goliath. David‚Äôs words reached Saul, now we know that Saul is fearful and keep hiring strong men to protect him.
I can‚Äôt imagine how David spoke the below words to King Saul(stronger and taller) and his band of hired strong men.
‚ÄúLet no one‚Äôs heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.‚Äù 1 Sam 17:32
David relies on God, the God who protected him against the wild lion and bears. David was self-training when he was doing his assigned task of caring for the sheep. David here is a pre-figuration of Jesus ‚Äì the good shepherd who did not fear death.
David knows for a fact that the Lord who protected him against the wild animals will protect him against Goliath.
Saul out of fear ‚Äì tries to put on his own armor on David ‚Äì but doesn‚Äôt fit. David is fearless, he picks up 5 smooth stones and a sling. Even if David has to go with just his bare hands he would have won, because David was not relying on his own ability but on the Lord.
‚ÄúYou come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 1 Sam 17:45
David did not go only with his own strength; He had the Lord on his side. As David swung that pebble ‚Äì it was the Lord‚Äôs mighty hand that guided it with so much force that Goliath a might warrior fell to the ground.
When we face giants in our lives, giants of sickness, sin, addictions, bad relationships, financial situations, spiritual darkness, we have to say those words of David ‚Äì ‚ÄúI come in the name of the Lord‚Äù and even if we have faith as small as a mustard seed, the mountains will move, the giants will fall. Even if the giants have been jeering at us for a long time. We will be victorious, not by our strength but by the Lord.
Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,‚Äô saith the Lord of hosts. Zechariah 4:6
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 110: Sheela

Once again Saul achieves victory by relying on himself, the challenge of a more than nine-foot-tall Giant, instead of GOD.
The success of David was not his own. David put his faith in God. God was the source of David's accomplishment.
The Psalmist felt that no good and faithful individual existed in his world. God is not watching us with grade book in hand, to pass or fail us. When testing comes we become aware and like the Psalmist cry for deliverance. God shows us where we must, yet, yield to Him in trusting obedience and mercy.

##### Saul Tries to Kill David

[![Saul Tries to Kill David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day111.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KfWA1ZLVHN0 "Saul Tries to Kill David")

##### Day 111 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Samuel 18:1 & 4
*By the time David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own self.*

When David killed Goliath and thus saved Israel from oppression and slavery under the enemy, Saul‚Äôs son, Jonathan, recognized the great significance of David's victory and it affected him personally. Jonathan knew that he would have never been able to defeat the giant so he accepted that fact that he owed his entire existence to the one who defeated the giant. Therefore, Jonathan's heart was overwhelmed with relief and his soul was knit to David, and Jonathan loved David as his own self.
Jonathan's relationship with David was a picture of a believer's relationship with Jesus.

When a person truly understands the spiritual misery and suffering of enslavement to Satan, such a person will feel a similar attachment to Christ and will follow Christ faithfully, knowing that he/she owes their entire existence to Jesus, the one and only person who could defeat the spiritual Goliath (Satan).

*Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and handed it over to David, along with his military dress, even his sword, bow, and belt.*

By handing over his robe, military garments, sword, bow and belt to David, Jonathan surrendered himself completely to David.

As it was with Jonathan and David, so it must be with us and Christ.

##### Day 111 Saul Envy is making him evil, treacherous, and murderous

Envy is a deadly sin, it‚Äôs one of the 7 deadly sins. Envy is described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church
Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself, even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a neighbor it is a mortal sin:
St. Augustine saw envy as "the diabolical sin." "From envy are born hatred, detraction, calumny, joy caused by the misfortune of a neighbor, and displeasure caused by his prosperity." CCC 2539
The 9th and 10th commandment warns us against envy, - do not covet your neighbor's wife or goods.
2538 The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from the human heart.
We see King Saul being tormented with the sin of Envy; Saul has an eye on David. Saul's son Jonathan has this great friendship with David and tries to make peace between David and Saul. David does not hesitate to fight any battle that Saul puts him in. However, when David came back victorious the people rejoiced and celebrated. They said:
‚ÄúSaul has slain his thousands, And David his Ten thousands‚Äù 1 Sam 18:7
This made Saul very angry and this saying displeased him. So Saul tries to kill David when David was playing the lyre. Saul tried a few times over, but with no success. So Saul plots to send him to battle the Philistines ‚Äì thinking that David will be killed at the battle. This does not work as well ‚Äì David came back victorious.
Then David promises his elder daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage but when the time comes he marries her off to someone else.
Then Saul finds out that his younger daughter Michal loves Saul, he wanted to trick David again, he asked David to get 100 foreskins of Philistines as a marriage gift, and David gets 200. Once David marries Michal ‚Äì Saul attempts to kill him again, but Michal rescues him. We can clearly see that Saul‚Äôs envy has become toxic, he has become evil, treacherous, and murderous, and evil spirits are controlling Saul.
We need to keep envy in check, even when it‚Äôs little, like small jealousy towards our friends and neighbors. Because even the best of us can fall prey to envy. David who was such a good example of keeping envy away and showing mercy towards Saul, David falls into the sin of envy himself. In future episodes, we will see how David will lust for Bathsheba and act out of envy. David will do the same envious acts that Saul did to David, David will send Bathsheba‚Äôs husband to fight in front and die just so that David can get what he is eyeing from the roof.
Let us pray for the grace to always be satisfied with what we have, let us not try to keep up with the Joneses. Let us thank God for what we have and lavish on the good things we have rather than envy what we don‚Äôt.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### True Friendship

[![True Friendship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day112.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YBUjo2zjE_0 "True Friendship")

##### Day 112 A Faithful Friend is a treasure

Family is given to us, but Friends are our choice. It is very important to choose the correct friends for they can save our lives or ruin them.
We see the friendship of David and Jonathan, they were true friends. They both had faith and courageous hearts, they were ready to do anything for the Lord. Jonathan has tried to unite his father Saul and David but to no avail. Jonathan is willing to stand up for David to the point where Saul even throws a spear at him. Jonathan was a true friend because he was ready to risk his own life for his friend David.
We have a true friend in Jesus, who while we were yet sinners He died for us. Jesus is our true friend because he gave us everything, he stood up for us even to the point of death.
There is no greater love than to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.John 15:13
If we don‚Äôt spend time with our friends we will never grow deep in friendship.
It‚Äôs the same with our relationship with Jesus, we need to spend time praying, talking, and listening to His word and to His promptings. We need to talk to Jesus about every little thing that happens to us and know that He is with us every moment of the day and night.
We should also pray for good friends for us and good friends for our children/grandchildren. We should look for friends who have faith, friends who are faithful, friends who we can depend on, and share our burdens and joys. Friends who we can celebrate our life events with. Not friends with benefits or friends who can do us a favor, we need true friendships ‚Äì where there is no judgment.
We should find a friend who is closer than a brother, not friends who will ruin us.
One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. Prov 18:24
These verses from Sirach are true wisdom, let them be our guide to find those friends, that are a sturdy shelter, the faithful friends who are a treasure.
Friendship, False and True
5 Pleasant speech multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies. 6 Let those who are friendly with you be many, but let your advisers be one in a thousand. 7 When you gain friends, gain them through testing, and do not trust them hastily. 8 For there are friends who are such when it suits them, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 9 And there are friends who change into enemies, and tell of the quarrel to your disgrace. 10 And there are friends who sit at your table, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 11 When you are prosperous, they become your second self, and lord it over your servants; 12 but if you are brought low, they turn against you, and hide themselves from you. 13 Keep away from your enemies, and be on guard with your friends.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also.
Sirach 6:51-17
May we be Jesus‚Äôs true friend, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts.
May we also find true spiritual friends in this world.
And ‚Äúyes‚Äù we are all true friends in the BIAY group ‚Äì praying for each other and growing in our friendship with Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Broken Trust

[![Broken Trust](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day113.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YFVnETlkils "Broken Trust")

##### Day 113 ‚ÄúCrossing the limit‚Äù to succeed.

We read about David and his men, eating the bread of the presence as they had nothing else to eat as they were fleeing Saul. We also need the bread of the presence ‚Äì Eucharist to strengthen us on our journey.
Saul finds out about it and is perusing David, he is furious and wants to find out who helped David. When no one answered ‚Äì ‚ÄúDoeg‚Äù ceased the opportunity to please the King. Doeg tells Saul that Ahimelech was the one who helped David. Saul wanted his servants to kill Ahimelech, but no one wanted to touch God‚Äôs anointed priest. Doeg stoops to a even lower place, He kills Ahimelech and 85 others who wore priestly garments. What a shame, such betrayal by Doeg. Doeg was ready to do anything to please the King and possibly enhance his own position and win the Kings favor.
We could sometimes sell our selves short, we may accept to do shameful/unlawful/ethical things that may results in personal gain. For example giving a bribe to get some work done. Giving your boss a costly gift to pursue promotion. Sometimes it could be denying Jesus in order to be accepted in our friend circle.

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mark 8:36

We need to heed the words of Jesus, to be true and genuine disciples of the Lord. We cannot be two timing the Lord or our friends and family. Let us learn to deny ourselves and be honest with ourselves and with everyone. Jesus looks at our heart and know us through and through. There is nothing worth more than our souls, let our actions, thoughts and words reflect what is in our hearts. May we never be tempted to sell ourselves cheap, we are God‚Äôs precious children.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### David Saves Keilah

[![David Saves Keilah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day114.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qJnOqwxCHRM "David Saves Keilah")

##### Day 114 Consult the Lord before you act ‚Äì discernment

We see that David was faced with a big decision to make, he was approached to save the city of Keilah for the Philistines were fighting against Keilah and were robbing the threshing floors. David could have just denied their request as David was not armed (only had Goliath's sword) and only had a bunch of men who were far from an army of any sorts ‚Äì a bunch of afraid men. The below verse describes David‚Äôs arm.
2 And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered themselves unto him. And he became a captain over them, and there were with him about four hundred men. 1 Sam 22:2
David could have just disregarded that ask of the people and redirected them to King Saul. However, David decides not to go with his own thoughts but to consult the Lord instead. He asks the Lord and gets a clear direction to save Keilah, however, he is met with a negative response from his men and counselors. David goes back to the Lord and asks more detailed questions. David goes back and forth with all his doubts about the people betraying him to King Saul.
As we read about David asking the Lord for direction, we cannot help but apply this to our lives. We ought to seek the Lord‚Äôs will on all major things that we take on in life. It‚Äôs called discernment. There are many ways to discern the will of the Lord and it‚Äôs not "a one size fits all".
Some people use the common-sense method of listing out the pros and cons and then evaluating it against God‚Äôs holy teaching, some folks resort to quiet prayers and listening to the Lord, some ask for signs from the Lord, some go with what makes them feel peaceful. Whatever the method, the important thing is to discern God‚Äôs will in everything that we do.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### King Saul is Spared

[![King Saul is Spared](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day115.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cAVZd_8AucA "King Saul is Spared")

##### Day 115 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Samuel 24:3-21
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/1Samuel/24/3-21

Saul was consumed with envy.

Envy and jealousy are not the same.

*Jealousy* causes us to wish for the blessings or success which others possess. It does not necessarily seek the destruction of others. In fact, jealousy can motivate us to be better than others, which is good. But sometimes jealousy can cause us to steal the blessings or success which others possess and that is bad. Jealousy, however, must never progress to envy.

*Envy*, on the other hand, causes us to grieve at someone's blessings or success, and rejoice at someone's sufferings or failures. Envy causes us to desire the destruction of those who are better than us. Envy resents the good in others like it was with Cain and Saul. Envy is a capital sin.

Saul, the king of a nation, forgot his duty towards the people and gathered 3,000 men, only to run in pursuit of an innocent man, David, from his own kingdom, and to destroy him. In addition, Saul took pleasure in listening to people who fed him with negative information about David (1 Samuel 24:9).

How did things get so bad?

It is because Saul was envious of David, and without realizing it he was lowering his own dignity.

But inspite of all that Saul was doing to destroy David, David did not take revenge on Saul, even when he got a chance to do it because Saul was anointed for the work of God (1 Samuel 24:10).

Are we also like Saul, or are we like David?
Do we take pleasure in the destruction of others or do we rejoice at the success and blessings received by others?
Do we take liberty to harm or to speak ill about God's anointed ones (popes, bishops, nuns, clergy, etc.)?
Let us examine ourselves.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

##### Day 115 Deal kindly with those who deserve our wrath

King David was treated unjustly by King Saul for some time now. King Saul was perusing him, for no reason. David has a pure heart to serve King Saul. However King Saul tried to kill David many times over, he has killed many people who helped David.
Now Saul was with 3000 men is trying to kill David and goes into a cave to relieve himself. David and his men were already in the cave trying to hide from Saul. David has a very good opportunity to kill Saul, end his misery, and become King of Israel. However, David does not take the easy route, he chooses to spare Saul‚Äôs life, only cutting off a portion of his skirt to prove his faithfulness. David calls Saul 'Father' and reminds him of the honor he has for Saul.
This works ‚Äì I can hear Saul‚Äôs heart melt when he says ‚ÄúIs this your voice, my son David?‚Äù
Saul did not expect this, he said ‚ÄúDavid you are more righteous than me‚Äù.
Saul even gives David a blessing that David should be the King of Israel.
We should think and act like David. Like David said ‚ÄúHow can I lay a hand on God‚Äôs anointed‚Äù we should also look at a child of God(see Jesus in them) and say ‚ÄúHow can I do or say anything to this brother/sister of mine‚Äù.
We are called to a higher calling by Jesus.
38 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.‚Äô 39 But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; 40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; 41 and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. 42 Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.
43 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven;
Matt 5:38-45
Let us try our very best to be a good example to our family, friends, and neighbors. If we get angry when others are angry ‚Äì it will only escalate, however, if we give in and let go of our ego it will defuse the situation.
It's easier said than done, let us all pray for strength to do the right thing.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### David and Abigail

[![David and Abigail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day116.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iS2jyhKlgpU "David and Abigail")

##### Day 116 Be a peacemaker like Abigail

We read how King David was about to wipe out every man who Nabal was Lord over. Nabal was a wicked man and insulted David who dealt kindly with Nabal‚Äôs men. Nabal was extremely rich but did not spare a small portion in exchange for David‚Äôs protection.
Nabal‚Äôs wife Abigail hears of this and wants to bring peace between them. She sends food and wine for David and his men to feast on, she also goes out herself to meet David, bows down, and intercedes on behalf of her husband. This changes David‚Äôs heart and prevents bloodshed, David is spared the sin of killing innocent men. Nabal hears of what Abigail did and his heart failed him and he died 10 days later. David did not forget Abigail he took her as a wife after Nabal died.
We need to be another Abigail every time there is a need for peacemaking. We need to intercede and be an instrument to calm down the people who are hyper. We need to pray and unite family and friends. Let us not add fuel to fire, instead throw cool water on those who are burning with the fire of anger and revenge. Remember the reward is great for the peacemakers.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Mat 5:9
Let us bring peace to those who have strife, let them be happy to hear the sound of our feet, the feet that bring the good news of peace.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Reverence and Faithfulness

[![Reverence and Faithfulness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day117.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HNEXWB0x-L0 "Reverence and Faithfulness")

### Day 117 God holds our tears in a bottle

We read Psalm 56 today and read David‚Äôs plea to the Lord.
‚ÄúYou have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle! Are they not in your book?‚Äù Ps 56: 8
David knew that God is not distant or ignorant of our troubles and enemies. That God cares for us and is watching us every moment of our lives. God knows when bad things are done to us and keeps a record of it.
David does not want to take revenge on King Saul, even though Saul is perusing David to kill him. David did nothing wrong until this point, Saul just wants to kill him out of envy.
David knew where Saul was encamping at night snuck in and had the opportunity to kill Saul with his own spear, the spear that Saul threw at David(many times). But David did not do it out of reverence for God‚Äôs anointing on Saul.
We can learn two things from this. 1. Reverence 2. Not seeking revenge

1. Reverence:
   We should have reverence for God‚Äôs anointed people, the priests and the religious. There are many bad priests who have done nasty things in the church, however, we should not label every priest to be that way. We need to have reverence for the priests and religious, they have decided to dedicate their entire lives to God. Even though they may not be as nice as we want them to be, we owe them reverence because of God‚Äôs anointing on their lives.
2. Not Seeking revenge:
   When something bad is done to us, we can either retaliate and hurt that person back or we can choose to let go and allow God to handle the situation. It is not easy but with prayer and God‚Äôs grace, we will be able to forgive.
   Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God‚Äôs wrath, for it is written: ‚ÄúIt is mine to avenge; I will repay,‚Äù says the Lord. Rom 12:19
   May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 118 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted.

Psalm 34 is one of those Psalms that we need to read daily and remember. It reminds us to praise God every day and for everything, in fact, it prescribes us to praise God ‚Äúalways‚Äù. We are invited not to boast of our own victories, but rather humble ourselves and boast in the Lord alone. We can invite others to praise God with us and invite them to magnify the Lord and exalt the Lord in unity and with joy.
I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. Ps 34:1-3
There are times when it‚Äôs hard to praise God, when things go wrong or when we are caught up in sin. Do not despair or stop praising God, for He will answer us when we call to Him. He will deliver us from all our fears, when we cry out he will hear us, when we are in trouble he will save us, save us from every trouble; he will put angels in charge over us who will encamp around us; those who take refuge in him will be happy; those who look to him are radiant, their faces never covered with shame. Even if the young lion suffers, those who trust in the Lord will lack nothing that is good.
I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 5 Look to him, and be radiant; so your faces shall never be ashamed. 6 This poor soul cried, and was heard by the Lord, and was saved from every trouble. 7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 8 O taste and see that the Lord is good; happy are those who take refuge in him. 9 O fear the Lord, you his holy ones, for those who fear him have no want. 10 The young lions suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
Remember the Lord is near to the brokenhearted, he saves those who are crushed in spirit. The next time you feel broken-hearted and crushed in your spirit, remember that the Lord is close to you. I join the psalmist today to invite you to taste and see that the Lord is good.
The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. 18
O taste and see that the Lord is good; 8

##### David's Wisdom

[![David's Wisdom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day119.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HWAJShQ-aVs "David's Wisdom")

##### Day 119 Always turn to the Lord for guidance

David till now has shown great character, he has been trying to make peace with Saul ‚Äì sparing Saul‚Äôs life a few times over. It takes two hands to clap, and sometimes in life if the other party just does not want to make peace, there is little that we can do, we have to just pray and offer them to the Lord. That is what David did and eventually, we see the bad end of Saul‚Äôs life, even Saul‚Äôs sons died in battle.
While Saul was doing everything wrong, consulting diviners and breaking his own rules. David on the other hand is doing the right thing, when the Philistines invaded Ziklag and took all the women and children including David‚Äôs wives, David did not go after them in haste ‚Äì to avenge and bring back all the families.
David put on the Ephod ‚Äì priests' cloths and consulted the Lord in prayer. This is so important, let me say it again, ‚ÄúThis is so important‚Äù the key between doing the right and wrong thing is consulting the Lord and turning to God for guidance.
Let us constantly turn to God for His guidance and will. We are called to be led by the Holy Spirit because those who are led by the Spirit are God‚Äôs children.
because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Rom 8:15
When we come to the crossroads of life, there are always many roads to take. Some lead to good and some to evil, we know that we should always avoid the road that leads to evil. But which good road should we take, only the Holy Spirit can guide you to do God‚Äôs will. The Holy Spirit will use people, and events and also prompt you directly, the key is to be in tune with the Holy Spirit.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. Gal 5:25
Let us not be like Alice in Wonderland ‚Äì who at a crossroad did not know which road to take, when the bunny asked her where do you want to go, she said does not matter. Then the bunny replied ‚Äì then it does not matter which road you should take.
‚ÄúIf we are failing to plan then we are planning to fail ‚Äú
Let us not be blown in any direction by the winds of this world, but let us be moved by the breath of God, the Holy Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### David Mourns Saul

[![David Mourns Saul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day120.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Oan8WXGEILk "David Mourns Saul")

##### Day 120 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Samuel 1:1-12
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/2Samuel/1/1-12

Normally when our enemies perish, we either rejoice or we are relieved. But David wasn't like us. When he heard that Saul and his son Jonathan had died in battle, David neither rejoiced nor was he relieved. Instead, David mourned because their nation lost an anointed king.

David is known as "a man after God's own heart" because he loved his enemies as much as he loved his friends, just as God loves us irrespective of whether we are holy or sinful.

2 Samuel 1:10
*In 1 Samuel 31:4-5, the report said that Saul killed himself.*
This was a report given by someone who had been at the battle of Gilboa in the north.

*In 2 Samuel 1:10, the report said that a man killed Saul.*
The Amelekite messenger was living in Ziklag in the South and Amelekites were Israel‚Äôs enemy. He proved that he killed Saul by showing David Saul‚Äôs crown and armlet, probably assuming that he would get a reward for killing the man who was after David‚Äôs life.

Disrespecting God‚Äôs anointed man is bad but killing him is worse.
Although David sensed that the man was lying, he ordered the man to be killed because the man himself declared that he had killed Saul who was the Lord‚Äôs anointed servant.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

##### Day 120 Lies bring death, truth sets us free.

We read that account of the man who tried to find favor in David‚Äôs eyes, he claims to have killed King Saul himself. We all know from a few chapters ago, that King Saul fell on his own sword and died. This man lost his life, because of his lie.
My mom had this saying
‚ÄúIf you tell one lie, you will need to tell 10 more to cover up. You will forget what lies you told and eventually get caught. Just tell the truth and your heart will be lightened‚Äù
Almost everyone has this weakness of telling lies, some tell small lies, and some tell big terrible lies. Some lies are easy to avoid as we make a conscious decision to tell them, some lies are so inbuilt into us that we are living a fake life.
Just look at your Facebook profile and it would always be the best photo you have taken in years, some people are even too ashamed to upload a picture ‚Äì because they don‚Äôt think they look good enough. (Of course, some don‚Äôt upload a picture for security reasons ‚Äì that‚Äôs totally different) many people are living a lie, like a separated spouse who is still hoping for the spouse (who moved on) to come back, like an overweight person who looks into the mirror and says that ‚Äì I‚Äôm not that big after all, like an addict that says this is my last puff, drink or dose. Some people are unable to accept the truth about themselves, like a man losing his hair, who wants to think that it's just a phase of hair loss, like the woman covering her wrinkles in excess, makeup, like the girlfriend who is afraid to say no her boyfriend thinking that he will leave her if she does.
We all wear masks ‚Äì we are different people when alone and put on an act when people are watching us.
Like my mom said, life will be very easy if we can be upfront and truthful about everything and with everyone. Remember the truth will set you free, it will allow you to be yourself and not be ashamed of who you are. All lies come from the devil, he is the father of all lies and deception.
44 You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father‚Äôs desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Jh 8:44
When a light is turned on all darkness is vanished, in the same way Jesus is that truth that will expose all lies. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. We ought to build our lives in truth by abiding in God‚Äôs word in truth, for the truth will set us free.
‚ÄúIf you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù Rom8:32
The Holy spirit will lead us into all the truth and help us rid ourselves of lies and falsehood.
But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. ‚Äì John 16:13
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### Cycle of Violence

[![Cycle of Violence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day121.jpg)](https://youtu.be/myNvyi1yJlA "Cycle of Violence")

Fr. Mike talks about how revenge and violence can become a cycle that doesn't end until someone chooses to end it. He also points out how the genealogy in 1 Chronicles reflects the genealogy of Christ.The reading for today are 2 Samuel 2, 1 Chronicles 2, and Psalm 24.

##### Day 121 Be a pioneer in doing the right thing

Judah was always what went up first when Israel marched into battle. Judah means praise and it should be the same with us as well, when we pray ‚Äì praise should always go up first before any petitions. Judah is again the first to instate David as King, we read that David was anointed to be king but was very humbly and patiently waiting for God‚Äôs time. Judah in a way is a pioneer in doing the correct thing first. We are called to be pioneers as well, to be zealous for the Lord. We should be on the lookout for opportunities to serve God and His people.
There is this famous saying ‚ÄúIf the devil can‚Äôt make you bad, he will make you evil.‚Äù
We need to be available for the Lord, we need to have the attitude of ‚ÄúSpeak Lord I am listening‚Äù, because
‚ÄúThe Lord does not call the qualified, but He qualifies the called‚Äù.
God may be calling you to do something you have never done before, or you feel you are not unable to do.
‚ÄúWe are called to be faithful and not successful; success or failure is what God takes care of‚Äù
Be a pioneer and a leader in doing good things for the Lord. May we have the courage and faith to say ‚ÄúFor me and my house, we will serve the Lord‚Äù. Even if we face a lot of resistance from family, friends, and society, we need to keep on moving forward.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Mat 6:33
One important thing as pioneers is "to do God‚Äôs will".
We see Judah proclaimed David as King, however, the commander of Saul took Ish-bosheth and made him king over all of Israel. As we continue to read we will see that only God‚Äôs ‚Äòwill‚Äô prevails and David will become king of the whole of Isreal. Let us be a pioneer in doing God‚Äôs will not doing as we wish.
Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain Ps 127:1
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

##### Abner Is Killed

[![Abner Is Killed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day122.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6PkwdySN5sg "Abner Is Killed")

##### Day 122 Revenge should not be encouraged

A little back story will help us understand why Joab assistants Abner. Abner was Saul‚Äôs commander, after Saul died Abner took one of Saul‚Äôs sons - Ish-bosheth, and made him King of Israel. Fierce war breaks out between David‚Äôs men and Ish-bosheth‚Äôs army. Now Abner was one of the main commanders, David‚Äôs men were winning, and Abner and his men were running away. Now Asahel was a fast runner who ran like a wild gazelle. Abner warned Abner to not peruse him because he did not want to kill him. Asahel did not listen and Abner killed him in self-defense. This is fair play as far as war rules go.
Now Ish-bosheth accuses Abner, Abner was the one who originally installed Ish-bosheth, and decides to leave and join forces with David. David welcomes him and I‚Äôm sure they would eventually overturn Ish-bosheth.
However Joab has other plans, he calls Abner aside and kills him. Joab has revenge in his heart, he wanted to avenge his brother Asahel‚Äôs death. This is very sheepish of him to kill the great commander Abner without a proper fight.
King David does not accept this, being a just and truthful person, he calls a public fast. He even invites Joab to repent of his sin and mourn.
David‚Äôs lament song tells the whole story
Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze shackles. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. 2 Sam 24
We should take a public stand for everything that is unjust. For example: We need to take a stand as a Pro-Life supporter and do everything that we can to protect innocent unborn children from being murdered. Whenever there is evil done, we need to boldly reject it and take a stand against all violence, racism, hate crime, bullying, and injustice. Let us not be ashamed about our stance on sin or evil.
May The Holy Spirit lead us.üôè

##### Day 122 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 4:9-10
*Jabez became the most distinguished of his brothers.*
*At birth his mother had named him Jabez, saying, ‚ÄúI bore him with pain.‚Äù*
*Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: ‚ÄúOh, that you may truly bless me and extend my boundaries! May your hand be with me and make me free of misfortune, without pain!‚Äù And God granted his prayer.*

The life and prayer of Jabez teaches us that our origins don't determine our destinies, and our requests should reflect the greatness of our God, not the smallness of our own expectations.

If you are labelled as a "*pain*" or by any other negative nickname, by people around you, simply cry out to the Lord, like Jabez, and ask Him to release you of this curse. The Lord of Jabez will surely hear you and answer you, even if there‚Äôs a delay, just as He did for Jabez.

*‚ÄúBless me and extend my boundaries.‚Äù*
Let us ask God to bless us and extend our spiritual boundaries.

*‚ÄúMay your hand be with me.‚Äù*
Let us pray to God for His guidance in everything we do.

*‚ÄúMake me free of misfortune.‚Äù*
Let us pray to God to protect us from evil.

*‚ÄúMake me free of pain.‚Äù*
Let us pray to God to help us to break the curse of sins in our lives by making true repentance.

##### The Death of Ish-bosheth

[![The Death of Ish-bosheth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rC1H0abVdlM "The Death of Ish-bosheth")

##### Day 123 Be a person of good character

While David‚Äôs public mourning of Abner(unjustly assassinated) is fresh in our minds, we see another incident that shows us more of David‚Äôs good character. When Ish-bosheth heard the news of Abner‚Äôs death, his courage failed. He was sleeping in his chamber and two of his own captains of raiding bands assassinated him(Ish-bosheth their own King) They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David hoping for a reward and possible position in David‚Äôs army. If David was any other king of those times, he would have welcomed them and thanked them for killing his enemy. However, the only reward David gave them is death.
David again is demonstrating great character, he is a just King(at least till now) ‚Äì one who is pre-figuring Jesus the king of kings. David does not want injustice to happen even to his enemies.
Doesn‚Äôt this remind us of Jesus' teaching
43 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòLove your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. Mat 5:43-45
We are called to be people of good character, not just from an outward appearance but from the inside. All our actions flow from the heart, we need to have a clean heart. A heart that is just and fair, a heart that does not have partiality, a heart that genuinely wants the good of others.
Let us pray and ask for this new heart of flesh that is promised in Ezekiel.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. Ez 36:26
We see that David has this pure heart now, but later he commits sin and finds corruption in his heart that is why he prays.
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Ps 51:10
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### King David Rules

[![King David Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day124.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7EU6urkQGbI "King David Rules")

##### Day 124 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 5:1-4
*Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, ‚ÄúLook, we are your bone and flesh.‚Äù*
By recalling Adam's words (Genesis 2:23) Israel, the bride of God, chose David as their bridegroom King. Saul was the first man chosen for this role but he failed. David was the second one and the leaders accepted him.
But David was only a shadow of the real heavenly bridegroom King, Jesus.

*David was thirty years old when the leaders of the twelve tribes crowned him king. Thereafter he made a Covenant with the leaders of the twelve tribes and started his office.*
Jesus was 30 years old when He started His ministry (Luke 3:23) and 33 years old when He was declared a king by the people (John 12:13). Thereafter He made a Covenant with His twelve Apostles in the Upper Room (Matthew 26:28).
Priests and kings had to be minimum thirty years of age to start their work because, according to the Jewish culture, thirty years was considered to be the age of maturity / wisdom.

The establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the old Covenant and God chose David to be the priest (2 Samuel 24:18 & 25), prophet (Acts 2:29-30) and king (2 Samuel 5:3), all three in one, the prototype of Jesus and the patriarch of the kingdom. Thus, Jesus becomes the true ‚ÄúSon of David.‚Äù

Likewise, the establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the new Covenant and Jesus, the Son of David, was chosen by God to be the Priest (Hebrews 7:15-17; Revelation 1:13), Prophet (Matthew 13:57) and King (John 12:13-15) of the heavenly Kingdom.

2 Samuel 5:6-9
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/2Samuel/5/6-9

After King David conquered the enemies (the Jebusites), took over the earthly Jerusalem and sat on the throne, he brought the Ark of the Covenant up to the earthly Jerusalem in a liturgical procession with the priests carrying the Ark (2 Samuel 6:2). Thereafter, David made Jerusalem, not just a political capital, but also a spiritual capital, the place where all pilgrims, Jews and gentiles, were invited to worship their one true heavenly Father. This was a foreshadow of the new Covenant.

When Jesus conquered the enemy (Satan), and sat on the throne in Heaven, He opened the gates of the new Jerusalem (the Church) where all humanity, Jews and gentiles, are invited to worship their one true heavenly Father. Some decades later He took the Ark of the new Covenant (His Mother) up to the heavenly Jerusalem.

##### Day #124 ‚ÄúOne thing I ask of the Lord is to dwell in the house of the Lord forever‚Äù

Christianity is not a set of concepts or philosophy or principles or protocols it is a relationship, the ultimate relationship between God and man. The beauty of the Christian life is that God is with us always and forever. Jesus gave us this promise that ‚ÄúHe will be with us forever till the end of days‚Äù. In the OT we have the promise that even if a mother forsakes a child, God will not leave us.
The key is for us to stay close to God. One definition of sin is
‚ÄúGod, I know what you want me to do, but I want to do what I want. ‚Äú
Jesus thought us in the parable of the vine and the branches that we are branches and we need to abide in the Vine if not we will wither up.
David so far is being very obedient, constantly seeking God‚Äôs will in every battle he fights.
David knows the importance of God‚Äôs presence, that is why he prays the most important prayer ‚Äúto dwell in the house of the Lord forever‚Äù being united with God was David‚Äôs strength. We also need to develop this attitude to be aware of God‚Äôs presence in our lives and cherish prayer time. We need to develop our relationship with the Lord, He is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. We need to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and follow him. We need to be united to the Vine and receive all the needed nutrients from the Lord.
Jesus is always standing at the door of our hearts and is willing to come in if we invite Him.
We have to be aware and cautious to not let sin creep into our lives.
We see that David is starting to lose his way as he decides to do his own things by taking on many wives and concubines which was forbidden for kings (forbidden for Israel‚Äôs Kings appointed by God) we will see that this will become David‚Äôs downfall soon.
May the Holy Spirit protect us from sin and lead us.üôè

##### Covenant with David

[![Covenant with David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day125.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VVaAc2gyYgo "Covenant with David")

##### Day #125 Mary the New Ark of the covenant

In today‚Äôs reading, the most important thing to call out is this parallel between the OT ark of the covenant and Mary the new ark of the covenant. The easiest way to call out the similarities is through a table, please read the similarities in the table comparison. After reading the similarities if we still have a doubt that Mary is the new ark of the covenant, we can fast forward to Revelations Chapters 11:19 and 12:1. As a first-century Jew you have been waiting for the ark of the covenant to show up for almost 6 centuries, since the time of Jeremiah. So when John has the vision of the Revelations the big deal is that the ark that was missing is finally found in heaven.
Then God‚Äôs temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1
Let us honor our lady the new ark of the covenant that carries the fulfillment of all the old testament prefiguration - she carries Jesus. For non-Catholics, this reflection may be hard to read, would suggest just asking God for revelation with an open mind.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Old and New Covenants

![God's covenants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/oldandnewcovenants.jpg)

##### Day 125 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 6:6-7
Uzzah died because the Ark of the Covenant was not given its due respect.
According to the Law, the Ark of the Covenant was to be touched and carried only by the ordained Levites, and Uzzah was not a Levite. Also, David was transporting the Ark in a cart.
God may have given the Law to Moses centuries ago, but the Law was still the same.
God‚Äôs Law never changes from the time it is given until the end of time.

2 Samuel 6:14-15
David (the royal priest) represents Jesus, the Ark represents Mary, and Jerusalem represents God‚Äôs heavenly city.
David‚Äôs joy in bringing the Ark of the Covenant into the earthly Jerusalem prefigures the joy of Jesus in bringing Mary‚Äôs body into the heavenly Jerusalem.
Let us make sure that we don't receive a curse, like Michal did (2 Samuel 6:16 & 23), by failing to rejoice with Christ that His blessed mother is in the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 7:14
*‚ÄúI will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.‚Äù*
By these words God adopted David‚Äôs son Solomon long before Solomon was born (2 Samuel 12:24).

God first started the monarchy of His holy kingdom when He created Adam and gave him the authority to rule over the whole earth. Thus, by default, his wife Eve would be the queen. But when they brought sin into the world they lost their titles.

God later picked another couple, Abraham and Sarah, who would bring forth Isaac, the earthly son of the promise, and through Isaac would come the new Adam and the new Eve (Jesus and Mary), the king and queen mother of God‚Äôs holy Kingdom.

Many centuries later, Solomon, the son of the earthly King David and a descendant of Abraham‚Äôs son Isaac, became the son of God through the grace of adoption. Some years later, when Solomon was crowned king, at his right hand was enthroned his mother, the queen.
This was a prototype of the Heavenly Davidic Kingdom of God.

In the new Covenant, Jesus, the son of God, would become the son of David, through the grace of adoption by Joseph, and at the right hand of Jesus, in Heaven, would be enthroned His mother, the queen and a descendant of David, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom.

What David established, Solomon continued and Jesus fulfilled.
Thus we recognize that establishing a king and a queen to start the monarchy of the new Covenant, was an essential part in God‚Äôs Covenant plan for His holy Heavenly Kingdom.

##### David's Victories

[![David's Victories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day126.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JZa4niEoN00 "David's Victories")

##### Day #126 The Lord gave David victory wherever he went

In the last chapter, we see King David was gifted a Palace by the neighboring King ‚Äì who sent wood, carpenters, and workers to build a palace. Now David is concerned for the Lord and feels unworthy to live in the Palace while God rests in a tent. This seems like a very just and genuine concern for the Lord, so much so that Nathan the prophet says yes immediately. However, at night the Lord says no, but the Lord rewards David‚Äôs concern, the word of the Lord said
‚ÄúI will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth‚Äù 2 Sam 7:9
We see that David starts his wars against the neighboring kingdoms and places, the bible records the thousands of men who were conquered and those who were slain. King David‚Äôs army was winning every battle ‚Äì because of the promise of the Lord to make his name great.
‚ÄúThe Lord gave victory to David wherever he went‚Äù 2 Sam 8:14
The promises of the Lord are true and genuine.
The promises of the Lord are sure, silver refined in a crucible, silver purified seven times. Ps 12:7
Let us remember that the word of the Lord will never return empty, it will always accomplish its purpose
so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Is 55:11
So my friends let us not be discouraged but trust in the promise of the Lord for His word will never return empty but will accomplish all that God has in store for us.
David‚Äôs kingdom will enhance even more than he can imagine through his children and eventually by God himself ‚Äì in Jesus Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 126 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 10:13-14
*So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.*

King Saul lost the throne and his life because of the 4 sins which he had committed against the Lord:

1. For the massacre of priests in the city of Nob because they were protecting David;

A priest is God's anointed man who represents God on earth. When we harm a priest, physically or verbally or in any other way, we offend God directly.

2. For sparing the Amalekite King Agag out of pity, instead of destroying him in obedience to God‚Äôs command (1 Samuel 15:17-21);

The Amalekite King Agag was a symbol of sin. When we allow ourselves to live comfortably in sin, instead of destroying it completely, the sin will eventually be the cause of the destruction of our soul (Hell).

3. For not heeding Samuel‚Äôs request to wait for him for seven days to offer the sacrifice;

Offering to God the sacrifice prescribed by God, can be done only by God's anointed priests. Anyone else trying to offer the prescribed sacrifice, even if they know the procedure, is trying to be like God without God, and that is an act of the devil.

4. For consulting a necromancer, instead of consulting the Lord.

According to the Mosaic Law, consulting people who were involved with occult practices, was forbidden (Deut. 18:10).
In the new Covenant, the Church still follows the same Law to this day. Practicing divination, or using the services of people who are involved with occult practices, is a mortal sin.

In the old Covenant, Saul lost his physical life for committing these sins, but in the New Covenant, we will lose our spiritual/eternal life.

##### Kindness for the House of Saul

[![Kindness for the House of Saul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day127.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bga43-TseZg "Kindness for the House of Saul")

##### Day #127 Remembering our friends

We know that David and Jonathan ‚Äì Saul‚Äôs son were Best Friends Forever(BFF) ‚Äì in fact, they would give their lives for each other. Now that David is in a position to pay back to Jonathan ‚Äì he decides to find Jonathan's kin of Jonathan and ensure they are taken care of.
David asked, ‚ÄúIs there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan‚Äôs sake?‚Äù 2 Sam 9:1
When they found Mephibosheth, Saul‚Äôs son who was lame in both feet. David summoned him and vowed to take good care of him.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid,‚Äù David said to him, ‚Äúfor I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.‚Äù 2 Sam 7
We should be inspired to remember our friends of old, to not forget them when fortune favors us.
We should remember all our vows, our marriage vows, the promises we make at baptism to raise good children, the promises we make at confession, to avoid the near occasion of sin, and the promise we make to take care of our parents and families.
It is one thing to read the good dead‚Äôs that David did or to make promises, it‚Äôs another thing to actually keep them. That is why Jesus said the below.
‚ÄúAgain you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‚ÄòYou shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.‚Äô 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God‚Äôs throne; 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your ‚ÄòYes‚Äô be ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô and your ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Mat 5:33-37
Jesus wants us to be people of action and not just words. It‚Äôs one thing to say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and another thing to be ‚ÄúPatient, kind, not envious, not proud, not self-seeking, not holding a record of wrongs.‚Äù
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Cor 13
Let our "Yes be Yes" and our "No be No". Let us people who keep our word, we should not be all words and no action.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 127 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 12:32
*A group of men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, joined David in Hebron to make him king.*

‚ÄúTime‚Äù (in English) is either Kairos or Chronos (in Greek).
*Chronos time* refers to clock time or calendar time which humans follow, and which is mostly based on the movement of the sun or moon.
*Kairos time* is the right or perfect time when God chooses to intervene to accomplish His divine plan, and there is no fixed earthly date or time for God to intervene.
"Kairos" time can, however, become "Chronos" time after the event takes place and we either mark it on the calendar or remember it by the clock.

The group of men of Issachar understood ‚Äúkairos‚Äù time because they had a close relationship with God (Galatians 5:25). They were therefore given the knowledge and understanding that according to God‚Äôs plan David would rule Israel after Saul since David was already anointed for the same purpose. Therefore, after the death of Saul, the group of men knew that it was the right time for them to leave the house of Saul and join the house of David.

There may have been ‚Äúkairos‚Äù times in our lives too when God blessed us with miracles.
Our prayers are always heard by God on day 1 but His answers, whether positive or negative, will always come in His ‚Äúkairos‚Äù time. In the meanwhile, we must continue in our relationship with the Lord with patience.

##### Day #128 How to handle "humiliation"

We read that King David wanted to be kind and loyal to the Ammonites because Nahash the ammonite king(dead now) was good to him.
David thought, ‚ÄúI will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.‚Äù So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.2 Sam 10:2
However, Nahash‚Äôs son Hanun was influenced by his commanders and humiliates David‚Äôs men.
So Hanun seized David‚Äôs envoys, shaved off half of each man‚Äôs beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away. 2 Sam 10: 4
Now David‚Äôs men were greatly humiliated, but David handled the situation very well he went out to meet the men and asked them to stay at Jericho until their bead grew back.
David then send his Valant men who defeated the Ammoniates.
Now how do we handle humiliations? Let‚Äôs think of the last time we felt humiliated. We will mostly resort to one of two responses ‚Äì fight or flight. If we chose to fight - we will try to humiliate the other person even worse or get angry and curse them. If we resort to flight - we will try to pass it off as though nothing happened or leave the place.
The best way to handle humiliation is to pray first, and try not to get humiliated because that is what they want.
Then warn the person sternly that their word or action is not acceptable, most people would back off at this point.
If they still persist then action is needed, everyone is under some authority. And the Lord is watching over you, He will fight for you, fight for the people who do the right thing.
A true event in St Mother Theresa‚Äôs life
One day Mother Teresa went to a local bakery to ask for bread for the starving children in the orphanage. The baker, outraged at people begging for bread from him, spat in her face and refused. Mother Teresa calmly took out her handkerchief, wiped the spit from her face and said to the baker, ‚ÄúOkay, that was for me. Now what about the bread for the orphans?‚Äù The baker, shamed by her response, gave her the bread she wanted.
Like St Mother Theresa let us turn to Jesus who was humiliated, spat upon, mocked and insulted, beaten and stripped naked. He was able to pray
‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.‚Äù
It is not easy to stay calm and respond in a proper way, we are not Jesus or Mother Theresa. But we can be and God will help us in our weakness, that someday we will be able to respond in love. When people hurt us, or insult us those are all actual prayer requests, they are indirectly asking us ‚ÄúCan you pray for me?‚Äù

##### David Commits Adultery

[![David Commits Adultery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day129.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jQHbBVAaLXo "David Commits Adultery")

##### Day 129 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 11:1-27
During the spring of the year, when Kings fought at the battlefields, David sent his officers to fight the Ammonites. Against his call of duty, David chose to stay back and while away his time at the palace. David committed one grave mistake. He sent the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield. The Ark of the Covenant symbolized the presence of God. David ended up committing adultery with Bathsheba because he then rested in the palace without the presence of God.

While idling away his time, David happened to see what he was not supposed to see. He could have looked the other way and moved on with his royal duties but he chose to continue looking.

If we happen to see something that we are not supposed to see, it is definitely not our mistake. However, if we decide to continue looking on with interest, and think with passion, we are surely putting ourselves on risky grounds.

David looked on and entered the dark and dubious world of sin. He entertained the evil spirit and allowed the spirit to control his mind.

When God is not with us it is very easy for the evil spirit to control our minds to do ungodly acts.

Later, to hide one sin David ended up committing another sin by killing Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba.

The closer we get to the object of our temptation, the more destructive it gets. We must flee from sin as from a snake. Sin traps us into a vicious cycle.

When we allow ourselves to be influenced by one evil spirit, it will invite more evil spirits into our lives and thus we end up committing one sin after another to cover up the first sin if we don‚Äôt repent and try to get rid of the first one.

Failure of our spiritual lives begins with the absence of God in our lives and gradually affects our physical lives.

##### Day #129 David‚Äôs Sloth leads to Adultery and Murder

We have been reading David‚Äôs life story, he was such a lovely person ‚Äì a man after God‚Äôs heart, a just, kind, and wise King, he was a worshiper of God ‚Äì a musician and one who loved the presence of the Lord. However, he has his weaknesses‚Äì we know that he was accumulating wives and concubines which the Lord forbid for the Kings of Israel.
In this sequence of events, the first sin David committed was the sin of sloth.
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Sam 11:1
The kings in those days would go out to fight battles, however, David did not go ‚Äì he sent his commanders instead. David should have been out there fighting battles for the Lord, however, the scripture says that he was sleeping on the couch in the afternoon and walking on the roof instead.
Laziness is creeping into him, with comfort and luxury, his will and spirit are weakened. He looks at a woman bathing and should have just looked away.
From the sin of lust of the eyes, it went to lust of the thoughts. He is thinking of her and eventually makes inquiries about her. He comes to know that it‚Äôs Uriah‚Äôs wife one of his trusted men. He should have backed off at least now, but his lust overtook him. He mis-uses his power as King and gets what he wants. Bathsheba becomes pregnant and now David is desperate. He tries to fix it by bringing Uriah back to his house to sleep with his wife, just doesn‚Äôt work for Uriah was a just man.
Eventually, He plots the death of Uriah and commits murder. David was a person to consult the Lord for everything, here he is falling head over heels into different sins.
What can we learn from this? We can learn that we are all broken earthen vessels, no one is perfect not even the great people of the Bible. But God makes us all whole again.
The other thing that we can learn is that we should stop sin when it's small and easy to overcome. If David has to resist the sin of sloth, he would have gone to battle and won victories, he would have prevented the other grave sins.
We should also try to avoid the near occasion of sins, we all know our weaknesses ‚Äì we should avoid falling into bigger traps. For example: If you struggle with the sin of alcoholism ‚Äì avoid going to a bar or going out with friends who love to drink,
if you are addicted to shopping ‚Äì do not carry your credit card ‚Äì use cash when you go shopping,
if you are addicted to pornography ‚Äì use your devices only in public places/family rooms.
It is easy to say no to sin at the beginning ‚Äì once you cross the hedge ‚Äì you cannot stop yourself.

##### Nathan Condemns David

[![Nathan Condemns David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day130.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OqvYL60-Zio "Nathan Condemns David")

##### Day 130 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 12:1-15
David committed a sin by killing an innocent man (Uriah) to cover up his first sin of adultery (2 Samuel 11:1-25).

When prophet Nathan asked David to judge a case of a poor man being robbed by a rich man, David was quick to condemn the rich man for the injustice, while he kept his own sin covered.

We all commit sins due to the weakness of our damaged souls. Some of us are aware of our own weaknesses and we try to correct and improve ourselves, which is good. But some of us are blind to our own weaknesses while the weaknesses in others are so obvious to us that we condemn them.

Jesus said, ‚ÄúLet the one among you who is without sin, be the first one to throw a stone at her‚Äù (John 8:7).

God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17).

I came not to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12:47).

When Jesus does not condemn us, then who are we to condemn others?
When we see weaknesses or sins in others, let us be slow to condemn them. Let it be an occasion for us to do a soul-searching, make a list of our own weaknesses and ask the Lord for pardon.

##### Day #130 ‚Äú3 C‚Äôs to Repentance ‚Äì Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart‚Äù

As we study Bible Characters we should always place ourselves in their shoes or identify with them, as we are all weak human beings. Apart from reading about their horrendous sins, we should also learn how they dealt with them. King David can teach us a great lesson on repentance, in fact, his Psalm, Psalm 51 has been the one most people use when they have committed a sin and are repenting. There is a big misconception about Christian repentance, because of the word used. The word repentance is defined as - sincere regret or remorse. However, repentance is not merely feeling sorry about what you did, it is being contrite and deciding to change your ways. The Greek word used in the gospels is
Metanoia‚Äì which means ‚Äúa transformative change of heart‚Äù.
There are three steps to repentance.
CONVICTION
We see that King David commits major sins of Sloth, Adultery, and Murder and now breaks another one of the 10 commandments by bringing Bathsheba into his home, thinking that all is well. But the Lord was not happy about His servant David. He sends the prophet Nathan to tell David the story about the unjust owner of many sheep. David is cut to his heart, and he is convicted of his sin.
We need people in our lives to tell us when we are going off track, our spouse, parents, children, friends, society, priest, confessors, spiritual directors, events, retreats, sermons, word of God, talks, BIAY whatever it takes to convict us. We need the Holy Spirit who will lead us to all truth about ourselves, the Holy Spirit will convict us of our mistakes.
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Ps 51:3
CONTRITION
a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. Ps 51:17
This is the golden verse for repentance, when we are convicted of sin we should be cut to the heart. Feeling sorry for having offended our ever-loving God. We should not just focus on the wrong thing we did, but on the relationship that is broken due to sin. We are hurting our God and our neighbor when we sin, we are actually hurting the church as we are the body of the church. We cannot come to the Lord with pride or excuses for committing sin. just with a contrite and broken heart
Change of Heart
It just does not stop at sorrow for sin, it starts with a Change of heart. We have a God of second chances, He wants us to overcome sin and death. God will take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh; He will put a new and willing spirit in us. Change is the most important part of repentance. Whenever Jesus healed or forgave sin in His earthly ministry he always said ‚Äì ‚ÄúSin no more‚Äù
So what happens if we fall into sin again, don‚Äôt be discouraged just follow the process again CCC ‚Äì Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart. If you keep falling into sin, just keep getting up.
Saint Faustina reminds us to never give up.
I perform works of mercy in every soul. The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. My mercy is confirmed in every work of My hands. He who trusts in My mercy will not perish, for all his affairs are Mine, and his enemies will be shattered at the base of My footstool (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 723).
Just keep going to the font of mercy whenever you need to be washed of your sin. Eventually, the Lord will break you out of the sins you are unable to shake off. All the three C‚Äôs are present in the sacrament of confession, so frequent it as much as possible to rid yourself of sin.
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are‚Äîyet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God‚Äôs throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:15-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #131 Lust does not satisfy

We read this horrendous event of a brother raping his stepsister, it‚Äôs truly very hard to read. Amnon is David‚Äôs son who has a very beautiful stepsister Tamar. Amnon was so obsessed with her that he made himself ill because of the sister. Amnon had a crafty friend who gave him this nasty idea to pretend to be sick just to be with her alone. Amnon forced himself on Tamar because she declined his advances and raped her as he was stronger than her. Something surprising happens after he rapes her, he hates her. He loved her earlier or though he did - he only stiring up lust in his own being.
Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, ‚ÄúGet up and get out!‚Äù2 Sam 13:15
One would assume that he would be happy and satisfied for he got what he wanted. But he only hated her after it, because she reminded him of his brokenness. This is the result when people lust over things and people, it never ends in fulfillment.
When people are looking to gratify their own desires, they are mistaken, they will never be satisfied. It‚Äôs like picking at a healing scab, it gets hurt again and bleeds causing another scab. This continues and the person never heals but the wound gets bigger and bigger. People who are in a relationship just for the pleasure will never be satisfied and we look for other options.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:18
Lust and sexual immorality is a sin that hurts the sinner as he/she is sinner against his/her own body. The Bible asks us to flee from this sin as we are hurting ourselves.
One tires to blame the media, society and the devil for the sins of lust, however it's mostly the desires within that person that is to be blamed.
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death. James 1:14-15
If we let the sin of lust rein in us, we will eventually become spiritually blind and find it hard to come out of the trap, which leads to spiritual death.
Let us love instead of lust. Look for the benefit of the other person and their well-being. The sacrament of marriage celebrates the union of the husband and wife, who are open to life and open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### David And Absalom

[![David And Absalom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day132.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZFb0B0AZ_Js "David And Absalom")

##### Day #132 Holding a grudge - Michael Eltham

We are still getting over the misery that Tamar went through, her stepbrother Amnon raped her and threw her away. Her whole life was ruined she could not get married after that as in the Jewish custom then, only virgins get married. Her brother Absalom takes her into his house and she lives her life as a desolate woman. What a tragedy, a life wasted due to Amnon‚Äôs lust. If it wasn't for Amnon, Tamar would have gotten married and had children and raised them, she is deprived of the family life. This caused a lot of hate in Absalom‚Äôs heart, and he worked up a plan to avenge His sister‚Äôs rape. He invites the sons of David for an event at his house and had Amnon killed.
Absalom flees and is in hiding. Now Joab tries to patch things up by tricking David to listen to a wise woman‚Äôs fake story(Joab tried to use the format Nathan used to convict David of his sin ‚Äì by telling a similar story) we can read the story, and eventually, David asks Absalom to come back to the city. However, David does not let him come into his presence for two full years. Absalom is getting frustrated as the king asked him to come back but does not let him come into his presence. The Kind does not talk to Absalom directly, he is letting him stay in the city but does not accept him back as a son. David and Absalom are just tolerating each other here, there is no repentance or forgiveness, and the love is not restored.
This is the state of many families today, there is a lot of hate, misunderstanding, and grudges between family members ‚Äì between parents and children, between siblings, between cousins, between in-laws. Most people are taking the positions that David and Absalom took ‚Äì no repentance or forgiveness ‚Äì we are just tolerating each other without actually sorting out the problem, without genuine repentance or forgiveness. There is bitterness in the air, one person not talking to the other, not seeing eye to eye, hurtful words and gestures.
The model we have in David and Absalom is not the one we should be following. We should follow the model of the prodigal son and the Father. The Father in the parable was looking out for his son every day, waiting for him to come back, David was just grieving his other son's death and not even concerned about Absalom. Absalom was acting like the prodigal son, the prodigal son had an attitude of ‚ÄúAt least I will be a servant at my father's house‚Äù - Absalom was burning down fields in frustration.
Let us model our repentance and forgiveness on the parable of the prodigal son. Let us pray for our families and especially for the strained relationships. It is easier said than done, but let us not feel discouraged for ‚Äúwhen we are weak He is strong.‚Äù

##### Day #133 Falling to correct our kids can make them rebellious

As we try to wrap our heads around the mess in David‚Äôs family, Amnon rapes his stepsister Tamar and her brother Absalom avenging it by killing Amnon (his stepbrother). One can‚Äôt help but call out the lack of action on David‚Äôs part. David being their father should have stepped in and handled the situation better, he should have asked the Lord for direction on what needed to be done. David was great when it came to his ruling as King but he let his personal life slip, he failed to be a good father.
The first mistake he made was to have so many wives and children even though God forbid it for the Kings of Israel. The second mistake was his lack of prudent about sending Tamar to Amnon‚Äôs house. The third mistake was In-action toward Amnon‚Äôs sin ‚Äì he failed to protect his daughter and failed to take her in to his house after Amnon sent her off. Fourth he failed to make peace with Absalom and failed to give him back his position as son and did not assign him any duty in the kingdom.
This caused Absalom, who was very good-looking and smart, clever, and a man with an initiative to gain popularity. Eventually, due to King David‚Äôs inaction ‚Äì he now must flee from his own son Absalom. David has let down his people and let down the Lord in failing to be a good father.
Let us learn from this and be good parents to our children, parents who love, forgive, and discipline them when they go off track. If we fail to act, we are supporting their sin. They will grow in their sin and bad habits and eventually become a beast someday. They will be a force that neighed we or society cannot content with, we will have to flee as well.

##### Day #134 We humans are prone to sin - concupiscence

Earlier Absalom was so zealous to avenge his sister‚Äôs rape, now commits rape. He gets advice from Ahithophel (David‚Äôs previous adviser and friend) who suggests a shameful act to show dominance over David. Absalom sleeps with David‚Äôs concubines in the sight of all of Israel. The one who avenged rape earlier now commits the same sin, shamelessly in public.
David earlier was just and did not lay hands on King Saul even though Saul was envious of him and tried to kill him. This same David is envious of Uriah‚Äôs wife Bathsheba and causes the murder of Uriah.
What becomes clear is that we humans can be good one day and terribly bad another day. We are prone to sin and are not strong, the flesh is weak.
We have to be careful with ourselves, given the opportunity or on a bad day, each of us can be terrible. According to the below excerpt from the CCC we all have an inclination to sin, even though the original sin is washed away in Baptism we are very capable and inclined to sin. The term is ‚Äúconcupiscence‚Äù - an inclination to evil.

CCC 405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called "concupiscence". Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.
Our enemy the devil is always on the prowl, trying to devour us. Let us never leave the side of Jesus, lest we fall into the trap that is set for us.
Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 1 Pet 5:8
May the Angels of the Lord protect and guard our hearts against every evil, harm, and danger.

##### Day #135 ‚ÄúBad counsel can lead to destruction‚Äù

Absalom is now looking for counsel to become King of Israel. Ahithophel suggests that he will choose 12K men to pursue King David and strike him down. Once the King is dead everyone will naturally follow Absalom, now everyone likes this suggestion.
Absalom wants a second opinion and asks Hushai. Hushai is loyal to David and is just pretending to be on Absalom‚Äôs side. Hushai is very crafty with his words and makes a suggestion, one that will favor King David. Before he suggests he rejects Ahithophel‚Äôs suggestion and says that 12K men will not be enough to kill King David as he is a warrior King and has Valant men who will defeat the 12K men.
Hushai suggests that Absalom take the whole of Israel and pursue David, just to ensure he does not get away. He also suggests that Absalom should personally go to battle, which appealed to him so he could get the credit for killing David. Everyone liked this suggestion better and they wanted to implement it. Hushai sends messengers ahead to David so that David can escape and be prepared to take out Absalom instead.
As we will see in future episodes Hushai‚Äôs counsel was what brought the downfall of Absalom.
We need to learn from this to be very careful about the advice we get from people. This world is filled with shrewd and cunning people who don‚Äôt really care about us. They just want their own motives met when they suggest something to us.
See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Mat 10:16
Jesus knows that this world is full of cunning people and that‚Äôs why he tells us to be wise as serpents. We cannot trust the advice of anyone, we need to test everyone to see if they come from the Lord or from the world.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1
May we find friends of good counsel and spiritual directors who can guide us on the right path.

##### Day 136 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 18:9-33
Although David was a good man, with a forgiving heart like God's, he still had his own flaws. Because of his one sin (adultery), his sons also ended up committing sins, up to the extent that his son wanted to usurp the throne from him. So David had to run away from home and hide from his own son, until his son was killed in battle.

Like David, sometimes we too may be surrounded by people who we think are our own but they connect with us only for what we have, and not because they love us or for who we are and how much we care about them. At such times we may feel alone and abandoned, but just as God rescued David from the hands of his enemies who were his own, so also God will come to our aid if we are obedient to all His Commandments.

God does not punish children for their parents‚Äô sins (Ezekiel 18:4 & 20) but when we are comfortable living with unforgiven mortal sins then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil‚Äôs aim is to destroy families, beginning with our children. Therefore, if we have committed mortal sins then we must repent, correct our errors, and confess our sins without much delay so that we can keep our souls purified at all times and be a blessing to our children.

##### DAY 136 - Shiela

Today's study David spoke as a father, not as a King, ready to forgive, Absalom his son, though it was more than a domestic quarrel. There was pride at the victory over rebellious forces but Absalom's death was a tragic to David. Absalom had three sons.
In Chronicles duties were assigned by David for the construction of the Temple, conducting regular services of morning and evening worship and burnt offerings unto the Lord.
The Psalm is a collection of Wisdom Teachings. HUMBLY submit before the Lord who never abandons His Children. God's children are never completely forsaken, infact, HIS Blessings will extend to the next generation.

##### When David Heard

[![When David Heard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/whendavidheard.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8_QTy9Jhj5k "When David Heard")

##### Day #136 The Regret of David is a warning for us to reconcile.

Note: Hit play on the song as you read this reflection.
We have been following the long saga of David‚Äôs poor role as a father. David did not act when Amnon raped his step-sister Tamar, David did not act when Tamar was sent away humiliated ‚Äì he did not help her. Because of David‚Äôs inaction - Absalom had to take matters into his own hands and punish Amnon. Indirectly David made Absalom into the beast that he became. David did not make peace with Absalom when he was in hiding. David did not accept him back as a son when he was in the city. Now Absalom is forcefully taking the kingdom from David. David whose praises were sung ‚ÄúSaul slain thousands and David ten thousand ‚Äù is now being cursed, stones and dirt is thrown on him.
David is humbled and his heart is starting to repent for his inaction as a father.
‚ÄúMy son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. ‚Äú 2 Sam 16:11
Today we read David‚Äôs instructions to deal gently with Absalom. David has not yet fully accepted him as his son as he calls him, young man.
Later when David hears that Absalom was slain, he breaks down and accepts the fact that he lost a son. He is weeping and repenting probably on his own inaction, weeping over the loss of his son. He even says ‚ÄòIf only I had died instead of‚Äô.
33 The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: ‚ÄúO my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you‚ÄîO Absalom, my son, my son!‚Äù2 Sam 18: 33
Let us not regret like David, but let us make peace with all our family and friends before they are no more. We will regret and lament once they are no more. We need to muster the courage, put our pride by the side, and make peace. Make every relationship sweet again, before it is too late.

##### Day #137 Joab holding it together for David

When we are going through a difficult patch, maybe the loss of a loved one, sickness, loss of a job, or any difficult situation. We need people to help us walk the right path, amidst our inability to think straight. We see Joab is being very practical here and picking up David‚Äôs drooping spirit.
Due to David‚Äôs inaction as a father, there is a civil war in Israel, Absalom is literally coming to kill David with almost the whole of Israel. Joab takes matters into his own hands and kills Absalom when he found him hanging in the branches of the oak tree, despite David‚Äôs warning to deal gently with him. Now David is mourning the death of Absalom and cannot see clearly the misery that this Father-son tiff has brought Israel, 20K Israelites lost their lives in this civil war.
Joab would have witnessed David‚Äôs mourning and inaction ‚Äì when Amnon raped Tamar and when Absalom killed Amnon. Joab was used to this mourning pattern of David and must have said ‚ÄúNo! not again‚Äù He was able to talk some sense into David and reinstate him as King.
He asked David to focus on what he still has and not on the one son that he lost.
We need friends like Joab who are able to lift up our spirits and help us do the right thing when our vision is blurry due to us being overwhelmed. We need a "Joab" who will fight for us when we are unable to fight, who will reason for us when we are unable to think, and make us move when we are stuck. Let us pray for such friends, who will be a sturdy shelter.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also. Sirach 6:51-17
There is an increase in people with mental conditions like never before. Depression and suicide are on the rise along with mass shootings. These drastic end events like suicide, addiction and mass shootings can be averted if there are enough people like Joab who can keep others on track, and help them look outwards and not at themselves. Most of the mental sickness comes when we focus on ourselves, if we can focus on helping others we will feel much better, and we will be motivated and inspired.

##### Day 138 Hurt for no fault of their own

We read that David has been re-instated as King and he is just settling back in. When he fleed he left 10 concubines behind to be in the house, remember Absalom wanted to show dominance over his father David and raped them in public. Now that David is back he takes them and puts them in a secure house but does not want to have anything to do with them, they live as desolate women. They have been hurt many times in their lives for no fault of their own, first off David makes them concubines ‚Äì which is itself one step lower than wives. David then leaves them when he was fleeing, Absalom then rapes them in public, and now David is just leaving them to die so to speak with not even the poor status of being a concubine. They have done nothing wrong till now, but have suffered due to others' sins.
We can relate to these poor women, there are many in this world who suffer due to other people‚Äôs sins. For Ex: The children of parents who are addicted to drugs, the young girls who are sold in the flesh trade at a tender age, and The spouse who is dealing with their partner's shortcomings and addictions. The list can go on, but what can we do, we need to help them and pray for them. Jesus‚Äô heart is moved with compassion for such people, that is why he always uplifted the widow and the orphan ‚Äì they could not fend for themselves back in the day.
However, if we face a situation that would possibly bring misery on us(for none of our wrongs) we should do our best to avoid getting into such situations. Do whatever it takes to be free and avoid such loopholes. We are children of God and should not be afraid to fight for our freedom.
For some inspiration let us look at the wise woman in the reading today who saved the whole city. The backstory is that Sheba had proclaimed himself king and was being perused by King David‚Äôs army and he took refuge in a city. Joab surrounded the city and was about to destroy the whole city. A wise woman steps in and pleaded that the city be spared and that she would take care of killing Sheba. She did and saved herself and the whole city's misery. Let us be inspired and try to wiggle our way out of trouble. Let us not be quiet and bear the consequences of others' sins.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Reparation to the Gibeonites

[![Reparation to the Gibeonites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day139.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CAD7RLyfKtU "Reparation to the Gibeonites")

##### Day 139 Rather be a gatekeeper in the house of the Lord.

We read the list of names of the gatekeeper in today‚Äôs readings, one would consider it unnecessary to list them out as they are just gatekeepers. The gatekeeper task would have been a simple task of welcoming people into the temple and also maintaining general law and order, something like the tasks of the Ushers in the church today. However small the task ‚Äì it is a task in the service of the Lord. It is a blessed task even though it may be seen as mundane and menial. The Psalmist says that it is a great role to consider and look forward to.
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than live in the tents of wickedness. PS 84:10
There is joy in the presence of the Lord and it's more fulfilling to even just stand at the door ‚Äì doing service for the Lord. The Psalmist would not trade it for a lucrative job working at the tents of the wicked. We should not think twice about doing anything for the Lord. Even though it may seem unimportant or menial, it is done for a great Lord.
We have many examples among the saints that had simple jobs ‚Äì like those of cleaning the garden or working in the kitchen of the convent. One saint that I would like to highlight is Saint Andr√© of Montreal a saint of our times, was commonly known as Brother Andr√©. He was initially rejected by the order due to his poor health.
"Andr√© was given the task of porter at Coll√®ge Notre-Dame in C√¥te-des-Neiges, Quebec, with additional duties as sacristan, laundry worker and messenger. "When I joined this community, the superiors showed me the door, and I remained 40 years," he said."
"His great confidence in Saint Joseph inspired him to recommend the saint's devotion to all those who were afflicted. On his many visits to the sick in their homes, he would rub the sick person lightly with oil taken from a lamp burning in the college chapel and recommend them in prayer to Saint Joseph."
People claimed that they had been cured through the prayers of the good Brother and Saint Joseph, and they were grateful their prayers had been heard. Brother Andr√© steadfastly refused to take any credit for these cures. Bessette's desire to see Saint Joseph honored led him in 1904 to launch a campaign to build a chapel for that purpose.
"When an epidemic broke out at a nearby college, Andr√© volunteered to nurse. Not one person died. The trickle of sick people to his door became a flood. His superiors were uneasy; diocesan authorities were suspicious; doctors called him a quack. "I do not cure," he said again and again. "Saint Joseph cures." In the end he needed four secretaries to handle the 80,000 letters he received each year."
Let us be inspired by St Andr√© who in a true sense was a doorkeeper at the house of the Lord, the Lord uses the weak things of this world to do great Miracles.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### David's Prayer of Thanksgiving

[![David's Prayer of Thanksgiving](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day140.jpg)](https://youtu.be/55xHDdJ_bDU "David's Prayer of Thanksgiving")

##### Day #140 ‚ÄúYour help made me great‚Äù

David has been through a lot in his life, his life has been a roller-coaster ride, sometimes he is up and sometimes down. He was a courageous young man - one after God‚Äôs own heart, who defended his sheep from the wild animals, the brave boy who slain the giant, the harp player that dove out evil spirits, the brave soldier who slay ten thousands, he was the great king of Israel that won many battles and a prefiguration of Jesus the King of Kings. He also has his moments of weakness where he multiplied wives and concubines, gave into sloth, lusted, and committed murder, the most important thing is that he knew how to repent from his heart. Every time he went down, he prayed and repented and came right back up. He was perused many times to be killed by King Saul and even his own son Absalom. He is now too weak to go to battle escaped death by a whisker. What made King David great was not his victories or his failures but his unfailing trust in the help that came from the Lord. Another translation of the Greek word is ‚ÄúGentleness‚Äù - we are need God‚Äôs compassion and mercy ‚Äì if God is not gentle and quick to judge us, we will not stand a chance. If our sins were numbered we will be long gone.

Let us also hold on to the Lord and seek his help and gentleness. We should be able to proclaim like David, that
‚ÄúThe lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God my rock in whom I take refuge‚Äù 2 Sam 22:2-3

We should remember that the battle belongs to the Lord, just how young boy David went up to fight the Philistine with pebbles. We should go up to fight our battles with the pebbles of the rosary, which are the mysteries of Jesus‚Äô life. As we pray on our beeds, we can slain the giants in our lives.

Because our God is not distant or passive, but He is active always ready to come to our aid.

‚ÄúHe bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet. He rode on a cherub and flew he was seen upon the winds of the wind.‚Äù 2Sam 22: 11-12

Let us like David at the end of our lives be in a place where we can proclaim that the Lord is faithful and our entire life is dependent on Him. He was the one who helped us and moved us through every difficulty and sin. God is our ever present help in trouble, and that we will be rewarded with Heaven. I hope and pray at the end of our lives which have been like a roller-coaster ride, we will be able to say ‚ÄúYour help/gentleness made me great‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #141 Are you guarding your bean field?

David‚Äôs 3 Mighty Men are Josheb-basshebeth, Eleazar and Shammah.
Josheb-basshebeth he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time
(I mean Wow ‚Äì try to imagine it - killing 800 men at once)
Eleazar ‚Äì He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew, but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword.
(Wow ‚Äì Even though the whole army of Israel withdrew he stood his ground ‚Äì to the point that his hand got stuck to the sword ‚Äì may be due to the heat (metal hits metal) his skin stuck to the sword)
Shammah - Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines. 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory.
What struck me the most was Shammah guarding the field of lentils. He did not move he defended the plot from the Philistines. He stood in the center of the field and defended it until the Philistines fled it. Not all of us are called to do great things like to fight until the sword sticks to our hand or killing 800 men. We may be called to guard the bean field, guard our family. No matter what happens we need to stand our ground and protect our children against everything that comes their way. Never think that our task is too small or insignificant, we are all given different tasks. Take care of your little bean field, do small tasks like keeping the house tidy, doing the dishes, or picking up the kids. These small tasks done with dedication can save lives. Our God is excited when we guard our little bean field, He takes delight when he sees us caring for the people under our care.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 141 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 23:15-17
*David said longingly, ‚ÄúO that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!‚Äù Then the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the Lord, for he said, ‚ÄúThe Lord forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?‚Äù Therefore he would not drink it.*

If David would have drunk the water and satisfied his desire to taste the water of his hometown, this act would probably not have been recorded in the Bible and preachers would not have mentioned it. But David did not want to selfishly enjoy the water which was obtained by the sacrifice of his men.

Like us, Jesus too had a life, but He did not spend His life fulfilling His own desires. He did not focus on His own comfort or luxury. He spent His life caring for others.
As followers of Christ we must live our lives like Him.

When we keep all God given gifts and blessings for ourselves and for our families without sharing with others, those gifts turn into our pride because we are satisfying only our own desires. Like Jesus, we must go outside our small world, reach out to the needy ones around us, and share whatever we can with them.

##### Whole and Joyful Hearts

[![Whole and Joyful Hearts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day142.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BJa4n5S_xGc "Whole and Joyful Hearts")

##### Day 142 Giving Freely and whole heartily

David has the greatest relief at the end of his life, he was the King of Israel, the shepherd that led the people. He struggled with sin and committed some big ones, however, he repented and was forgiven. His greatest desire was for the House of the Lord and the presence of the Lord. Because of His multiples sins and because he was a man with bloodshed on his hands, the Lord did not permit him to build something that is holy, the temple. However, God chose one of his sons, Solomon, to do this. Solomon was young and inexperienced, so David was concerned as a father. He now opens his heart and his treasure ‚Äì he keeps on giving ‚Äì if we try to add up what he offered to the Lord, it would be Thousands of Billions of $$$ in our current currency.
He knew for a fact that everything that he has was from the Lord, he was a young shepherd boy with nothing when the Lord called him to be King. David would have felt such joy when he pledges a lot of his riches to the building of the temple. But the real joy would have come from seeing everyone else open up their heart to giving towards the temple. David led by example and everyone followed.
In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‚ÄòIt is more blessed to give than to receive.‚Äô‚ÄùActs 20:35
It must have been such a good feeling for all of them. For it's more blessed to give than to receive. The realization that they had about all their wealth was actually what the Lord gave them, their ancestors were first slaves and then desert wanderers, the Lord brought them into the promised land, flowing with Milk and Honey.
When David asked the reason they replied as below:
‚ÄúBut who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 1 Cr 29:14-16
Let us also learn from them and realize that nothing that we have is our own, we have received it from the hands of the Lord. Let us be cheerful givers who give wholeheartedly of our time, talent, and treasure.
6 The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:6-7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 142 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 24:18 & 25
*On the same day Gad went to David and said to him, ‚ÄúGo and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.*
*Then David built an altar to the LORD there, and sacrificed burnt offerings and communion offerings. The LORD granted relief to the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.*

Satan put a thought in David‚Äôs mind to take a census of Israel to locate able bodied men capable of using the sword so that he could increase the strength of his physical army (1 Chronicles 21:1-5). Therefore without consulting the Lord, David took a census of his people. This made the Lord very angry so He sent a plague among David‚Äôs people. Thereafter David was asked to sacrifice burnt offerings and communion offerings in atonement for his sin and the plague was withdrawn.

Very often Satan instigates us too to make choices to satisfy our will which would be against God‚Äôs Will. Satan‚Äôs offers are always very juicy and we therefore choose to ignore God‚Äôs Will and go ahead according to our will, thus bringing suffering upon ourselves and our families. When we realize our errors we must repent and confess our sins without delay and ensure to avoid making such choices.

*Why was Saul's sacrifice rejected by God (1 Samuel 13:13) but David‚Äôs sacrifice accepted?*

Both Saul and David offered sacrifices which only the Levitical priests had authority to do, but David (a non-Levite) also exercised a priesthood, and his priesthood was passed on to his sons (2 Samuel 8:18). David was known to have done other priestly acts during his lifetime which only the Levitical priests had authority to do (example : wearing the priestly Ephod, taking care of the Ark, offering sacrifices, blessing the people in the name of the Lord) (2 Samuel 6:14-15 & 17-18) because God permitted it through the Prophet Gad (2 Samuel 24:18).

Saul, however, was not permitted to perform any priestly duties.

*But why did God permit David to perform priestly duties?*

When David conquered Jerusalem and sat on the throne (2 Samuel 5:5), he actually succeeded the previous king of Salem (Melchizedek) who was also a priest (Genesis 14:18). Thus David opened the door and paved the way for the priesthood of the Judah tribe, to the order of Melchizedek, which later, Jesus, son of David, would hand over to His apostles to make it universal as God had originally desired (Exodus 19:6).

Like David, Jesus was also 30 years old when he became king and priest (2 Samuel 5:4).
At Jerusalem, David reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years (2 Samuel 5:5), which was the full span of the life of Jesus, son of David, and King of the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 24:24
*‚ÄúI will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.‚Äù*

David wanted to buy that place to offer his sacrifice. Araunah was not going to charge David anything, but David insisted on paying for it. He did not want to offer God anything that cost him nothing.

It is easy to serve God when we give our excess.
Sacrificing to God means that it must cost us something.
We can sacrifice our hearts and time to do God‚Äôs work. He wants people to give themselves to Him, willingly and completely. He wants their time and their abilities to do His work.
To sacrifice something means to give up something we love the most or something that we are attached to. It must cost us something, otherwise it is not really a sacrifice.
We can sacrifice our entertainment time to serve God or we can give up our children to the service of God (religious). We can share what we have with the less fortunate ones even if we have to do with less.

We have to decide on what and how much we are willing to give God.

##### Day 143 Asking God for the right things

We read this very famous event where Solomon asks for wisdom. At night God appears to Solomon and said ‚ÄúAsk what I shall give thee.‚Äù Solomon‚Äôs answered
10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 2 Ch 1:10
God was so pleased with Solomon‚Äôs answer.
11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. 2Ch 1: 11-12
Solomon received wisdom but that did not automatically make him perfect, it just made him wise. Now wisdom can be used for good or bad, he uses it to do things that the Lord did not command. Like, amass horses and chariots and horses from Egpyt.
There are two lessons to learn here, Asking for the right things in prayer and being obedient to God‚Äôs commands, or else all our talents and efforts are in vain.
Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge from the Lord and everything else was added on like riches, wealth, and honor. In the same way, we need to seek first the Kingdom of God and everything else will be added on. When we pray we should ask for God‚Äôs presence, love, and mercy in our lives, every other thing will be added in.
Some people when they pray are only praying prayers of petition and request, some even are trying to make a deal with the Lord and say ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you answer this prayer, I will do this good deed‚Äù we should not worry too much about earthly things -they will be added on when we ask for Jesus himself. If you have the King ‚Äì the whole kingdom will be granted.

But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Mat 6:33
Let us ask God for wisdom and understanding, not just that but the grace to live a life according to his calling and his Word.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 143 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 1:38
*So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites went down, and mounting Solomon on King David‚Äôs mule, escorted him to Gihon. Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram‚Äôs horn and all the people shouted, ‚ÄúLong live King Solomon!‚Äù*

This was a foreshadow of Jesus, the King of the heavenly Davidic Kingdom, riding a donkey when he entered Jerusalem (traditionally known as Palm Sunday) and the people followed him greeting him with palms and shouting with joy ‚ÄúHosanna to the son of David.‚Äù

Riding a donkey was a sign of humility and David wanted to show the people that Solomon was a humble king, as opposed to Adonijah who was a warrior.

##### Day #144 Queen Mother

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus‚Äô dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1
May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are ‚ÄúI am a handmaid of the Lord‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDo as he says, listen to him‚Äù. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 144 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 2:13-22
In the earthly Davidic kingdom of the old Covenant, when Solomon, son of David, was crowned king, he had a throne kept at his right, for the queen, and the queen was his mother, not his wife. Thereafter, in Judea, every king had a queen and, by default, the queen was always the king‚Äôs mother, not his wife. Solomon‚Äôs mother held a regal office in the kingdom. She was known as the ‚ÄúGebirah‚Äù (the ‚ÄúGreat Lady‚Äù or ‚ÄúQueen Mother‚Äù).

This was a fore shadow or prototype of the new Covenant kingdom.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom of the new Covenant, Jesus is the King. Therefore, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom, His mother becomes the Queen, by default and she would sit on a throne at the right hand of her son, Christ the King.

Most of the petitions from the people would come to King Solomon through his mother, who was the intercessor between the king and the people. The petitions presented by the Queen Mother were given first preference by the royal son, but the decision always rested with the royal son.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the intercessor between God‚Äôs people and her royal Son. Jesus will always give first preference to the petitions presented by His Queen Mother.

Bathsheba‚Äôs petition was, however, rejected by King Solomon because she took an ungodly petition to him.

Jesus will never reject His mother‚Äôs petitions. He will always grant the petitions presented by His mother, having lived His earthly life with her for 33 years and knowing fully well that His mother would never ask Him to do something against God‚Äôs Will. The same mother, who at a young age was ready to go through suffering, and sacrificed her only Son to save the world, in obedience to God‚Äôs Will; the same mother who taught Him to live His life according to God‚Äôs Will so that God was very pleased with Him. We have an earthly example of this when Mary took the people‚Äôs petition to her Son during the wedding at Cana (John 2:3) but she insisted on the people obeying her Son (John 2:5).

Therefore, whether we ask Mary for spiritual gifts, or material gifts, or to help us through our sufferings, etc. she will take our petitions to her Son only if our request is in accordance with God‚Äôs Will.

Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all the rest will be given unto you (Matthew 6:33).

##### Day #145 Doing things with great precision

Just love the way King Solomon executes the blueprint that was handed down to him for the building of the temple. He is doing everything with great precision just as the Lord had instructed, silver where silver was needed, gold where old was needed, all the furniture fittings, the lampstands, the list goes on. Followed the prescribed way of transporting the ark of the covenant, the Levities/priests carried it.
When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. 2 Ch 5: 4,5
The Lord was very pleased with the dedication Solomon showed towards the building of the temple. The Lord was very pleased with the Israelites, for they had earlier opened their hearts to give towards the temple. We know the Lord was very pleased because of the cloud of smoke that filled the temple, which is an indication of the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord was so strong in the temple that because of the smoke the priest could not perform their duties.
Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud, and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God. 2 Ch 5: 14
King Solomon did that one great thing that the Lord was calling him to do. Did it with great dedication and precision.
What is the Lord calling me to do today? What is that one thing that the Lord is calling you to do? Maybe more than one great thing or one small thing or a bunch of little things that the Lord is calling you to do.
Maybe you are called to share God‚Äôs word, be a musician or singer for the Lord, be a Eucharistic Minister or Usher, Maybe God wants you to be a priest or religious, maybe you are called to do charity or be part of service ministry by feeding the poor, maybe you're called to be a good listener, a good husband or wife, a good parent, maybe your called to be a good example at your workplace.
It's up to us to identify our calling, we should listen carefully and seek God‚Äôs plan. Once we know our calling, we should do it with great dedication and precision. We should never lose sight of our goal, keep moving on, and with God‚Äôs help achieve it.
‚ÄúGod does not call us to be successful, He calls us to be faithful. Faithfulness and dedication are success even if we do not achieve what we want‚Äù

##### Day #146 Let your faith life exceed the Sunday obligation

We know that King Solomon built the temple with great precision, and it pleased the Lord. But the building is not everything, dedicating it and active sacrifice followed. The Temple was established as the central place to worship, everyone needed to go up there to worship. This caused a lot of activity and a lot of prayer and sacrifice, a lot of celebration, atonement for sins, and spending time in the presence of the Lord. King Solomon was instrumental in really getting the people together and united in prayer for the Lord. The amount of food that was offered and prepared there was enormous, showing a sign of how active the temple was.
The temple was full of life and abundance. Just like the temple described in Ezekiel where the river flowing from the temple brought life wherever it went.
Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there. It will become fresh; and everything will live where the river goes. Ez 47:9
We can compare two things to the temple of God

1. Our Parish

2. Our faith lives

Our Parish should be a place of refuge, a place for prayer and worship of God, and a place where the sacrifice of the Mass is offered. There is something about getting dressed and leaving our homes to go to a central place for worship, it puts our hearts in the right state to worship God ‚Äì opposed to saying I‚Äôm just going to stay in my PJs and pray in my room. The church is a place for community worship, a central place where we can join our brothers and sisters in Christ. It‚Äôs not about how good the building looks, a posh church in the developed world can seem dull as compared to a shack of a building in a third world country ‚Äì what matters are the people and their faith, not the building. I am so blessed to be part of a very active parish ‚Äì the building is beautiful and so is the faith community. My advice ‚Äì find one or make your parish into one.
Our faith lives should go beyond the Sunday obligation, the bare minimum. If you take lessons to learn an instrument once a week and do not practice all week, you will never progress you will be stuck in a rut. In the same way, we cannot just survive on the Sunday Obligation, just offering 1 hour a week to God will not get you anywhere.
We are the temple of God now in the New Testament, our hearts need to be active and vibrant ‚Äì constantly abiding in the presence of the Lord. By doing the BIAY we are already beyond that basic stage, dedicating 20-30 mins every day is truly something that you should be proud about. But it does not stop here, we should continue to practice the presence of the Lord in our lives, praising him always and praying unceasingly. The River of the Holy Spirit should flow from our hearts bringing life to everyone we encounter.
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 1 Cor 6:19
Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-18
Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them. John 7:38
Let us go beyond the Sunday obligation to the point where we are becoming the temple of God, constantly praying, rejoicing and the springs of living waters, the Holy Spirit will flow from our hearts.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day #147 He will heal our land

This question has been asked repeatedly through the centuries. Whenever there is an evil act such as a shooting, war, or rape. One usually asks where was God when this evil was happening.
There are times when children are harmed or the venerable are hurt. The question Where was God? This question is trying to show God as incapable of action or not in control of things.
However, the question to ask is why has humanity come to this? God is not the one who is committing evil, the evil starts in human hearts and turns into actions.
God is working with fallen humans, he is trying to get us to the right path, to walk in Jesus‚Äôs steps. Through the centuries of sin, evil, and hatred God is slowly teaching us, humans, the right path. Step by step and little by little.
God gives us the freedom to choose Good over evil, he has always given us freedom starting with Adam and Eve, but we keep choosing evil. It‚Äôs human weakness that has caused so much evil in the world today. However no matter how many times we fail as humans; God invites us, again and again, to repent and go back to him. So that he can restore us back to what we are called to be.
God invites us again as he invited the Israelites under King Solomon.
if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Ch 7:14
We desperately need God‚Äôs healing in our homes, towns, cities, and countries. Let us be united in prayer as we seek God‚Äôs face and as we repent and ask the Lord to forgive us. If we sincerely pray and repent, we will have heaven on earth. God will hear us from heaven forgive our sins and heal our land.
Also remember if we ask God to act with force towards those who commit evil, it will be unbearable and we will be afraid of God. God does not want us to follow him out of fear but out of love.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 147 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Chronicles 7:12-15
\*The LORD appeared to Solomon during the night and said to him, ‚ÄúI have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for my house of sacrifice.‚Äù\*

In the old Covenant God chose the Temple for the prescribed sacrifices to be offered to Him.
In the new Covenant God has chosen the Church for the prescribed sacrifice to be offered to Him.

\*The LORD said to Solomon, ‚ÄúIf I close heaven so that there is no rain, if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, if then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land.\*

God gave Solomon a warning regarding the consequences which he and his people would have to face if they disobeyed God‚Äôs commandments. But since God is merciful He gave Solomon the solution as well, on how they could overcome the consequences.

But this warning was not only for Solomon and his people. It is valid for all generations until the end of time.

God is fully aware of whatever sicknesses, disasters, problems, etc. we face on individual level, local level or global level. He may have allowed it as a test for our faith or most likely due to the increase of the mortal sins of Christians, the ones on whom His name has been pronounced (during baptism). God does not allow evil unless He can draw some good from it.

During such times God does not wait for us to wake Him up and tell Him to stop or change what is happening. He waits for us to repent, confess our sins and ensure that our souls are sanctified. He waits for us to come back to Him and build a relationship with Him.

Let us therefore ensure to repent, confess our sins and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that a misfortune may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death.

On the other hand, if we are leading holy lives according to God‚Äôs Will, then we can continue as we are and we don‚Äôt have to worry about the destiny of our souls in the event of unexpected death.

\*Now, therefore, my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place; for now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart shall be there always.\*

God heard every prayer that went up from the Temple, and God hears every prayer that goes up from the Church as well, but His answer to our prayers will always come in His time, not in the time we expect.

In the old Covenant, God dwelt in the Temple in His divinity.
In the new Covenant, God dwells in the Church in His humanity in the Bread of life / Eucharist, and will continue until the end of time.

2 Chronicles 8:4-8
As commanded by God, the sinful Canaanites were supposed to be driven out of the land or destroyed completely but Solomon didn't do anything like that. Instead he was very soft with them. Besides imposing heavy taxes on them he didn't make any attempt to get rid of them. The Canaanites gradually re-introduced idolatry in the country and the Israelites started living sinful lives under their influence thus bringing disaster upon themselves.

Sometimes we too fail to uproot the small sins in our daily lives and we become comfortable living with them. We gradually start convincing ourselves that it is okay to continue as long as we are not harming anyone. Those small sins then gradually progress to mortal sins and we don't even realize when we started walking hand in hand with the devil, thus bringing eternal disaster upon ourselves. Therefore, however small a sin may be, it is always wiser to "nip it in the bud" by making a firm decision to stop it immediately, before it is too late.

##### Solomon's Wealth

[![Solomon's Wealth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day148.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kmIvP9xPs4E "Solomon's Wealth")

##### Day #148 Enter the Holy of Holies.

As we read through the construction details of the temple, one cannot help but put on sunglasses to look at the temple. It‚Äôs loaded with Gold, tailor-cut stone, and all the fittings, and finishing are of the best quality. If it was still around it would have easily beat the Taj Mahal to the 7 wonders of the world. Picture the most splendid buildings that you have ever seen, and it would fail in splendor to the temple that Solomon built, Solomon was just an instrument the blueprint was given by the Lord.
Even though the temple was ‚Äúout of this world‚Äù it fails in comparison to what Jesus did for us.
In the OT when people made a pilgrimage to the temple to offer sacrifice, they would not be able to go into the holy of holies. They had to visit the temple courts and pray, offer their sacrifice and leave. Only select priests would be able to go into the holy of Holies.
Jesus our new High priest made a way for us, He is both the priest and the sacrifice, He offered himself once and for all. He opened the way for, He is the gate that we can enter to go to the promised land. When Jesus gave up His spirit, the veil of the temple was torn.
Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. Mat 27:50-51
The curtains/veil was the section that separated the common area to the Holy of Holies. Jesus by His life death and resurrection ‚Äì atones for our sins. The tearing of the curtains can be considered symbolic that Jesus made a way for us to enter the Holy of Holies. He gives us full access to God, to the Holy Trinity. We are allowed to enter the Holy of Holies ‚Äì the sanctuary where Jesus is present in the truest form. We no longer must stay outside the temple; we are welcome to go close to Jesus ‚Äì into His presence. In the Holy of Holies of the New Testament, we have Jesus‚Äôs consecrated body ‚Äì He is truly present in each host ‚Äì body blood soul, and divinity (transubstantiation).
Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
Heb 10:19 -20
The next time we enter the church remember that it is such a gift to be able to just walk into the Holy of Holies. Let me say it again ‚ÄúIT IS SUCH A GIFT‚Äù. The price that was paid for our entry into the Holy of Holies is very high, Jesus‚Äôs life death, and resurrection. Let us go rejoicing into Church knowing that we are welcome, we are chosen and God wants us close to Him. The Holy Eucharist even though it looks simple, is spiritually enriching and the brightest and most radiant as it is Jesus, the Light of the world. The temple in all its splendor is just an icon/ a symbol of the every brilliant Jesus. If see all His splendor we will become blind like Saul-Paul, that is why Jesus has pity on us and we are able to look at the host in bread form although it is fully Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 148 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 6:7
*The Temple was built of stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or axe or iron tool was heard in the Temple during its construction.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ (John 2:21; Revelation 21:22) therefore God did not want any tool to be used on the Temple site because the Body of Christ was to be scourged and crucified only once.
Also, God does not dwell in noisy places. God dwells only where there is silence (1 Kings 19:12-13), therefore the construction of the Temple was done with minimum noise.

The stones represent Christians who are like cells in the Body of Christ.
The stones needed to be cut and shaped at the quarry, away from the Temple, till they would be good enough to become part of the Temple.

Similarly, when Christians go away from Christ, because of their mortal sins, they need to be purified through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) outside of the Mass, before they can receive the Eucharist (Communion) (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) to become part of the Body of Christ again.

1 Kings 6:38
King Solomon built the Temple exactly as per the specifications given by God to King David. If Solomon had modified the specifications to suit his whims and fancies, he would have been disobeying God‚Äôs command and that would have been a disaster because it would have displeased the Lord. But because he followed every detail which God had given to King David, God was pleased with Solomon and God came to dwell in the Temple. Solomon‚Äôs Temple therefore came to be known as the most magnificent work, such as was never seen before, because it was the work of human hands done with divine inspiration.

Similarly, the Word of God (the Bible) has been written by human authors with divine inspiration. Any modification to the Word of God will be a disaster for those who modify it.

##### DAY 148 by Sheila

In the Book of Kings, Solomon's Temple, so beautiful was the fulfillment of God's Promise to make a place for His Name to dwell and to give lsrael her own Country a permanent place to Worship God.
The Cherubims were Angels to reflect God's Glory, The Inner Sanctuary, The Most Holy Place, The Presence of God's Dwelling.
Chronicle reveals the Wealth, Wisdom and Extent of Solomon's Kingdom with tremendous Worldwide Recognition.
But Solomon led astray personally, his pagan wives, his entire family was corrupted not following God's Law. The Death of Solomon, was buried with his fathers in the City of David.
The Psalm is of faith and trust in God.. Sacrifices of Righteousness are those offered with the right attitude and God's protection comes to those who put their hope and trust in God.

##### All Is Vanity

[![All Is Vanity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day149.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iblNnsD_p5E "All Is Vanity")

##### Day #149 All is vanity

I‚Äôm sure we have come across people who have burnt out their lives trying to amass wealth, houses, cars‚Ä¶ We have seen some perusing fame and popularity ‚Äì doing anything to be on top. We have seen many who try to leave a legacy when they die. Those who want to enjoy all the pleasures that money can buy. None of those will bring us lasting joy, even if we get all the money in the world, all the pleasures in this world, even if we are the most popular person in town. We will not be satisfied. Let me say it again ‚ÄúNothing of this world will satisfy us‚Äù. We have seen so many of the rich and famous commit suicide. Most of them need to be on meds/drugs and are depressed.
We read the story of the King who had it all, all the wealth, wisdom, legacy, pleasures but all of it was but a wind, a vapor, all is vanity.
This King gathered silver and gold, and slaves, built houses, bought vineyards, had singers, wine, and concubines, he had all the wisdom under the sun. The outcome is this piece of wisdom.
‚ÄúThen I considered all that my hands had done and the toils I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun‚Äù Ecc 2:11
If our life was going to end here on earth, then it would be so unsatisfactory. All the things we gather, all the experiences, all the toil, all the pleasures, nothing is long-lasting ‚Äì it will all get blown away in the wind.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mk 8:36
Our life does not end here on earth, our destination is heaven. Live this life focused on the next and you will be satisfied, our focus should be to live a life that pleases God.
‚ÄúFor to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy‚Äù Ecc 2:26
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![The Dedication of the Temple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day150.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z01qQFrR49k "The Dedication of the Temple")

##### Day #150 A time for everything

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:
a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
Just reading this scripture brings so much peace. In our earthly lives, we will face different situations, phases, seasons, and experiences. One does not have to be smiling all the time, there are times when we will mourn when we will be silent, we are called to have joy ‚Äì joy is that inner peace that will not leave us even if we are going through a storm. The inner peace that knows that God is in control.
Everything will eventually pass away, if everything is going right in your life now, it will go away and you will have problems and worries. If you‚Äôre having problems and worries that will also pass and you will have peace. Our life is a rollercoaster ride, we will go through difficulties and happiness, peace and war, time to move, and time to stay. But the one thing that will never change is God. God is the same forever, He will never change.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.Heb 13:8
The best way to ride the waves of life is to stay close to Jesus. Jesus never changes He is always the same and is always next to us. It is important to mourn when we lose a loved one. It is important to move on sometimes in our life. It is important to take on new opportunities and do new things. It is also important to hold onto things that are good. It is important to hold onto good relationships and to discard those that are not beneficial for you. (the goal is that we all grow closer to God as we learn to love each other)
Keep moving forwards knowing that Jesus is the same and He is with you. Right now it's time to rejoice because you completed reading 150 days of the Bible. Hurray!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 150 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 8:10-11
The Lord came down to dwell with His people in Solomon‚Äôs Temple in the form of a glory cloud.

In the new Covenant the Lord comes down to dwell in the Tabernacle with His people.

1 Kings 8:17-19
*My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. But the Lord said to my father David, ‚ÄòYou did well to consider building a house for my name; nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.‚Äô*

David had a strong desire to build a house / Temple for the Lord but he was not allowed to build it, so his son Solomon faithfully fulfilled his desire and God was pleased with Solomon.

When we have a desire to do something in life but we are unable to do it due to unavoidable circumstances, we feel so happy to see our children dedicating themselves to fulfill our dreams.
But do we, God's children, think of dedicating ourselves to fulfill the desire of our heavenly Father to help the growth of His Kingdom (the Church) on earth?

##### Wisdom and Folly

[![Wisdom and Folly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day151.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NrL3YU5CSJc "Wisdom and Folly")

##### Day #151 Do not pay attention to every word people say

‚ÄúDo not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you‚Äî for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.‚Äù Ecc 7:21-22
This is excellent advice to our very self-obsessed generation. Compared to the previous generations, we have become very self-conscious about what others think about us. We care too much about others' opinions, sometimes we can go to the extent of shaping our lives based on what people think.
We are worried that our neighbor's lawn is greener than ours, that our friends are making more money than us, that our siblings are more successful than us, and we are afraid to wear certain clothes as it makes us look thick(see I had to think before writing fat). We are so concerned that our phones are the latest model and that are cars are posh enough.
‚ÄúWhat do people think of me?‚Äù has even entered the spiritual circles. We hear homilies that are sweet and politically correct.
We seldom hear homilies spoken with conviction that causes people to repent (Although there have been homilies that have cut to the heart and caused me to repent) We do not hear the call to repentance as we read it in the Gospel. Like Peter preached on Pentecost ‚ÄúSave yourselves from this crooked generation!‚Äù and we do not hear that response ‚ÄúWhat should we do to be saved‚Äù.
We all try to be so pious and good in front of others but are gossiping and slandering our very ‚Äúso-called‚Äù spiritual friends behind their back. We need to break ourselves free from the shackles that cause us to portray a perfect picture of ourselves. We need to realize that we are all broken, all are fallen and in need of a savior. Let us not be overly concerned about what others think of us, God looks into our hearts and knows us through and through.
Let us shout it out from the rooftops, and tell everyone not to be concerned about what others think.
‚ÄúSave yourselves from this crooked generation!‚Äù Acts 2:40
Just live the best life you can. What others think about us is their problem.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. ‚úåÔ∏è

1 Kings 9:10-13
The Solomonic Temple was designed by God, revealed to David (in a dream) who handed it over to Solomon to construct it. However, the actual construction of the Temple was carried out by the laborers of Hiram, the prince of Tyre, who was not only a gentile but a descendant of the Canaanites.

At Sinai, God's people were commanded to avoid the gentile Canaanites.

At Zion, God's people hired the gentile Canaanites to help them in building God's Temple and Solomon later gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

Thus, by uniting the Jews and the gentiles politically and geographically, Solomon was gradually moving towards the reversal of Babel which would finally be fulfilled on Pentecost Sunday.

##### Being Forgotten

[![Being Forgotten](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day152.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wrYUXll61KM "Being Forgotten")

##### Day #152 The living know they will die, and the dead know nothing.

‚ÄúThe living know they will die, and the dead know nothing.‚Äù Ecc 9:5
One of the best revelations that one can receive is the fact that we are just sojourners on earth.
This is not our destination; this is the road that we are to travel. Our citizenship is in heaven or hell, our goal in the earthly life is to get to heaven and take as many as we can.
For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven. Ph 3:18
Both Ecclesiastics and St Paul are sorting people into two categories. Those who are only concerned about the earthly life and those who are focused on the next life. We can see those who live for their bellies and the vain glory. Those who are laser-focused on this earthly life and everything that it has to offer. Their destiny is destruction ‚Äì they will never find satisfaction on earth no matter how much of earthly things they receive. They live life as though there is no tomorrow, like they will never die. Just living in the moment and chasing after everything that glitters.
On the other hand, those who know they will die. Those are the ones who say this world and all its things are passing away. We will die and will be forgotten. All their actions and thoughts are in preparation for the next world. With the focus on the next world, we will experience heaven on earth. For we stop focusing on the earthly stuff we have, the stuff we need, our temporary earthly suffering rather learn life lessons from them.
One self-test that we can do is to list all our prayers and sort into two categories, prayers for this world vs prayers for next world.
For Ex: Prayer for this world - physical healing, finances {Note: these are genuine prayers and should be prayed}
Prayers for the next world ‚Äì prayers for breakthrough from sin, prayers for the fruits of the Spirit, for wisdom.
As we list out the prayers we may be able to see if we are focused on this world or the next.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### The Decline of Solomon

[![The Decline of Solomon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day153.jpg)](https://youtu.be/P16j_E54TVU "The Decline of Solomon")

##### Day #153 Choosing the right life partner

We see that the wisest man ever, King Solomon has been fooled. He who started off well, listening to God‚Äôs voice and building the great temple and praying for the right things ‚Äì for ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. He knew the wise thing to do and experienced the Lord speaking to him several times in his life, yet he was fooled and mislead by his wives. He had too many of them, 700 wives and 300 concubines. They lead him astray to worship their gods.
Solomon loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter‚ÄîMoabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, ‚ÄúYou must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.‚Äù
As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 1 King 11
Solomon the wisest person should have known that these gods of his wives were simply evil as their worship included child sacrifice and many other evil practices. Also, Solomon was going against the commands of the Lord to not marry women from those places.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord‚Äôs command. 1 Kings 11:9-10
It is a terrible ending that we read about, the wisest man ever has been fooled. His heart is closed to the Lord‚Äôs warnings and at the lowest point of his life.
It is not just wisdom that we need but the will to do the right thing as well.
Like Solomon, we can mess up our lives if we marry the wrong person. We need to be very discerning and careful about the spouse we pick. Marry someone who loves the Lord and is rooted and grounded in the Lord. Go through a discernment process to see if it‚Äôs the Lord‚Äôs plan for the two of you.
Who can find a worthy wife? She is far more precious than pearls.
Her husband entrusts his heart to her, for in her he has an unfailing blessing. Prov 31:10-11
Some very good advice to wives and applies to husbands as well.
Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing; rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God‚Äôs sight. 1 Pet 3:1-5
So when you look for your spouse don‚Äôt only look for looks or jewelry or clothing. Look at how they conduct themselves, look for a genuine spirit and a gentle spirit that loves the Lord. Remember that the Lord has someone in store for you, seek His will.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 153 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 11:1-13
Marriages were designed by God for a God-centered couple (1 man & 1 woman) to raise a family with love. The purpose of the marriage was never supposed to be for personal gain. It is a life-time covenantal relationship. When God or love or couple are missing in the marriage, or the purpose is ungodly, then blessings don‚Äôt pour in.

Solomon started off very well with God-centeredness, couple marriage and love. In his earlier years Solomon may have loved every single of his wife and he may have been worshipping the living God to keep Him happy, but unfortunately, Solomon‚Äôs purpose for the marriage was not love; it was to gain political alliances (1 Kings 3:1). He did not maintain the covenantal oath of a marriage to be faithful to one spouse, and in his latter years he even stopped being God-centered. Just as he multiplied his wives, he also multiplied his gods.

God had patience with Solomon and spared him for the sake of his father, King David, but his descendants had to bear the consequences of his sins (Exodus 20:3-5) and therefore, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was torn apart because God left them, and Rehoboam turned out to be worse than his father Solomon.

Let us make sure we don‚Äôt follow the errors of Solomon in our married lives or else our children may have to bear the consequences of our sins.

The three restrictions given in the Mosaic Law for the future kings was that they must not multiply their Wealth, Weapons and Wives (Deut. 17:14).
But Solomon broke all three articles of the Law by multiplying his Wealth (1 Kings 10:14), Weapons (1 Kings 10:26) and Wives (1 Kings 11:3).
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue (1 Kings 10:28) and married pagan women from the neighboring pagan countries which God had forbidden them from marrying. The pagan wives later turned Solomon‚Äôs heart away from God by making him worship their false gods. Solomon loved his wives and therefore in order to please them He displeased the Lord.

*When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other false gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord his God.*

In the Garden of Eden, Eve shared the forbidden fruit with Adam, for a false god, and turned his heart away from the Lord his God.

##### The Baptism of Jesus

[![The Baptism of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day154.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9xPADpXjRUY "The Baptism of Jesus")

##### Day #154 Holy Trinity

As we begin our Messianic Checkpoint with St Mark‚Äôs Gospel. It seems that it‚Äôs a rapid-fire Gospel, as it is the shortest and has fast-moving scenes. Although we can spend years contemplating the mysteries revealed, Mark keeps us moving along with the style of his writing and the repeated use of the word ‚ÄúImmediately‚Äù
The opening scene is John the Baptist preaching a message of repentance and people were getting baptized in the River Jordan. Immediately the focus shifts to Jesus, Jesus is revealed following the words ‚ÄúI have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit‚Äù
Just in the blink of an eye, we see Jesus being baptized. Rather than run with the speed of Mark let us stay here and absorb it all.
First of all, why did Jesus need to be baptized if He is God, did the water purify Him? No he was baptized just to show us the way, His baptism revealed his identity as the Son of God and He did not need to be purified but when he touched the water the waters were made Holy, just as when the unclean leaper(/the women with the flow of blood) touched Him he was not made unclean but they were made clean and whole.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.‚Äù Mark 1: 9
Given that St Marks' Gospel was the very first account of the Gospel, we are reading for the very first time the obvious revelation of the Holy Trinity. We are introduced to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the same scene. All three are divine, and all three are one God. One God ‚Äì three persons.
First of all, this is a mystery and we cannot ever fully understand a mystery. What we need to do is enter into the mystery and experience it, we cannot solve it.
It‚Äôs not a math problem, we cannot say that this math equation ‚Äú1X1X1 = 1‚Äù solves the Trinity equation.
It‚Äôs more of a who God is a thing. We have a Triune God. Father-Son-Spirit who are equal in all aspects and divine in all aspects, totally united and one.
Jesus is not created by the Father, they are of the same substance so to speak, and hence begotten, Jesus is not made, Jesus is not one of the creations that were created in the beginning when the Spirit of God hovered over the void world. There were all present even before creation, for at creation we see the conversation - "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness" and the Holy Spirit hover over the void.
When it comes to the Holy Trinity the best way to understand it is to enter into it. Enter into the mystery and discover it. To fall in love with God, the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the ‚Äúmysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.‚Äù To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel‚Äôs faith before the Incarnation of God‚Äôs Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (CCC 237)
The mystery of the Holy Trinity could be one thing that Jesus said to the disciples ‚ÄúI have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now‚Ä¶‚Äù and promised the Holy Spirit ‚Äúhe will guide you into all the truth‚Äù (16:13). The Church was guided to understand God as Triune.
Let us ask the Holy Spirit to lead us into the mystery of the Holy Trinity ‚Äì Father, Son, and Spirit. So we could be one with God - just as the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.
May the Holy Spirit lead usüôè

##### DAY 154 By Sheila

Today's Study on John the Baptist centered on two messages: The repentance of sins and the Person of Jesus Christ.

At the Baptism of Jesus, The Presence of the Trinity is emphasized. Jesus The Son Of Flesh, The Holy Spirit in the form of a Dove and The Father whose voice was heard from Heaven.

Jesus' miracles primarily called attention to the Offering of the Kingdom. More and more people began to follow.

Jesus knew their thoughts, He forgave their sins and physically healed them. Jesus claimed clear, He does the work only God can do. Therefore, He is God.

Matthew was a tax-collector for Herod Antipas. He received the same invitation as Peter, Andrew, James, John and like the others, who followed Jesus immediately.

In the Psalm, the Psalmist found refuge in the Lord whom he trusted. God loves those who practice righteousness and who make right choices and display right attitudes in life.

Mark 1:2-3

\*As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, ‚ÄúSee, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.‚Äù\*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God had promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father so that the new Israel (Jesus) could lead them in their new exodus toward the promised land (Malachi 3:1).

\*‚ÄúPrepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.‚Äù\*

To prepare the way, for the Lord to enter their hearts, the people had to begin with repentance.

God had already prepared the way (a sinless womb) for the arrival of His Son into the world and Mary maintained the sanctity of her womb by ensuring that she always stayed out of sin so she received the Body of Christ into her body in a state of grace.

Like Mary, we too must do our best to remain out of sin at all times so that we can always receive the Body of Christ (Communion) into our bodies in a state of grace.

Mark 1:12‚Äì15
\*The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan;\*
God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

Mark 1:35
\*In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.\*

This was *God praying to God* in the early hours of the morning.

By waking up before dawn, going to an isolated place and spending time with God the Father, Jesus gave us a template for prayer. Jesus gave more importance to His time with God and adjusted His daily schedule in the rest of the time.

Inspite of His busy schedule Jesus always made it a point to spend time with God in solitude. He expects us to do the same. However busy we are with our earthly duties and commitments, we must spend sufficient time with God every day.

If Jesus humbled Himself to this level then we cannot make excuses to pray every morning. We must keep our mornings free for God and fit our daily schedule in the rest of the time. Our priority must be given to our time with God and not to our daily schedule.

Morning is the best time to pray so that we can start the day with the Lord, and Jesus is the best example (Psalm 90:14; 143:8-10). We can choose to be with the Lord in many ways like going to Church for the morning service or sitting alone in silence and speaking to the Lord, or getting together with family and praying, etc.

##### Jesus is Lord

[![Jesus is Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day155.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RLBBThbC7gw "Jesus is Lord")

##### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to the people in parables?‚Äù
Jesus‚Äô answer may shock you, let's read it.
‚ÄúTo you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‚Äòthey may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.‚Äô‚Äù
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah ‚Äì when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God‚Äôs forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
‚ÄúThen he said to them, ‚ÄúIs it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?‚Äù But they were silent.‚Äù He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It‚Äôs due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times ‚ÄúWhoever has ears, let them hear ‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It‚Äôs meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don‚Äôt really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as ‚Äì no good farmer will ever sow in these places ‚Äì this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God‚Äôs word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God‚Äôs words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let‚Äôs try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Mark 3:14
*And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles.*

When Jesus chose Judas to be one of His apostles, he was well aware that Judas was a thief. Inspite of this, Jesus kept Judas in charge of the money collection bag. Jesus gave Judas the opportunity to change himself and take care of the money bag honestly; but since Judas never had any intention to change himself, he chose to constantly steal money from the bag.

A man does not become a priest by his own wish but only when called by God (Hebrews 5:4). Therefore, Jesus chose Judas because it was God‚Äôs Will. So along with the good ones, God calls the ungodly ones also. God allows problems in the lives of the priests so that the good ones can go through spiritual healing and the holy ones can be glorified. In the meanwhile, the ungodly ones have a chance to mix with the good ones and transform themselves.

Satan used Judas to destroy God‚Äôs plan for redemption, but God transformed that evil into good by giving us redemption through the Blood of Christ, according to His plan, exactly as it was prophesied, and thus Jesus (the holy one) was glorified.

A smooth and comfortable life does not prove that a priest or his congregation are worthy to enter the gates of heaven. We must be tested for trust, obedience to God and righteousness, and God allows Satan to create obstacles in our path.

On the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front. Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers). Our duty as Christians is to handle the negative situation using God‚Äôs weapons (peace, unity, prayer, fasting, etc.).

Jesus showed us that even though all the Judases may betray Him by committing mortal sins, the Church (the mystical Body of Christ / the saints) will reach the promised land (Heaven), just as the physical Body of Christ did. We, the beloved disciples, are called to stand with the Church (the Body of Christ), through good times and bad times, to the end (John 19:26).

When we commit a mortal sin, we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified. Let us therefore ensure to keep our souls purified at all times.

The 12 Apostles didn't have much in common.
Matthew, the tax collector, was working for Rome, whereas Simon, the zealot, was bent on eliminating Rome. Judas was a thief, and some were fishermen. But surprisingly they were all united in Christ. Whatever their backgrounds they never fought with each other.

Mark 3:27
Jesus came to this area to bind the strong man (Satan) and take back what belonged to God (the man who was possessed by demons).

In the old Covenant, Jesus exorcized the demons from the people by His physical presence .
In the new Covenant, Jesus exorcizes the demons from our souls spiritually through the sacraments.

Mark 3:33-35
*But he said to them in reply, ‚ÄúWho are my mother and my brothers?‚Äù And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, ‚ÄúHere are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.‚Äù*

Jesus was upgrading all His disciples who believe in Him and obey the Will of God, of whom His Mother was the first and best example.
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to carry the promised Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Jesus asked the question and answered it Himself, thus making it known to all His disciples (present & future), that His mother perfectly fulfilled the role of being His Mother by her obedience and complete surrender to the Will of God. The Mother of Jesus is the first Christian who accepted Jesus even before He was born. By His question and answer, Jesus was also exalting His mother.

##### Jesus Casts Out Demons

[![Jesus Casts Out Demons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day156.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gWWwt7YOYOk "Jesus Casts Out Demons")

##### Day #156 "Prayer of faith brings healing" , ‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù

We read this moving story of Jairus and his daughter. The scene opens with a desperate father - Jairus who fell at Jesus' feet begging for the healing of his daughter. While Jesus was on the way to go heal the girl, there was a big crowd around Jesus ‚Äì many people were touching and pushing Jesus. However, one woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for many years and had spent all that she had but suffered at the hands of the physicians instead of getting healed. According to the customs, she should not touch anyone if not they would become unclean, however, her faith went beyond her reason and she reached out and touched Jesus‚Äô cloak, and immediately after she got healed of her hemorrhage. Jesus stopped and said ‚ÄúWho touched me?‚Äù for power went out of Him.
Even though there were many people who were pushing Jesus and touching Him, only the one who touched Him in faith received the healing. Even today when we pray, we sometimes do not have faith, we are just listing out our problems without believing that Jesus can heal us or provide for us -those prayers without faith are just like the crowd that was pushing Jesus, like the crowd that only followed Jesus because their belly was filled with the feeding of the multitude. We ought to make prayers of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù believing in our hearts that Jesus will answer them, these prayers of faith touch Jesus.
Never lose hope even if the situation gets worse like that of Jairus, whose daughter died while Jesus was on the way. Jesus encouraged Jairus and said, ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe‚Äù. Jesus entered the house, cleared the place of those mourning, and brought the girl back to life.
So be it with our life, even if it seems that God is not answering our prayers of faith do not give us. Jesus encourages us as he encouraged Jairus ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe‚Äù. Let us not be afraid of anything, even if it seems that all is lost, just trust in Him and have faith. Because Jesus is walking towards us, He is coming to take care of us. ‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù
Every time we are afraid just say these words Jesus taught Jairus.
‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Mark 5:4
\*For he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.\*

Inspite of being tied with shackles and chains the man was able to break himself free.

Sometimes we think we are smarter than the evil one and we can fool him easily but we have to remember that the evil one is the most intelligent creature of God‚Äôs creation. More often, than not, with his modern ideologies the evil one makes us walk on his path willingly, with no resistance from us at all. Without the presence of God in our lives we can be easily deceived into thinking that we are walking on the right path. Whatever we do to get rid of the devil, he will always find a new way to trick us. But God will be present in our lives only if we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, regularly, and keep our souls purified at all times.

Mark 5:18-20
\*As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. But Jesus refused, and said to him, ‚ÄúGo home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.‚Äù\*
\*And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.\*

The man wanted to be a disciple of Jesus but Jesus made him a missionary. After the demons were cast out of the man, and without any experience, he did such a great job of making Jesus known to the people that when Jesus came to that same place the second time there was a huge crowd of gentiles waiting to hear Him preach.

If we keep ourselves purified at all times the Lord will bless us and help us to be little missionaries like that man. We don't need to be scholars or experienced people to do God's work.

Mark 5:21-43
Jairus‚Äôs daughter was twelve years old, while the woman had been suffering from haemorrhage for the same length of time (12 years).

At the same moment when Jesus said to the woman, ‚ÄúDaughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace‚Äù Jairus got news from his home that his daughter had died. When one daughter was healed, the other one died.

Jairus may have been a synagogue official in that same area where the woman lived.
This is the one and only time Jesus addresses a woman as ‚Äúdaughter.‚Äù

Why here? And why now?

Probably, in order to call Jairus‚Äôs attention to the fact that he was not the only person there who had a daughter in need of healing.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

If this was indeed the case, we can wonder whether Jairus ever thought about this woman, whether he noticed that she was missing or remembered that she was excluded from God‚Äôs house. Perhaps he did not even give her a second thought all these years. But now, at the moment when his daughter lay desperately ill, when time was of the essence to heal her, this same woman delayed Jesus from coming to Jairus's home.
And it is certain that Jairus noticed her when he was with Jesus.

What could have been going on in Jairus‚Äôs heart at that moment?
Was he angry at her for delaying Jesus?
Did he want her to just go away?

All those thoughts would have come crashing down in the moment when he heard Jesus call her his ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù, and then in the next moment to hear his servant say: ‚ÄúDo not trouble the master: your daughter is dead.‚Äù

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God‚Äôs daughter for 12 years.

If we are God‚Äôs children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members (Christians) during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during Mass.

Mark 6:31
\*People were coming and going in great numbers, so that Jesus and His Apostles had no opportunity even to eat. So Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúCome away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.‚Äù\*

Jesus wanted the disciples to rest physically so that they could reflect spiritually on their mission. He wanted them to guard themselves against burnout.
God wants us to work for six days and rest on the seventh day because the seventh day must be dedicated to spending time with God, and Satan uses fatigue to separate us from God and our families. Fatigue causes irritation which leads to anger and thus disturbs the peace and happiness around us.

When the devil can‚Äôt make us bad, he makes us busy, because God does not speak to us when our bodies and minds are busy. God speaks to us (through our thoughts) only when our bodies are relaxed, our minds are at peace and there‚Äôs silence around.

##### DAY 156: By Sheila

In today's Study, Jesus reached out to the Gentiles even in seemingly hopeless situations. Healing demon possessed cases of powerful evil forces, apparently of fallen angels who are part of Satan's rebellious ones. They work in the arena of the mind, causing people to believe lies and embrace worldly wisdom.

Jesus always commanded them to depart. The void left in the person's life was to be filled by New Life, the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to walk in the Holy Spirit fullness.

The bleeding unclean woman, when she touched Jesus, He made her clean. All who came to Him had seen the miracles and heard life-changing teachings.

Many heard the circumstances surrounding His Birth and rejected Him, His hometown as well. Jesus equipped those who believed Him and sent them to do the work of the Kingdom.

John the Baptist refused to cover the adultery of Herod Antipas and Herodias. John was finally beheaded and put to death. The family was ruthless. He even stole his brother Philip's wife.

The feeding of 5,000 that Jesus performed was to verify that the Kingdom was being offered, provision for feasts, A training for His Disciples, A mission to feed the hungry with the little they had.

JESUS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD would supply all needs.

The Psalm is a thanksgiving for God's Blessings. The God who has brought Victories to His People ALWAYS, in the past, could be trusted to grant our future victories too.

##### Day #157 Jesus is the Good Shepherd described in Psalm 23

As we read Psalm 23 through the lens of the New Testament. We see Jesus as the fulfillment of the promise of the Good Shepherd. There is an explicit comparison in John 10 where Jesus is proclaimed the ‚ÄúGood Shepherd‚Äù. Let us go through this beautiful psalm 23 verse by verse.
‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures;‚Äù
We see that Jesus meets our biggest need, our need for redemption. We needed forgiveness of sins and needed a savior. That is when Jesus the good shepherd laid down his life to save us. We now can lie down in the green pastures of heaven, there are no tears or pain or suffering in heaven ‚Äì we will be full with the presence of the Lord.
Jesus will supply all our needs on earth as well ‚Äì whenever Jesus encountered anyone during His earthly life ‚Äì they never went back empty-handed ‚Äì they received healing, teaching, deliverance, and physical food as well. Jesus supplied all their needs and will supply all our needs as well. We shall not be in want.
‚Äúhe leads me beside still waters;‚Äù
We read in the Gospels that Jesus was able to still the raging storms and even walk on water and encourages Peter to walk on the water. Jesus knows that our lives are filled with worries and burdens, hence he invites us ‚ÄúCome to me and I will give you rest‚Äù ‚Äì He will lead us through still waters and give us rest.
‚Äúhe restores my soul.‚Äù
Jesus came to restore the relationship of man with God. He restores our souls to the father. Whenever Jesus healed anyone ‚Äì he also made them whole, forgave them their sins, and said do it no more. He is restoring everyone‚Äôs soul to the state of no sin.
‚ÄúHe leads me in right paths for his name‚Äôs sake.‚Äù
As a good shepherd he calls us by name, His own hear his voice and follow Him. We are his sheep and He is our good shepherd. He not only leads us on the right path but is the right path. ‚ÄúHe is the gate and the way‚Äù.
‚ÄúEven though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me;‚Äù
Even if we lose our way, Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes looking for the 1 lost sheep. Once found He binds our wounds and restores us back to the flock. We need not fear for Jesus promised us that He is with us till the end of ages. Even if we go through tough times we should not fear ‚ÄúFear Not, only believe‚Äù
your rod and your staff‚Äî they comfort me.
Jesus comforts us from the Cross, He pleads for us and asks the Father to forgive us our sins. Jesus suffers for us on the Cross and gives us the courage and suffers with us when we go through tough times on earth. The wooden staff can be compared to the cross and the rod can be compared to the sphere that pierced his side, blood and water poured out to the whole world, forgiving us.
‚ÄúYou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;‚Äù
This good shepherd at the last supper instituted the Eucharist. He asks us to remember him at the table of the altar. He said ‚Äì ‚Äúdo this in memory of me.‚Äù
you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Our cup will never run dry as Jesus does not give us earthy water but the living water, the Holy Spirit that whelms up within our hearts. We are anointed by the Holy Spirit with a font that is ever-flowing, never-ending.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
Jesus‚Äôs Mercy and goodness are ever-present to us. He never rejects us no matter how bad our sin is, we are always welcome to approach the Mercy seat of Jesus, for he knows our weakness and is able to sympathize with us.
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.
One thing that we can be sure of is Jesus‚Äô presence in our lives. He is Emmanuel ‚Äì God with us. Rather than us going up to the temple in Jerusalem, Jesus comes to us at every Church in the form of the Holy Eucharist. He is always present to us, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts. If anyone lets me in, I will come in and dine with them.
May we love Jesus our Good shepherd and welcome Him into every part of our lives.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Mark 7:1‚Äì13
*And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?‚Äù*

Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous human traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined God‚Äôs truths. He instructed his followers to abide by the traditions that are not contrary to God‚Äôs commandments. And, as the Apostles taught (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15), the rest are to be obeyed.

Mark 7:24-30
\*She came and bowed down at his feet.\*

By bowing down at His feet / kneeling before Him, the gentile woman was acknowledging the divinity of Jesus.
Jesus first ignored the lady but she persisted in her request. Inspite of being a Canaanite she worshipped him by calling him ‚ÄúLord.‚Äù

She humbled herself in front of a Jew. She was desperate because her child was being tormented by a demon and she knew the situation was out of her control.

When our children go far away from God it is best to place our children in God's hands because we cannot fight demons, only God can. Meanwhile, we must continue making efforts to improve our own spiritual life while we also pray for our children. If we use our human efforts to solve the problem it can turn into a disaster.

\*Jesus said to her, ‚ÄúLet the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children‚Äôs food and throw it to the dogs.‚Äù\*

The Israelites are the children of God (Exodus 4:22-23; Deut. 14:1; Isaiah 1:2).
Jesus compared the woman to a dog because He wanted to bring out her faith.
It may sound like Jesus was being rude to the woman, but that is exactly how it feels when our faith is being tested.

When Jesus compared the woman to a dog, she had two options :

1. she could allow her pride to control her, take the response of Jesus as an insult and leave Jesus, OR,

2. she could humble herself and accept that she was not the greatest.

If she chose Option 1, then, because of her pride, her daughter would have to live with the demon all her life.
But the Cannanite woman made a wise choice. She chose Option 2, and Jesus healed the child because of the faith, humility and persistent prayer of the mother.

The tests, for our faith in Christ, don‚Äôt come on a bed of roses. They are usually rocks and thorns which come in the form of rejections, insults, criticisms, humiliation, false accusations, etc.
If we look at them positively then our humility will help us to see God working through them to heal us spiritually. But if we look at them negatively then our pride will only show us how we have been demoralized, disrespected, hurt, etc. In other words, our pride will show us that we are the god who was not given importance.

The Canaanite woman, however, did not look at the response of Jesus as negative or rude. In her humility she accepted her comparison to a dog and replied appropriately.

Let us learn from the Cannanite woman to humble ourselves and choose our words wisely when we communicate with others.

\*But she answered him, ‚ÄúSir, even the dogs under the table eat the children‚Äôs crumbs.‚Äù\*

It is, and always has been, an insult for anyone to be compared to a dog (Philippians 3:2; Revelation 22:15).
These words of the gentile woman being accepted by Jesus was an assurance for the first century gentiles that the Bread of salvation was available, not only for the Jews, but, also for the gentiles.

Crumbs are left-overs.
The children are the people of God whom Jesus came to feed with the heavenly bread, but if the Jews don't want the Bread of Life then the gentiles will starve because there won‚Äôt be any crumbs.

Similarly, if Christians don‚Äôt live in a state of grace then the Bread of Life which they eat is no good (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) therefore the non-Christians will suffer because Jesus will not save the world through Christians whose light does not shine.

\*Then he said to her, ‚ÄúFor saying this, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.‚Äù\*

Sometimes when we feel that our children have spiritually declined or gone far away from God, let us remember that the Cannanite woman‚Äôs daughter was freed from the demon because of her mother‚Äôs faith, humility and persistent prayer, and, like the Cannanite woman, let us pray persistently for our fallen away children.
Like the despised Cannanite woman, however sinful we parents may be, God will surely answer our prayers and spiritually heal the souls of our fallen away children, if we make an attempt to increase our own faith in God and be humble always.

Mark 7:33
\*He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.\*

Jesus could have just said the word and the man would have been healed, but He chose to use a sacramental procedure to perform this miracle.

A sacrament is an outward sign of an inward grace.
Jesus used His saliva and fingers for grace to flow into the man. The man could have felt disgusted and backed away but it was his humility that made him accept the method which Jesus was using.

By performing this miracle sacramentally, Jesus was also preparing His Apostles for the Last Supper where He was going to offer His Sacramental Body and Blood in atonement for our sins, so that they would understand how God's grace flows into humans through materials when they would do the same after Pentecost Sunday.

##### The Reality of Sin

[![The Reality of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day158.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SMPDppmKYVY "The Reality of Sin")

##### Day #158 The Transfiguration - a Theophany

The Transfiguration is one of those events in Jesus‚Äô life that we are very familiar with. Sometimes being too familiar causes us to overlook certain things. The purpose of the Transfiguration as most of us know is to reveal Jesus‚Äôs divinity. We know Jesus is divine and we read everything else based on this knowledge.
But for the apostles and first-century Jewish and pagan people, they are discovering the fact that Jesus is actually divine.
Mountain:
The first item to analyze is the ‚ÄúMountain‚Äù Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain. As we have been studying the OT we know that the Mountains are symbolic for God experiences ‚Äì Moses goes up the mountain to encounter the Lord face to face (although he does not see God face to face, but was able to see the glory of God as God passed by) Also Mount Zion is the place where they went up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple built by King Solomon.
When Jesus took them up the Mountain, they would have known that there is going to be a God experience ‚Äì a ‚ÄúTheophany‚Äù.
Moses & Elijah:
Now, wait a minute what are they doing here in the NT. We know that Moses is dead and Elijah was taken up into heaven. The thing that is common between the two is they both went up a mountain to meet God, they had a Theophany. Moses represents the Law and Elijah represents the Prophets. We know that both Moses and Elijah had to hide their face in the OT ‚Äì Moses saw the back for God and Elijah hide his face when he recognized God in the wind, but now we see them ‚Äútalking‚Äù to Jesus. They were unable to see the glory of God, but now Jesus bridges the gap and we human beings can speak to God.
Bright Clothing, Voice, and Cloud:
Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúgarments‚Äù became ‚Äúglistening‚Äù or intensely white. This is symbolic that He is divine, this was the way heavenly creatures were represented. Jesus gives the apostle a glimpse of the hidden glory hidden under his human flesh. We also hear the voice of God ‚Äì affirming that Jesus is God.
‚ÄúThis is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!‚Äù. The cloud mentioned here represents the presence of God, just as it used to come down in the temple/tabernacle/ holy of holies ‚Äì and everyone was in awe and could not even enter the temple. Similar to the experience that Mary had when the Holy Spirit overshadowed her at the annunciation. Looks like Peter James and John experienced this Theophany - an encounter with God, where Jesus is revealed to them as God, a God that we can talk to.
Booths
Peter made an interesting recommendation to build 3 booths. What he seems to be referring to here is the feast of the booths. We have read about it in Exodus where they would make tents/booths/tabernacles and stay in them, feasting on the fruit of the harvest ‚Äì as an icon of the resurrection. Peter is carried away and thinks it's already Resurrection.
Hope this helps us enrich our experience of the Transfiguration. May we have a Theophany experience the next time we go to adoration.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us üôè

Mark 9:5 & 9
Peter was ecstatic for a short while, when he saw the glorious heavenly scene, but eventually he had to leave the place and go down the mountain.

Sometimes when we experience small miracles in our lives or when we are engaged in prayer and meditation with the Lord in solitude and silence, we may feel so ecstatic that we don't want that moment to end but the reality is that we are still in this world and we will have to face challenges often.

Mark 9:28-29
\*When he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, ‚ÄúWhy could we not cast it out?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúThis kind can come out only through prayer and fasting.‚Äù\*

Prayer is a radical acceptance of our dependence on God.
Fasting is not observed to experience hunger or to punish ourselves by starving our bodies.
Fasting is observed to remind us that our existence and sustenance is dependent on God, and not on the material food which we eat (Deut. 8:3).

An exorcist priest must be in a state of grace, with prayer and fasting included, before performing an exorcism because the devil knows exactly who is in a Covenant with God and who is not, otherwise it can be very dangerous for the priest while performing the exorcism (Acts 19:13-16).

Mark 9:37
\*Whoever receives one child like this in my name, receives me.\*
When Christians bring forth children as a gift from God, they receive Jesus into their Christian homes. When they refuse to bring forth children they are refusing Jesus.

Mark 9:38-39
\*John said to him, ‚ÄúTeacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.‚Äù\*

The seventy elders who received God‚Äôs Spirit through Moses were a shadow of the ministry of the Apostles (Numbers 11:16-17).
Like Joshua (Numbers 11:25‚Äì29), John too made the mistake of presuming that only a select few are inspired and entrusted to carry out God‚Äôs plans.
The disciples exhibited a worldly sense of competition regarding the spiritual ministry of exorcism.
They wanted their power to be exclusively for themselves and they wanted to be the exclusive channel of God‚Äôs grace.

The Spirit blows where it wills (John 3:8), and God desires to bestow His Spirit on all His people in every nation under Heaven (Acts 2:5, 38).
God can, and will, work mighty deeds through the most unexpected and unlikely people. All of us are called to perform even our most humble tasks, such as giving a cup of water, for the sake of the Lord‚Äôs name and the cause of His kingdom.

Often, like Joshua and John, perhaps without noticing it, we cloak our failings and fears under the guise of our desire to defend Christ or the Church.
But as Jesus says, instead of worrying about who is a real Christian and who is not, we should make sure that we ourselves are leading lives worthy of our calling as disciples (Ephesians 1:4).
We need to keep meditating on God‚Äôs Law. We need to pray for the grace to detect our failings and to overcome them.

Mark 10:2-12
Why did Jesus forbid divorce and re-marriage?
A Christian marriage is a sacrament because it is a union between two baptized persons. Marriage is a Covenant relation, and Covenants are lifetime spiritual bonds.

In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church (Ephesians 5:23-24).
The Church is the bride of Christ and was created to be with Jesus forever just as woman was created to be with her spouse for lifetime. Therefore, God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16).

In the old Covenant, divorce and remarriage (Deut. 24:1-3 or 4) were permissible because the old Covenant Temple was only a temporary symbol of the Body of Christ. The new Covenant Church (the Christians) is the true bride of Christ and just as Jesus and His bride (the Church) are inseparable, so also man and wife must never divorce. When a Christian couple divorce they break the sacred bond.

What God has put together, no one can separate (Mark 10:9), therefore divorce does not erase the lifetime marriage Covenant vows. Thus, divorcing our spouse and marrying another is considered as adultery because, by the marriage Covenant vows, we are joined to our first spouse until death separates us.

Jesus reminded the people that divorce was never in God's plan for humanity from the beginning. Jesus therefore forbade divorce (Mark 10:9), and if a couple must separate due to unavoidable circumstances, it is NOT a permission for them to re-marry (Mark 10:11-12; 1 Corinthians 7:10-11).

Jesus revealed that marriage is a divine, life-giving sign. Through the union of man and wife, God intended to bestow His blessings on the human family, making it fruitful, multiplying it until it filled the earth (Genesis 1:28).

##### Bearing Fruit

[![Bearing Fruit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day159.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CCyJ2WtJ2Gk "Bearing Fruit")

##### Day 159 The Fig tree from Genesis.

The day after Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, we see Jesus cursing the fig tree. It seems kind of odd, as though Jesus is having a bad Monday. The Gospel says ‚Äòfor it was not the season for figs‚Äô Mark 11:13 ‚Äì why would Jesus expect figs when it‚Äôs not fig season.
Before the deeper analysis, we should ask ourselves the obvious. Why would Jesus curse a tree that had no fruit? One obvious reason would be the lack of fruit.
We are called to bear fruit and be fruitful. Jesus did use the example of tree and fruits a few times ‚Äì like the one where the good tree bears good fruits, and the even tree bears evil fruits. Also about the vine and the branches, the branches that do not bear fruit will be removed and the branches that bear fruit will be pruned to bear more fruit. Another one was the parable of the barren tree where the gardener pleads for one more year. The idea of a tree and its fruit is not new to the Jews, prophet Isaiah had warned them about the Vineyard that yielded wild grapes instead of good ones. So whenever Jesus used these parables they would have almost immediately latched on to the idea.
Let‚Äôs take a different look at the cursing of the fig tree today, Jesus curses a fig tree why only a fig tree and not a palm tree or olive tree. One connection that we can make is the fig tree from Genesis. Although no fig tree is mentioned, we have a mention of the fig leaves.
Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7
Most paintings of the original sin have the apple as the fruit that was eaten by Eve and then Adam. However, this may be a painter‚Äôs imagination as there is no mention of an apple tree in Genesis. The only description of a fruit tree can be taken from the fig leaves. If the tree that our first parents ate from is a fig tree, it kind of makes some sense that the new Adam Jesus ‚Äì did not eat the fruit, instead, he cursed the tree and said to it
‚ÄúHe said to it, ‚ÄòMay no one ever eat fruit from you again.‚Äô And his disciples heard it.‚Äù Mark 11:14
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
Jesus came to destroy sin and set us free from sin. That is why he said may no one ever eat the fruit of the tree of sin. He came to liberate us, to give us forgiveness and the power to avoid sin. We are called to bear fruit of holiness and fruit of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control(Gal 5:22)
Soon after the fig tree cursing Jesus entered the temple and cleansed it, Jesus is most certainly targeting sin, the original sin of disobedience. We have not only eaten the forbidden fruit but made God‚Äôs temple a trading place. Like the temple authorities, we tend to shift the focus from the worship of God to earthly things.
Finally, we see Jesus telling the parable of the wicked tenants where a man planted a vineyard and leased it out to tenants who seized and killed many of the owners‚Äô servants. The twist in the parable comes when the owner sends his only son, instead of an army. Jesus is describing his own life death and resurrection ‚Äì one hint would be that in the parable the son was cast out of the vineyard and killed referring to Jesus' crucifixion outside the city of Jerusalem.
Let us be encouraged by what Jesus did for us, He come to this world and cursed sin, then sacrificed his own life for us and we now have a new tree of life, the cross.
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Mark 11:2
*You will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden.*

Why bring a colt that has never been ridden?
Because it was in line with God's command to Moses:
An animal meant for sacred purpose was not to be put to any profane use (Numbers 19:2). But that was only a shadow of the reality.

The womb that bore Jesus was meant to be exclusively for Him.
The tomb where He was buried was meant to be exclusively for Him.
Similarly, He would ride a colt that was meant to be exclusively for Him, while on His way to Jerusalem to be received by His people as their King.
This was God‚Äôs Will to emphasize the divinity of His Son.

Mark 11:11
*Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple area.*

A victorious earthly king of an earthly kingdom would normally enter his palace and sit on the throne after his people welcomed him with joy, but Jesus was the heavenly King of a holy Kingdom and therefore He entered the Temple after He was welcomed.

Mark 11:13-14
God‚Äôs people, who are spiritually fruitful, are like good figs and will be rewarded. Those who fail to be spiritually fruitful are like the bad figs and will be destroyed (Hosea 9:10; Jeremiah 24:8-10).

Mark 11:15-16
*Jesus made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ. Even if it was a shadow it was sacred because it was consecrated. Jesus noticed that the Sanhedrin had profaned the Temple by permitting the people to use it as a marketplace.
He therefore purged out what was wrong and then taught them to do what is right. He drove out those who profaned the Temple and showed displeasure at those who turned the place of worship into a place for worldly gain.

The Church building too is a sacred place because it is consecrated but the Church is the real Body of Christ. The Bishops and Pastors must take care to ensure that they do not permit the people to use the Church building for ungodly purposes or else they will be profaning it.

Our bodies are Temples of the Holy Spirit because we are consecrated (baptized). Therefore, we must ensure to detach ourselves from worldly things and purge out all our sins by receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that we can be in a state of grace before we receive the Body of Christ (Communion) (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Mark 12:41-44
The poor widow possessed only two coins and had nothing else to live on. Yet, without any hesitation she gave all that she had, to support God‚Äôs priests in the Temple.
This may have reminded Jesus of His own widowed mother, whose only support for her livelihood was her one son. Nevertheless, she too willingly offered Him completely to serve God, without asking for any benefits for herself and without thinking of herself and her future.
In appreciating the widow with the two coins, Jesus deeply appreciated His own mother‚Äôs sacrifice.

Some centuries ago, the widow in Zarephath, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah and the promise of his Lord. Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family (1 Kings 17:10-16).

These poor widows were not successful in their material lives, yet they gave all that they had, unselfishly, even though they were left empty handed and not sure when their next meal was going to come. They willingly gave because they wanted to please God, not humans. They mirror the love of God the Father in giving His only Son, and Christ‚Äôs love in sacrificing Himself on the Cross.

God sees everything and He also sees what we offer. He is interested only in the quality of our offerings, not the quantity. God sees our heart when we offer.

A Church parish which is made up of selfish and comfortable Christians, cannot stand for long. The parish flourishes only when we Christians, who are cells in the Body of Christ, take care of the Priests and the less fortunate ones, which is one of the fundamental aspect of our Christian life. If we say we love God but our love for God does not convert into caring for others and generous giving to the Kingdom of God on earth, then our love for God is fake love.

Whatever we possess all belongs to God (Psalm 24:1) and we don‚Äôt take anything with us when we die (1 Timothy 6:7).
So let us not be selfish with our giving. Let us keep our eyes and ears open so that we can be aware if God is telling us or showing us who He wants us to help.

##### Day #160 Watch and pray

There is a great necessity to be watchful and to sustain in prayer. Jesus tells us the parable of the man who leaves home and puts his servants in charge. The servants should be doing their work as no one knows the hour when the owner will return, lest he finds them asleep when he returns. We have these words of Jesus that we should take seriously ‚ÄúTake heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time will come.‚Äù
Our frail human nature does not make it easy for us to follow this teaching, we are easily distracted and find it hard to stay focused on prayer. Like Peter, James, and John at Gethsemane, we keep dosing off. Jesus was sorrowful and struggling in prayer He said ‚ÄúMy soul is very sorrowful, even to death, remain here and watch‚Äù. In the Gospel of Luke, there is a mention that ‚ÄúThen His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground‚Äù. Even though Jesus is going through such suffering, the disciples find it hard to even pray for Him.
Jesus said ‚ÄúSimon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you do not fall into temptations; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak‚Äù
Jesus found them sleeping two more times, their eyes were very heavy and they could not pray. Jesus asked Simon to pray three times and we know that Simon fails to pray three times. Had he prayed those three times, he would have probably had the strength to overcome his fear and would not have denied Jesus three times.
Most of us are weak because we do not pray, Jesus has overcome the world and wants us to live a victorious life. However, we are unable to pray and hence unable to reject sin. We have no power in us because we have little or no prayer life. Let us make time for prayer, even if it means waking up an hour earlier than everyone else. Spending an hour in holy adoration or attending weekday Mass. Let us pray and be strong. Watch and pray so that we will be in the state of grace when Jesus comes or when we die and go up to meet Him as the just judge. ‚ÄúWatch and pray!!‚Äù let‚Äôs say it again ‚ÄúWatch and pray!!‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 160 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 13:1-26
This prophecy is associated with Zechariah 14:4 (the day of the Lord) which says that the Messiah would come when the end is near.
The purpose of this chapter is to prepare the Church for a period of distress, trials and persecutions before the second coming of Christ. The proper Christian attitude should be not to panic or to be alarmed, but to persevere in faith till the end.

Jesus was speaking of two destructions: the Temple and the city.

The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe. The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.
Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city. It was a Temple with a city around it, but it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).

Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city. It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it. The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally.

Mark 13:33
*Jesus said, "stay awake, be alert and pray for you know not when the time will come."*

Let us make sure to remain in a state of grace at all times by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation and Communion regularly, so that we will always be prepared to go with the Lord whenever He comes to take us.
Let us always be alert to sins of all kind so that we can avoid committing them.

Mark 14:1-2
*It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.*
God had given these two festivals to the Israelites as two separate feasts but during the time of Jesus they were both being celebrated together as desired by God.

Both feasts of the old Covenant were shadows of the Unleavened Bread (Communion) and Passover (Mass) of the new Covenant which Jesus inaugurated in the Upper Room and finished on Calvary and thereafter gave them to the Church to be celebrated until the end of time.

*The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, ‚ÄúNot during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.‚Äù*
Everything was going according to God's divine plan and God allowed the evil ones to go ahead with their plan so that God‚Äôs plan would be fulfilled.
On the day and hour when the earthly lambs would be slaughtered for the old Passover to commemorate the physical liberation of the people of the old Israel from the evil Pharaoh, on the same day and hour the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) would be killed for the new Passover to spiritually liberate the baptized people of the new Israel (the Church) from Satan.

Mark 14:7
*For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.*
Jesus was not confirming that poverty will flourish.
Jesus was reminding us of the words of Moses (Deut. 15:11).
By serving the poor we serve God.

Mark 14:22-24
*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

The priest consumes the bread and wine separately because that is how Jesus gave it to them in the Upper Room. The sacrifice is complete only when the priest consumes both.

*This is my body ...........; This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

When God speaks, His Word does not return empty. His words accomplish what is spoken (Isaiah 55:11; Genesis 1:3).

Therefore, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" the bread and wine became His mystical Body and Blood.
In the old Covenant, the earthly lamb was a symbol and it died after it was slaughtered, therefore it did not have the power to give the people eternal life when they received it.
In the new Covenant, by His life, death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus put the power of the Holy Spirit in the heavenly Lamb (of God) therefore this Lamb can give us eternal life when we receive it in a state of grace because this Lamb is still living even though He died after He was slaughtered.

The words of consecration can be repeated by anyone, but the transubstantiation takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit only when an apostolic priest says the exact words in obedience to the command of Jesus because the authority was given only to the ordained apostles, who in turn must give that same authority to their apostolic successors. Therefore, if any other person repeats the words of consecration the bread and wine will still remain bread and wine; they will not be transformed.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice. Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real. Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired. By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

Mark 14:44-46, 50, 66-71.
*All 12 apostles received their priestly ordination (Holy Orders) in the Upper Room and all 12 of them had the Eucharist (Communion) but shortly after that Judas betrayed Jesus, Peter denied Jesus and the remaining 10 abandoned Jesus.*
Receiving Communion or any other sacraments is not a guarantee that the devil will stop tempting us to follow him. One mortal sin is enough for the devil to start controlling our thoughts, words and deeds, and make us use our bodies (eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc.) for sinful purposes. He has a million ways to fool us into committing sins. We must, therefore, remain alert to sin until the last day of our lives and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation whenever we fail.

*Jesus was taken away from the Apostles after Judas betrayed Him. Thereafter the apostles were scattered by Satan.*
When we betray Jesus with our sins, God leaves us. This automatically puts us in the hands of Satan whose aim is to destroy families and communities and eventually the Church, by causing division between the members and scattering them.
Let us make sure to resolve our problems peacefully and stay united with our family members as well as with our Christian community, irrespective of our differences.

##### The Crucifixion of Christ

[![The Crucifixion of Christ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day161.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Inche74z-L8 "The Crucifixion of Christ")

##### Day #161 My God my God why have you forsaken me

The most difficult part of Jesus‚Äô suffering would have been the separation from the Father and the Spirit. When Jesus took our sin upon Himself, he would have felt all the guilt that every human has ever felt. When we sin, we feel separated from God as though God is far away or angry with us. When Jesus took on the cup of suffering our sin, He suffered and died for us. Sin cost the very life of God. The Holy Trinity is so united in love that the pain caused to the Father and the Spirit to see the Son suffer is unthinkable. Although Jesus wasn‚Äôt abandoned by God, He probably felt what we human beings feel when we commit sin. The effects of sin are terrible, and we can see it manifest in the cross, where the purest one suffered for us all.
The other reason Mark used this verse was the point to Psalm 22 where we see the suffering of David(or any human being for that matter). Also, the Psalm is fulfilled in Jesus' passion ‚ÄúI am a worm and no man scorned by men and despised by the people‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am poured out like water‚Äù ‚Äúmy heart is like wax‚Äù and ‚Äúthey pierced my hands and my feet‚Äù.
Suffering is part of life, and no one can avoid it. Suffering is in fact the way to the cross, to salvation. We are called to embrace suffering and not flee from it, pick up our cross and follow Him daily. We may feel abandoned or feel that God is not answering our prayers. However remember as Jesus rose from the dead, we will also rise above our suffering if we accept it. We may feel like running away from our sufferings and even pray like Jesus ‚ÄúMay this cup pass from me‚Äù, but the only way forward is to accept our crosses. He will not let us be tested beyond our capacity, remember that Jesus is with us even though we may feel that we have been abandoned.
‚Äú And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.‚Äù Mat 28:20
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel

[![Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day162.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PnluN3nNDUc "Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel")

##### Day #162 Kings/Politicians use their power to lead people away from God.

We should always remember that Israelites were the ones who wanted a King. Earlier God was their King, leading them with fire and smoke and speaking to them through their leaders Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and Jacob. Even though God knew the Kings would eventually dominate the Israelites and misuse their power, He gave them what they asked for. We learned about King David, the high points and low points in his life. King Solomon the builder who built the beautiful temple, the wise man who stored up a lot of wealth. He misused his wisdom to impose high taxes on the people and made them work really hard as he used that money to build temples for his pagan wives' gods.
One would think that his son would be more sensitive to the people but turns out that Rehoboam did not take the counsel of the older/wiser men. Rehoboam listed to his friends ‚Äì or rather the ones who listen to him.
‚ÄúMy father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions‚Äù
Rehoboam is God‚Äôs anointed king yet so corrupt and evil, that the people literally drive him out of Israel(Northern) and he goes to the smaller part of Israel(Judah).
Now, remember every Jew had to go to the temple in Jerusalem to worship. Jeroboam(Solomon‚Äôs other son who came back from exile after his death) the king of the North did not want people going to the south to worship lest their hearts turn to God and they decide to follow the anointed king Rehoboam. So Jeroboam does the unthinkable ‚Äì he establishes his own religion ‚Äì he builds Golden calves for people to worship in the North. We can see how power has caused these Kings to reject God and his goodness.
In our more modern history, we have seen Kings going against the true church. King Henry VIII started the process of creating the Church of England after his split with the Pope in the 1530s. Henry was anxious to ensure a male heir after his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had borne him only a daughter. He wanted his marriage annulled in order to remarry. This boosted Protestantism and many wealthy people left the catholic church because they did not want to displease the king, the poor people were afraid of the fines put on them.
There are numerous examples in our history and present-day Politicians where God is rejected just so that those in power can get what they want. May we not be afraid but follow our conscious and do what is right in the sight of God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 162 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 12:12-17
The Davidic kings were shadows of the royal nature of Jesus and therefore they were supposed to be the loving bridegrooms of Israel (2 Samuel 5:1). But, like an abusive bridegroom, Rehoboam refused to listen to the people's pains and oppressed his bride (Israel) more than before, and thus forced the 10 tribes of Israel to divorce him (separate themselves from him).

1 Kings 12:26-33
After the death of King Solomon, God left His people and thereafter the kingdom of Israel was split into two. King Jeroboam ruled the northern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 10 tribes, whereas Solomon‚Äôs son King Rehoboam ruled the southern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 2 tribes.

Jeroboam was worried that if the people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple, as desired by God, then they may once again turn towards Rehoboam. He was also afraid that the people may kill him to return to Rehoboam. So he made two golden calves and he asked the people to worship the golden calves. He built shrines in the northern kingdom as a cultic move against the Jerusalem Temple. It was done to increase the economic structure of the northern kingdom by stopping the people from going to Jerusalem for the annual festivals (Passover, etc.). Jeroboam also ordained non-Levitcal men as priests, which was not acceptable to God (1 Kings 13:33-34) because it was not the Mosaic ordination.

Jeroboam was earlier working under Solomon as the manager of forced labor. God elevated Jeroboam from a king‚Äôs servant to be a king himself (1 Kings 11:26-39) and gave him a chance to lead the people and bring them closer to God, but Jeroboam, in his greed, took the people away from God.
Thus Jeroboam displeased the Lord.

If God has blessed us with a supervisory or leadership role, let us ensure that we please God in everything we say and do. Let us also ensure that we guide our subordinates to do the same, whether we are parents, teachers, ministers, pastors, managers, directors, etc.

##### Day #163 In love with God

Many people complain that religion is boring, and praying is more like a chore. This is a genuine experience for those who are not experiencing a love relationship with the Lord. Our God is not a distant God who gave us the 10 commandments and said ‚Äì ‚ÄúOk now follow them or else you‚Äôre going to hell‚Äù.
The Song of Solomon/Songs gives us a poetic picture of how God loves us and pursues us. He is like a lover seeking out his love and calling her and seeking after her. It‚Äôs compared to nature in springtime, how the dove seeks out its mate. The male birds are more beautiful than the female and they sport colorful feathers, dance, and make sounds to impress the females. The dove finds a mate and becomes a bonded pair ‚Äì raising chicks and only focused on their lives. In the same way, our lover Jesus goes after the lost sheep and seeks it out, once He finds it will dust off the dirt and carry it back on his shoulders.
Our God is not distant but is always with us, even until the end of the age. He knows everything about us when we sit down when we rise up when we come and go out.
Even before a word is on our lips, he already knows it. He cares for us and comforts us when we are in distress.
We are called to love him back and seek after Him with all our heart, mind, and soul. Our prayers and practices should be works of passion and with great love for the Lord.
‚Äúlet me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.‚Äù SOS 2:14
We need to seek Jesus' face, more than his hands. We need to bring prayers of praise and worship before we pray prayers of petition. Let us seek Jesus' beautiful face in the Eucharist as we receive it and fall deeply in love with him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 163: By Sheila

In the Book of Kings, the Prophet who spoke to Kings, went to the pagan altar where King Jeroboam led in worship of false gods. He prophesied that a King from the lineage of David would come to cleanse the altar of its pagan sacrifices. This prophecy was fulfilled by King Josiah nearly three Centuries later.
In Chronicles, Rehoboam forsook the Law of the Lord and suffered defeat and lost the cities he had built. It was the end of Rehoboam's Reign.
Abijah became King, he cried out to the Lord. His faithfulness to the Lord, got him victory. The Mother of Abijah was the beloved wife if King Rehoboam. She was the daughter of Tamar, grand-daughter of Absalom and she worshipped idols.
The Covenant of Salt describes the effective and permanent Character of God's Covenant with David because salt is used as a preservative and enhance flavor.
In the Song if Songs, God's love is manifested. He is calling, pursuers us, cares and comforts all.
Nothing can seperate us from God's Love. Foxes that spoil the vines is a reference found in any intimate relationship. A marriage is a commitment to work through such difficulties and protect relationship.

##### Day #164 People turn to God when everything else fails.

At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, and Jeroboam said to his wife, ‚ÄúGo, disguise yourself, so you won‚Äôt be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there‚Äîthe one who told me I would be king over this people.
Why would he ask his wife to disguise herself, one reason would be because King Jeroboam was not in good standing with the prophets or God. He is the King in the North that built idols and ordained fake priests just so that people would not go to the south to worship in Jerusalem.
But when it came to his own son Abijah he wanted to somehow have the Lord heal him. He tried a crooked way to get God‚Äôs blessing, it didn‚Äôt work. Remember last time the prophet was torn apart by the Lion because he ate with this King.
One cannot dodge God, God is all-knowing.
This is the case with many of the people in the world today. They want to live as they want and indulge in worldly pleasure and comforts. When they get sick or have problems, they turn to medicine, counseling, meditation, and therapy(not that any of those are wrong - they should be treated as instruments the Lord uses to heal us - these become a problem when they become an end in its own).
When everything else fails they want the Lord to heal them, they would come in disguise only with the intention to be healed, visit every prayer center, and holy place, ask everyone to pray and once they receive the healing they are back in the world. We see the bad fate of Jeroboam, his wife, and the sick son even dies.
Let us not be like Jeroboam, but seek the Lord earnestly with all our hearts, minds, and body. We should always pray and have a relationship with God, in good and bad times. We should not be part-time servers, but lifelong disciples of the Lord, who follow Him as he leads us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #165 ‚ÄúMy sister, my bride‚Äù

These words from the book of Song of Solomon may seem odd
A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed. SOS 4:12
The Bridegroom is referring to the bride as my sister, my bride which can be seen as weird. However, the deeper meaning can be understood by the Greek definition of the word love. Greek words for love are Agape, Eros, Philia, and Storge.
Agape is the unconditional love of God for His children.
Eros means romantic or intimate love.
Philia is affectionate friendship
Storge is affectionate love for children or parents.
In a good marriage, it is important to have Philia love as Eros will not last a lifetime. A couple should have an affectionate friendship(Philia) so they can spend a good life together. The phrase ‚ÄúI married my best friend‚Äù is well-fitting in this context. If there is a lack of friendship between a husband and wife, married life becomes a drag. Philia love lasts a lifetime and grows as the years go by. However Eros love on its own can seem to diminish over the years, but if the Philla love is kept active, Eros love grows as well.
Eros love separated from Philla can becomes selfish and affect the marriage in a negative way. The Bridegroom is not supposed to take his wife for granted, as described in SOS -she is a "locked garden". One should approach Eros love as a request and in openness, seeking and not demanding. Just like in the next chapter we read ‚ÄúMy beloved is knocking‚Äù ‚Äì one is called to be a gentleman/woman ‚Äì approach Eros love as though it‚Äôs a gift.
Jesus our bridegroom ‚Äì approaches us with the same gentleness. Jesus does not push and force His way into our lives. In the Book of Revelation, we read about Him knocking at the door of our hearts.
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. Rev 3:20
Jesus could have easily said ‚Äì ‚ÄúI am your creator, better listen to me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI died for you, stop sinning and let me eat dinner‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere is the fruit? May this tree be destroyed‚Äù But he didn't.
Jesus approaches us with gentleness, ‚ÄúHere I am‚Äù ‚ÄúI stand‚Äù ‚ÄúI knock‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúif anyone hears my voice‚Äù ‚Äúif you open the door‚Äù ‚Äì just picture this the savior of the world, standing and knocking ‚Äì waiting for our response. Let us not delay in opening our hearts, to welcome the Love of lives Jesus into every aspect of our lives into the Philla and Eros of our marriages. It takes 3 to get married ‚Äì husband, wife, and God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

#### Day #166 Was prophet Elijah mean to the Widow

We read the story of Elijah‚Äòs visit to the widow at Zarephath, God asked the prophet to visit the widow as she would feed him in the drought. Now remember its severe drought and widows in the ancient Jewish society were the poorest as they had very less means of income. This poor widow was collecting sticks to possible cook her last meal, she and her son were going to eat this last meal and die of starvation after that.
Now we see Elijah almost being insensitive to her when he asks for water and a meal. He said bring me water, and while she was going to fetch it ‚Äì he said bring me a meal. It appears as though God brough Elijah all the way to Zarephath just to be mean to this poor widow.
Not so, when she shared her difficulties ‚Äì Elijah said to her,
‚ÄúDo not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son. 14 For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.‚Äù 1 Kings 14:13
This widow heard God‚Äôs word and acted on it, she did as the prophet told her and her household had food for many days the jug of oil did not fail nor was the meal emptied.
Elijah initially seemed mean but he wasn‚Äôt, he was just trying to test the widow and help her build up her faith. God is kind and loving and sometimes tests our faith not to insult us or to trouble us ‚Äì but to help our faith grow so we can receive the Miracle.
Don‚Äôt we even recall Jesus doing such a thing in the incident with the Canaanite woman.
The Canaanites were gentiles and when she followed Jesus asking for the deliverance of her daughter ‚Äì Jesus seems to be mean when he said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not right to take the children‚Äôs bread and throw it to the dogs.‚Äù She said yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master‚Äôs table. Jesus answered ‚ÄúO woman, great is your faith. Be it done for you as you desire‚Äù and her daughter was healed immediately. Here we see that Jesus kinda lead the women to have deeper stronger faith, his initial words seems mean but it made her stronger and built her faith.
So the next time we feel that we do not get what we want and are being pushed to the limit, let us remember that there is a Miracle waiting on the other side of our trials. Have faith!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 166 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 17:10-16
By being more concerned about his hunger and not caring about the widow‚Äôs problem, Elijah sounds like a selfish man. But Elijah was testing the widow‚Äôs faith in God. The widow, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah, a man of God, and the promise of his Lord. Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family.

The poor widow was not successful in her material life, yet she gave all that she had, unselfishly, even though she was left empty handed and not sure when her next meal was going to come. She willingly gave because she wanted to please God, even if it meant that she would have to starve.

The widow was a shadow of Mary (the widowed mother of Jesus). Mary too was not successful in her material life, yet she took care of the Son of God and unselfishly gave up her only Son because she wanted to please God.

The poor widow willingly gave her tithe to the man of God, in the form of food, and God multiplied the flour and oil so that the jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran dry.

The flour was a shadow of the Eucharist (of which it is an ingredient) and the oil was a shadow of the priesthood (priests are anointed with oil).

If we are generous in giving our tithes to the Church to support the men of God (the priests) then God will bless us abundantly (2 Corinthians 9:6-8) and our parish will always have sufficient priests to provide us with the Bread of life (Eucharist) as long as we live.

1 Kings 18:41-46
King Ahab and his wife Jezebel had killed all the Lord‚Äôs prophets and they also wanted Elijah dead (1 Kings 19:10). Ahab had even sent his man Obadiah to search for Elijah all over Israel and in all the neighboring nations (1 Kings 18:10), and yet Elijah shared the Word of God with the same Ahab, and prayed to God to give them rain, inspite of facing persecution, opposition, slander and subversion from the same King Ahab.

Elijah did not take revenge on Ahab and Jezebel. He knew that he had to forgive his offenders if he wanted God to forgive him his sins. Elijah was a man of God, a mediator between God and man, and by forgiving his offenders, inspite of what they had done to him, he set a great example for his congregation.

Like Elijah, let us always remember to forgive our offenders irrespective of how much they have hurt us. Let us not think of retaliating or taking revenge in any way.

"Forgive us Lord, as we forgive those who sin against us" (Matthew 6:12).

1 Kings 19:1-8
Elijah was re-living the experiences of Moses and his people in the old Covenant, as a shadow to be fulfilled by Christ and his people in the new Covenant.

1.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah saved himself from the cruel queen and took refuge at Mount Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God, just as Moses saved his people from the cruel king and took refuge at Mount Sinai/Horeb, the mountain of God.

1.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus saved us from Satan and gave us refuge in the Temple of God (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) which He offered up to God on Mount Zion.

2.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah and Moses spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

2.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

3.a) In the old Covenant, God fed Elijah in the desert with miraculous bread & water to strengthen him on his physical journey just as God fed Moses & his people in the desert with miraculous bread (Manna) & water to strengthen them on their physical journey.

3.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus gives us the miraculous water of Baptism and feeds us with the miraculous Bread of life (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) to strengthen us on our spiritual journey.

1 Kings 19:11-13
God did not speak to Elijah when there was noise and chaos around. God spoke to him only when there was silence. The strong wind, earthquake and fire were only to announce the arrival of an important person just as we use bugles, trumpets and drums for the same reason.

God does not speak to us when our lives are filled with noise and chaos. That is why it is important to sit alone in silence, for a few moments every day, and speak to the Lord so that we can build a personal relationship with Him, just as we build a personal relationship with our family and friends by talking to them.

Let us therefore try to avoid filling our lives with secular music and too much carousing.

##### Day #167 The sound of sheer silence

We read about the 'God encounter' of Elijah on the mountain. The angel told Elijah to stand on the mountain and wait for the Lord.
Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; 12 and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. 13 When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Elijah?‚Äù 1 Kings 17:11-13
Elijah would have anticipated that the Might God, creator of the world would come with great splendor, with thunder, fire, smoke, and lightning. He looked for God in the wind, the earthquake, the fire, but when he heard the sound of sheer silence, he wrapped his face and went out of the cave and stood at the entrance, then there was a voice that spoke to him.
It's the same with us, our lives are so full of noise and busy schedules that we are unable to calm down to hear God‚Äôs voice. We seem to be preoccupied with so many things, planning for the future and sometimes dwelling too much on the past, that we do not create space for the Lord to speak to us. We are running from pillar to post and don‚Äôt have time for the Lord. We need to allocate quiet time with the Lord, where we can have a heart-to-heart conversation with Jesus. Let‚Äôs put Jesus on our schedule, maybe an hour of adoration once a week. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we can hear God talk to us anytime, however it is clearer when we quiet our hearts and pay full attention. When Elijah heard the sound of silence ‚Äì it was his "Theophany" moment when he realizes that he was in the presence of God Almighty. The ‚Äúsound of silence‚Äù is one of those sounds where you know that it‚Äôs an out-of-this-world experience, you just know ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to explain what the presence of the Lord feels like.
The Psalmist invites us to ‚Äúthis still‚Äù state.
He says, ‚ÄúBe still, and know that I am God; Ps 46:10
Jesus constantly took his disciples away from the crowd to a quiet place
Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, ‚ÄúCome with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.‚Äù Mark 6:31
Jesus himself went away from the crowds and the disciples to pray. Jesus would send the disciples away and have personal time with Abba Father and usually woke up before everyone to pray.
And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed. (Mark 1:35)
Let us also make this a habit, let us have a quiet time and space to pray. A time for some sacred silence and meditation. Let us follow Jesus's instruction to go inside your room and pray.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
Once we heard the voice of God, we will always be able to tune ourselves to the small still voice that tells us right from wrong. Many of us already know that still small voice that comes from within, telling us right from wrong.
This song really helps me when I try to enter into that sacred place with the Lord.
May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

##### Wicked Kings

[![Wicked Kings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day168.jpg)](https://youtu.be/92MMUzHBMJg "Wicked Kings")

##### BIAY Day 168 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 21:1-29
Buying and selling of property in Israel was not allowed because the land which the people had received was a gift from God, and yet, King Ahab wanted to buy Naboth‚Äôs vineyard. Naboth however refused to sell it because he was a righteous man, who faithfully followed the laws of God. Therefore Ahab, upon advice from his wife, arranged for Naboth to be stoned to death.

In this passage we see injustice done to Naboth but the culprit (Ahab) was spared because he repented.

Why does God allow the innocent ones to die cruel deaths at the hands of wicked people?
This has been a very common question since thousands of years.
But before we start being judgemental about God‚Äôs justice, we must first ask ourselves, ‚Äúwhose sins caused Jesus, the innocent and sinless son of God, to be scourged and crucified?‚Äù

In a covenantal relation it is always the innocent ones who have to pay the price for the sins of the wicked ones, because the death of an innocent person brings about a transformation in the life of a wicked person, as in the case of Ahab. God may not always send official prophets and priests to transform the wicked, like He did with Ahab. He may just stir up their conscience to bring about the change.
God‚Äôs grace flows when an innocent man dies in peace at the hands of the wicked (as in the case of Naboth) or when the innocent man forgives his offenders before dying (as in the case of Stephen / Acts 7:59-60).

If we are baptized in Christ, then we must be prepared to suffer and die like Christ to bring about a change in someone, and God may use us to bring about that change.
God‚Äôs justice against the wicked will be satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous. If God is just, He is also merciful. God in His justice said the price for our sins has to be paid, but God in His mercy said He would pay the price because each one of us is precious to Him.

God‚Äôs Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). When we are baptized we become missionaries and soldiers of Christ. We are sent into this world for a short period of time, to carry out our mission and return back to our kingdom. Our duty is to stand on the spiritual battlefield every day of our lives and fight the evil forces, represented by humans, while we carry out God‚Äôs mission on earth, whatever we may have been called to do for the growth of God‚Äôs Kingdom

As soldiers of Christ we must always remember that a battlefield is not a comfort zone. Therefore we must be prepared to face attacks from the evil ones. It may be in the form of insults, humiliation, criticism, rejection, false accusations, injustice, any kind of suffering or even giving up our lives, etc., but, like Naboth, we must always be obedient to God‚Äôs commandments to the end.

When Satan comes with his deceptive offers of comfort and pleasure and twists our minds, we often tend to forget our true mission and we start building our nests on earth, and then, when we face negative situations, we are clueless about why things are happening the way they are and how to respond according to God‚Äôs Will.

We therefore need to start questioning ourselves:

Have we started the mission which we were sent here for?
Are we even aware of what our mission is?
Did we ask God to help us find our mission?

In this passage, Naboth was a shadow of Jesus, and Ahab was a shadow of us sinners. Naboth was also a shadow of the innocent people of God who die at the hands of the wicked, and Ahab was a shadow of the wicked people.
God allows this to happen so that one or more lost souls can be brought into His kingdom.
If we look at Naboth‚Äôs case from the worldly point of view, we see injustice done to him. But if we look at his case from God‚Äôs point of view, then we see God‚Äôs victory through Naboth (1 Kings 21:29).

We will all die according to the expiry date which God has set for us. It is not important for us to focus on living a long life and, however much we try we cannot increase our life span even if we go to the gym every day and eat healthy food.
What is more important is whether we have been successful in bringing souls to the Kingdom of God during our lifetime, not by force but by doing God‚Äôs Will. And if our death can bring at least one soul to God, then our life is worth living (James 5:20).

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

##### Day #168 The Sin of Omission

The sin of omission is failure to perform an action or a duty.
We read about King Ahab who wanted to buy Naboth‚Äôs vineyard ‚Äì which Naboth did not want to sell, rather could not sell as per the Jewish law. No one owned property but were only tenant‚Äôs and the property belonged to the family.
Ahab was being a baby about not getting the vineyard and refused to eat. His wife Jezebel took matters into her own hands and sent out letters in the Kings name. She sent out letters to elders and noble men from Naboth‚Äôs town to bring false charges against Naboth and have him killed.
The sin of omission that they committed was this ‚ÄúSo the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth‚Äôs city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. ‚Äù
They should have not accepted to lie and bear false witness against Naboth. Their failure to act justly, would eventually cost Naboth his life. This even caused God‚Äôs just judgment on Ahab, his family, and everyone under him.
In the same way, we should not be silent when something wrong ihappens in front of us. We cannot look the other way and expect things to be okay. We need to say something if we see something. The silence of good men is worse than the bad deeds of evil men. This quote has become rather famous now.
‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing,‚Äù
We are called to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
13 ‚ÄúYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
14 ‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Mat 5:13-16
We have to let our light shine in the dark places of the earth. We cannot let sin and evil prevail on earth and do nothing about it. For example, we cannot be quiet when unborn babies are legally being aborted with taxpayers money or let children be sexually abused by grown-ups. We cannot be silent, this is the sin of omission. We need to speak the truth in love and with a lot of care. We also commit the sin of omission when we fail to proclaim the Gospel, we we fail to love our neighbour in need.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 169 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 22:7-8

\*But Jehoshaphat said, ‚ÄúIs there no other prophet of the LORD here whom we might consult ?‚Äù The king of Israel answered, ‚ÄúThere is one other man through whom we might consult the LORD; but I hate him because he never prophesies anything favourable about me, but only disaster. He is Micaiah, son of Imlah.‚Äù\*

The king of Israel, chose to turn to false prophets because they always prophesied what he wanted to hear. He always avoided Micaiah who was a man of God because the king was not obeying God‚Äôs commandments and therefore Micaiah never prophesied anything pleasing to the king.

Many of us are like the king of Israel. We don‚Äôt like to obey God‚Äôs commandments and then we get angry with or try to avoid people who correct us when we are wrong, instead of taking it as a message from God and trying to change ourselves. We also try to avoid going to Church because we are constantly reminded to change our sinful way of life. We prefer to move around with and follow people who say things that are pleasing to our ears. Thus, like the king of Israel, we allow our pride to lead us on the road to Hell by listening to and following the wrong people.

This attitude of God‚Äôs people in the new Covenant, was prophesied 2,000 years ago (2 Timothy 4:3-4).

##### Joash Is Crowned

[![Joash Is Crowned](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day169.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1s5GrR4rmmM "Joash Is Crowned")

##### Day #169 Protecting the children ‚Äì they are the future

When Athaliah was about to murder all the heirs of the Kingdom of Judah, Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered. Once Athaliah was slain, they made the 7-year-old kid Joash King. There is an important lesson to learn from Jehosheba who helped save an heir to the throne and those elders who guided the young King to rule.
There are other times in the Bible where the infants have been hidden away, like Moses in the basket on the Nile(and in Pharoah's palace) and even baby Jesus was taken by Joseph and Mary to Egypt.
The lesson to learn is we need to protect the children, from all harm. We need to help shape their minds and build up their faith, make them capable of leading a nation.
Make them leaders of the nations, holy leaders who will stand up for what is holy and true.
Even Jesus in his public ministry uplifted the children, in a time when children had little value.
People were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them; and when the disciples saw it, they sternly ordered them not to do it. But Jesus called for them and said, ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Luke 18:15,16
Also Jesus warns us about leading the children into sin.
If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. Mat 18:6
We live in a generation that has committed great sins against children. We have seen so many pedophile cases and so many kids have been abused even before they reach the age of reason. In many cases the adults who are supposed to care for them, end up abusing them. It's shocking to know that parents, guardians, clergy, teachers, grandparents, scout leaders, coaches, and the list goes on, have actually abused little kids which have impacted the kids for life.
Feel so grateful for those good teachers, parents, grandparents, coaches, clergy, and youth ministers‚Ä¶.who sacrifice their lives to care for the young, they help build up the next generation. For there are far more good people than bad.
Let us be guardians to the kids in our world today, and be role models through our life examples.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![Joash's Downfall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day170.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jon_hCeYFRo "Joash's Downfall")

##### Day #170 Having a good mentor will keep you on track.

We see the good leadership of Joash for some time, remember he was the young kid who was hidden away when the royal family was murdered. His Good leadership lasts as long as he had good counsel from Jehoiada. Once Jehoiada died there was no one to guide King Joash - the king listened to the princes of Judah who lead him to idol worship. The Lord sent prophets for him to turn back but to no avail. Then the Lord permitted the army of the king of Damascus who had a smaller army to defeat Joash and leave him wounded. Joash‚Äôs own servants kill him in this wounded state to avenge the blood of Jehoiada‚Äôs son. The big difference is Joash was not buried with the kings but Jehoiada was buried with the Kings. Joash did not receive the honor of a good King even though he started off well.
The importance of good guidance is amplified in this life story of Joash. It is just so important to receive the right guidance, without it we can lose sight of the goal and miss the mark very easily.
It‚Äôs not easy to see one‚Äôs own error, that is why the Psalmist prays.
But who can detect their errors? Clear me from hidden faults. Ps 19:12
We need help from mentors, spiritual fathers, and counselors ‚Äì those who can prayerfully guide us and point out our mistakes. Just as prophet Nathan showed King David his mistake and John the Baptist told Herod his mistake. We need people in our lives to guide us and correct us. We need earthly shepherds who can help us hear the voice of the good shepherd.
‚Äúmy people are destroyed from lack of knowledge‚Äù Hosea 4:6
Let us pray for the Lord to lead people into our lives, mentors who can lead us on the right path. Those who can help us grow and correct us when we go wrong.
May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

##### Elijah and Elisha

[![Elijah and Elisha](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day171.jpg)](https://youtu.be/msLcjLtd9MI "Elijah and Elisha")

##### Day #171 A double portion of the Spirit

If we recall, Elijah threw his cloak on Elisha and made him his disciple. Elijah was Elisha‚Äôs mentor and guide. It was time for Elijah to go up to the Lord, literally go up. He is the second person recorded in scripture who did not die. (Do you know who is the first person? Enoch ‚Äì who walked and walked until the Lord took him up) Elisha did not want to let go of Elijah, Elijah asked him to tarry many times but Elisha just didn‚Äôt listen.
Finally, Elijah asked Elisha ‚ÄúAsk what I shall do from you before I am taken from you‚Äù
And Elisha said, ‚ÄúI beg you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit.‚Äù 1 Kings 2:9
Usually, the eldest son inherited a double share of his father‚Äôs property, since Elijah was his spiritual son and hence wants a double portion of the spirit. Elijah recognized that this was something that is not his own, but the Lord‚Äôs gift, that is why he said ‚Äòif you see me taken up then you have the double spirit‚Äô. Our God is more generous than we can imagine, he gave Elisha his request. Elisha saw Elijah going up by a whirlwind. Elisha called out to his spiritual father ‚ÄúMy father, my father‚Äù. Then Elisha took Elijah‚Äôs cloak that was fallen ‚Äì possibly the same cloak that Elijah put on Elisha when we called him. Elisha now has a double portion of the spirit, he performs miracles like Elijah(parting the water) and more amazing stuff coming up.
The thing to learn from Elisha is that ‚Äì we should not sell ourselves short. We are children of God and can do anything. We sometimes become timid with spiritual asks and just ask for small things. We should be bold and expect more from God. Our God is willing and will bless us far more than we can imagine. Just try being bold and ask in faith. Jesus will bless us with the good things we need to extend the Kingdom of God. Ask for the gifts of the Spirit, healing, deliverance, for the gift of knowledge, and wisdom.
Be bold Be brave and ask for a double portion by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 171 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

2 Kings 2:9-10

\*When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, ‚ÄúTell me what I may do for you, before I am taken from you.‚Äù Elisha said, ‚ÄúPlease let me inherit a double share of your spirit.‚Äù Elijah responded, ‚ÄúYou have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it will be granted you; if not, it will not.‚Äù\*

Elijah had many prophets following him.
Just as the oldest son in Israel got a double portion of the father's property along with authority, Elisha wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit, which means Elisha wanted to be the primary or main prophet after Elijah, so that he could serve the Lord twice as much as Elijah served. God granted Elisha's request and during his lifetime, Elisha performed many more miracles than Elijah.

When we ask God for blessings for the purpose of glorifying Him, He will bless us abundantly.

Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind and his disciple was given a double portion of his spirit.

Jesus too was ‚Äútaken up‚Äù (Acts 1:2, 11, 22), and He later gave His Apostles His Spirit to live by and to share it with us, to guide us in our journey on earth.

Psalm 72:9

\*May his foes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust.\*

Bowing down and licking the dust was a form of punishment for the enemy just as the enemy was punished in the beginning by God‚Äôs lowering the enemy‚Äôs status and making him lick the dust (Genesis 3:14).

Bowing down and licking the dust was very humiliating for the enemy.

##### Day #172 For when I am weak, then I am strong

Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Amaziah had done. He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success. 2 Cron 26: 3,5
Everything was going great with Uzziah as he was following the mentoring of Zechariah and sought the Lord before he did anything. God gave him success and he was doing great as a King, won battles and his fame was spreading become he was becoming very powerful. He had everything a good successful king should, armies, fertile lands, weapons, towers‚Ä¶
But, the big But was he become powerful and proud.
But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. 2 Cron 26: 16
When he was young and weak he sought God for everything, but as he grew powerful he wanted to take matters into his own hands. Even despised God‚Äôs commandments and took the place of the Levitical priest- by burning incense.
We see that he was struck by leprosy on the forehead- almost instantly and it lasted till the day he died.
One thing we can learn is to be humble and rely on God always. Even if we get wiser, richer stronger, we should not rely on our own merits but trust in the Lord. Sometimes I feel it‚Äôs better for us to stay weak and in need of God, lest we forget God.
Just like St Paul we don‚Äôt like to offend the Lord with our sin, ask the Lord to take away the thorn from our flesh/(sins or weakness or limitation) God may give us the strength to overcome it, or else may reply as He did to St Paul ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, power is made perfect in weakness‚Äù
To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Cor 12: 71-10
Let us not be too puffed up when people say good things about us or when we become stronger in our faith, lest we fall into the sin of Pride. Let us be humble and accept our weakness knowing that when we are weak then we are strong because we rely on God‚Äôs grace and not on our own strengths.

##### Day #173 Elisha‚Äôs double portion ‚Äì double Miracles

We remember that Elisha asked for a double portion of the spirit of Elijah and the Lord granted it. Was doing an internet look up and there was a compiled list of the Miracles done by the two prophets. Interestingly Elijah performed 8 while Elisha performed 16. At least these were the ones recorded in scripture.

ELIJAH'S 8 MIRACLES:

1. Shut up the heavens causing a drought (1 Kng 17:1)

2. Multiplied flour and oil for a widow (1 Kng 17:14-16)

3. Raised a widow's son from the dead (1 Kng 17:17, 22-23)

4. Defeated the prophets of Baal with fire from heaven (1 Kng 18:25-38)

5. Brought rain to end the drought (1 Kng 18:41-45)

6. Destroyed 51 soldiers with fire (2 Kng 1:9-10)

7. Destroyed second batch of 51 soldiers with fire and lightening (2 Kng 1:9-11-12)

8. Parted the waters of the Jordan River (2 Kng 2:8)

ELISHA'S 16 MIRACLES:

1. Parted the waters of the Jordan River (2 Kng 2:14)

2. Purification of the water source for Jericho (2 Kng 2:18-22)

3. Protection of the prophet by two she-bears (2 Kng 2:23-25)

4. Water for the army of Israel and success over the Moabites (2 Kng 3:16-25)

5. Providing the widow's oil (2 Kng 4:1-7)

6. Elisha's annunciation prophecy for the woman from Shunem (2 Kng 4:8-17)

7. Resurrection of the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kng 4:18-37)

8. Purified the poison soup (2 Kng 4:38-41)

9. Multiplication of loaves (2 Kng 4:42-44)

10. Healing of Naaman (2 Kng 5:1-19)

11. Gehazi cursed with a skin disease (2 Kng 5:25-27)

12. Miracle of finding the axe (2 Kng 6:1-7)

13. Capturing a band of Aramaeans by striking them blind (2 Kng 6:8-23)

14. Prophesizing relief from the enemy and the famine (2 Kng 6:24-7:20)

15. Prophesizing the death of Ben-Hadad and the rise of Hazael (2 Kng 8:7-15)

16. Prophesizing that Israel's defeat of King Hazael of Damascus (2 Kng 13:14-19)

Of all the Miracles one of the important ones is the feeding of the 100.

42 A man came from Baal-shalishah bringing food from the first fruits to the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack. Elisha said, ‚ÄúGive it to the people and let them eat.‚Äù 43 But his servant said, ‚ÄúHow can I set this before a hundred people?‚Äù So he repeated, ‚ÄúGive it to the people and let them eat, for thus says the Lord: They shall eat and have some left.‚Äù 44 He set it before them; they ate and had some left, according to the word of the Lord. 2 Kings 4:42

This prefigures the feeding of the 5000 by Jesus and the feeding of the 5000 prefigures the Last Supper, where Jesus offers bread and wine, his own body, and blood. After Jesus' death on the cross where he offers himself to the world so that we can be saved. We now have the Eucharist where Jesus feeds the whole world. Beautiful prefiguration, starting from Moses feeding the people in the desert, - Mana from heaven, to the Miracle of Elisha ‚Äì feeding of the 100, Jesus' feeding of the 5000, and finally the Eucharist ‚Äì food for the world. Let us participate in this great Miracle of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are transformed into Jesus‚Äôs body and blood.

"Eucharist food for the world"

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 173: By Sheila

In the Book of Kings, The Resurrection of the Shunammite's son parallels Elijah's Resurrection of the Widow's Son. This miracle established Elisha as Elijah's True Successor.
In Chronicles Ahaz associated with Judah's most disgusting pagan practices. Ahaz was finally defeated by Israel and Syria but did not learn from his mistakes. Ahaz brought Judah to the lowest point.
In Psalm God gives genuine rest to those who depend on HIM. All human effort is worthless without the Blessings of the Lord.

##### The Prophet Hosea

##### Day #174 It‚Äôs sometimes hard to follow simple instructions.

Naaman had everything going well for him, he was a commander in the army a great man, and in high favor of this master. However, his problem was that he had Leprosy, which was not curable at that time. Long story short, he is at Elisha‚Äôs house asking for a Miracle. Elisha gives him a simple thing to do, he said: ‚ÄúGo, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean.‚Äù
However Naaman does not want to follow it because it is too simple, he said ‚Äú‚ÄúI thought that for me he would surely come out and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and would wave his hand over the spot and cure the skin disease!‚Äù after his servants persuaded him to follow the instruction he did and was healed.
Isn‚Äôt it the same with us, we want something extraordinary, out of this world to happen when all it takes is a simple prayer? Christ died for us and paid the heavy price, the hard work is done. He invites us to just stay close to him, and follow his instructions. However, we want to be adventurous and explore the different pleasures of this world. He calls us to rest in him and to take His yoke which is light and easy.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." Mat 11:28-30
Instead of simply following the voice of Jesus we tend to get distracted by the pleasure of the world and satan‚Äôs empty promises. Our faith life will grow drastically if we are able to do the simple yet very effective things, like going to daily Mass, praying our rosary, reading our bible, personal and family prayers, and doing acts of charity and deeds of kindness.
Instead of simply being faithful to the practices of faith, we start dabbling with the world, and its glitter. Our relationship with the Lord may end up like the example of Hosea who married a harlot, the Lord asked him to do that just so that he would experience the pain Israel caused God.
Our lives can sometimes be compared to Hosea‚Äôs harlot, who left him even though he gave her everything she so desired. Even though God gives us everything we so desire, we end up leaving the Lord for the passing pleasures of the world. Let us return to him with a whole heart, lest the Lord starts to take away the things that we like.
The Harlot of Hosea did not acknowledge that God was the one who gave her grain, new wine, oil, silver, and gold. The Lord said he would take away these things only for her to realize that it was not her lovers that gave her these gifts, it was the Lord who is the source of all things good.
This could sometimes be the case with us, the Lord may have to withhold some things from us so that we can turn to him. We may experience a health issue or a financial issue or any problem that will lead us to pray and turn back to the Lord. Because if we receive everything we want all the time we may forget the giver, who is our beautiful Lord Jesus.
Let us turn to the Lord and love Him with all our hearts. Let us not stray from his love.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 5:1-14
The waters of the Jordan River did not have any magic in them.
God wanted Naaman to sacrifice his pride which was the cause of his suffering.
Pride is the source of most sins and therefore the cause of most of our sufferings. Naaman‚Äôs pride had almost blocked God from performing a miracle in his life. If Naaman would have gone back home without dipping himself in the river Jordan, he would have remained a leper all his life.

Are we proud and boastful of our fame, popularity, position, status, etc. in society? If we are, then let us humble ourselves and come down to earth. Righteousness begins with humility. Pride blocks God from using us to work through us for His divine mission and pouring blessings into our lives.

By asking Namaan to dip himself in the river 7 times, God was making a Covenant (Sheba) with him.
Naaman‚Äôs diseased flesh was made clean and like that of a little child when he shed his pride and dipped himself in the river.

Our souls too have been cleansed of sin by the waters of Baptism, and we experience this cleansing again and again when we shed our pride, repent for our sins and receive mercy from our Lord Jesus through the Sacrament of Reconciliation when He renews His Covenant with us.

*Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, ‚ÄúGo, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean.‚Äù*
The Jordan river is a symbol of the river of life
Seven times means God was extending His Covenant to the gentile nations around Israel to purify themselves like the skin of Naaman and enter His Kingdom with thanksgiving, just as Naaman returned to Israel after he was healed, to thank the God of Israel.

2 Kings 5:15-16
Naaman came back to thank God for the blessing which he had received.
How many of us remember to thank God for taking care of us after the crisis is over?

2 Kings 5:19-27
Elisha had refused the gifts from Naaman, but greed entered the heart of Elisha‚Äôs servant (Gehazi) and when he saw that Naaman‚Äôs expensive gifts were refused by Elisha, he followed Naaman, lied to him and got some of the gifts for himself.
Gehazi had desired to accumulate wealth for himself and for his descendants but instead he got leprosy for himself and for his descendants.
Leprosy was a symbol of sin and accumulating material goods is the result of sin (greed).

No matter how much wealth and possessions we accumulate in this life for ourselves and for our descendants, our wealth and possessions will not be able to give us and our descendants eternal life. It is only our relationship with Jesus and our holy life that will save us from Hell. And it is only the spiritual nourishment which we give our descendants that will save them from Hell.

God blesses us with success to share it with others. Accumulating it four ourselves brings curses into our lives for ourselves and for our families. Gehazi was just an example. Let us not fall into the temptation of accumulating earthly gifts.
Let us always try to be an Elisha, not a Gehazi.

Hosea 1:2-9
Hosea was not only called to deliver the Word of God to the immoral people who were committing physical and spiritual adultery, but he was also called to be a symbol of God to those people, while his unfaithful bride was a symbol of unfaithful Israel whom Satan always tried to take away from her groom with his deceptive offers.
Hosea was a humble man and a faithful husband even though his wife was leading an immoral and adulterous life. Therefore, through Hosea's life God wanted Israel to have a living example of how faithful God was to His people even though they were running after false gods and leading ungodly lives, and how patiently God had been waiting for thousands of years for His bride (Israel) to come back to Him.

In the Old Covenant the unfaithful bride (the sinful Israelites) could repent but could not return home (Heaven) due to her uncleanness but in the New Covenant, God gave His unfaithful bride (the sinful Christians) the option to repent and purify herself and renew her Covenant/marriage vows with Christ, through the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and thereafter unite herself with Christ in marriage again by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) (John 6:54), during every Mass, so that she can be with Him for eternity.

At the end of time Jesus (the bridegroom) will come and take His bride (the saints of the Church) to His Father‚Äôs House (Heaven) where there will be rejoicing forever, but while the bride (the Church) is still on earth she can cover herself with a white robe only after she purifies herself.

##### Knowledge of God

[![Knowledge of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day175.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VJvuvnlK350 "Knowledge of God")

##### Day #175 The steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting

One cannot ever fully comprehend the love of God. That is why St Paul prays for us that we may have the power to comprehend the love of God, its height, breadth, length, and depth. It surpasses human knowledge, we may never be able to fully understand the love of God.
I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God Ep 3:18
The steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting, as far as the east is from the west, as high as the heaven is from the earth.
God does not deal with us as our sins desire, he is slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, he forgives all our sins, and he knows that we are merely but a wildflower that is there today and gone tomorrow.
As for mortals, their days are like grass; they flourish like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, Ps 103:15-16
He forgives us of our sins because he knows that we are weak. He casts our sin as far as the east is from the west. Let us bless the Lord, with our whole soul, heart, mind, and body.
Joining the Psalmist we should praise God and bless His name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Ps 103:1
This is such a beautiful psalm, and we should include it in our daily prayers. This song helps us reflect on the Psalm.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 6:16-17
When Prophet Elisha was surrounded by the Aramean king‚Äôs human army, who were sent to kill Elisha, Elisha prayed to God and God sent him immediate supernatural help which only Elisha could see. But Elisha‚Äôs servant could not see the supernatural help so he panicked. Then Elisha prayed to the Lord again to open the eyes of his servant so that he could see the supernatural help sent by God, and the servant saw that they were surrounded by fiery chariots and horses which the human eyes could not see. God‚Äôs army had outnumbered the king‚Äôs army.

Like Elisha‚Äôs servant, whenever we face major problems in life we usually have the tendency to focus on the earthly problem and then we either panic or we go into depression and tears or we look for quick ungodly solutions.

When we face problems created by others, we look at the person as a bad person and we react negatively towards that person. We don‚Äôt see the spiritual side of the problem because we are in the habit of living by ‚Äú*sight*‚Äù not by ‚Äú*faith.*‚Äù
We look at the problem with our physical eyes, not with our spiritual eyes.

All problems (big or small) are created by Satan to take us away from God and to make us walk on the wrong path.
On one side Satan will create problems through some of his human disciples to stir up our pride or fear.
If our pride is stirred up we end up destroying relations, property, life, etc.
If our fear is stirred up then on the other side, the evil one will send his other human disciples to give us ungodly solutions on how to get rid of the problem by doing the wrong things.

Satan does not have liberty to create any problems in our lives without God‚Äôs permission. God allows problems in our lives to strengthen our faith, to trust in Him, and to lead us on the right path to carry out His mission, which may not always be a smooth road; but instead, we focus on the problems and we miss the real point of why God allowed the problem in the first place.

In every negative situation, let us remain calm, ensure that we continue doing everything according to God‚Äôs Will, trust in Him and ask Him to help us through the problem.

It is both our faith and trust in God that enables us to experience the presence of God whom we can‚Äôt see.

The Holy Spirit, who dwells within us from the time we are baptized, is greater than any worldly power which is dominated by evil spirits (1 John: 4:4).
Therefore, in every negative situation, let us remain calm and put our faith and trust in God, not in humans, while we continue doing God‚Äôs work.

Hosea 6:1-2
When we want to sow a seed in the soil we must break the soil first to prepare it for receiving the seed. Then we sow the seed and water it.

Similarly, when God wants to sow the seed of His Word and His love in our hearts He will first break us by allowing problems in our lives. We must therefore be attentive to any problems that come our way. Once the Word is sown in our hearts, God will water it by connecting us to the right teachers who will teach us about His love through His Word.

Hosea 6:6

\*I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\*

Before offering our gifts / sacrifice on the Altar, God wants us to make peace with everyone around us and change our anger, hatred, enmity (Matthew 5:23-24), greed, selfishness, etc. into love, compassion and kindness, because we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor/brother (1 John 4:20) and we cannot receive the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ unworthily (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).

When our hearts are not driven by love and compassion for the less fortunate ones then offering the unblemished sacrifice on the Altar has no meaning because we are not being imitators of God (Matthew 12:7). The sacrifice must be offered on the Altar with the same pure, unconditional, sacrificial love and compassion which Jesus had for us when He offered Himself as a sacrifice.

##### Choosing Eternal Life

[![Choosing Eternal Life](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day176.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SoxSqFjfd7E "Choosing Eternal Life")

##### Day #176 Repent before time runs out.

We know that God‚Äôs love is steadfast, and we cannot even comprehend how great it is for us. However, does that mean we can continue in our sin and expect God to save us by a Miracle? Our God is not only the Merciful Savior but also the just judge, who will determine our eternal state based on our faith and works. Even though God‚Äôs love is from everlasting to everlasting, our opportunity to repent is limited, limited to our lifetime and opportunities we have. If we continue in our sins and die in a poor state. We will not make it to heaven, this is serious, we should repent and change our lives in time.
Because of their sinful deeds, I will drive them out of my house. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious. Hos 9:15
Many have this attitude of pushing back our repentance, repentance means a change of life. One says that once I retire, I will pray more, or once I get married, I will do this, or have excuses like I‚Äôm still young, or I am old enough to do this. We should be careful if we are pushing back our repentance, lest death catches us by surprise. The other issue that we can get into is, sin becoming a habit ‚Äì sin brings us some temporary satisfaction. If we continue to do the sin repeatedly, we may not be able to get rid of it when we want to.
They have sunk deep into corruption, as in the days of Gibeah. God will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins. Hos 9:9
If we are deep in corruption/sin and have no intention to repent the Lord will not take us out of it without our intention. We should be striving to be holy and if we fall the Lord will lift us up again, for his mercy is from generation to generation, from everlasting to everlasting. Let us be sincere in our faith and pray for deliverance from sin.
Let us make all efforts to repent today and ask God for forgiveness, lest we are caught not prepared for the return of Jesus, either at the end of times or at the end of our lives whichever is sooner. The best practice is to live in a state of grace, which means always make a confession when you commit a mortal sin and go to Mass regularly as venial sins are forgiven at Mass. On Ash Wednesday we are all supposed to think of the day we will die, we need to ask ourselves are we ready to meet the Lord, are we choosing the right things in life and are we choosing Christ in every decision we make.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Hosea 10:1-15
God's people (the Israelites) were putting their trust in humans (Hosea 7:11) and worshipping false gods (statues of creation, warriors, weapons of war, etc.) (Hosea 10:1, 9, 13). The kings were doing the opposite of what they were supposed to do and the administration of justice had fallen into corrupt hands (Hosea 10:4). God was therefore warning them that they would fall into the hands of their enemies (the pagan countries) who would take over their inheritance (land) (Hosea 10:8-10) and enslave them because their sins would separate them from God. Thus they would lose their earthly inheritance if they did not repent (Hosea 10:12).
This was a shadow of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, if we, God's people, worship or put our trust in humans (rich and powerful people) and false gods (statues of creation, money, possessions, celebrities, entertainment, weapons of war, etc.) God will leave us because of our sins, and we will lose our heavenly inheritance. Thereafter we will fall into the hands of our enemy (Satan) who will oppress us with suffering (sicknesses, problems, etc.) in our lives. If we repent and confess our sins, God will save us from our enemy (Satan) and restore our heavenly inheritance.

We can fight our spiritual enemy (Satan) by putting our trust in the true God, by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, and by fighting our earthly enemies with love, peace, prayer, fasting, etc. because we receive divine power through the sacraments.

##### Day #177 I will heal their faithlessness

As we complete the book of prophet Hosea we are left with a sense of our faithlessness and God‚Äôs faithfulness. God did everything well for us, just as Hosea did, but we like his harlot wife have left the Lord and his goodness for the temporary pleasures of the earth.
He formed us in our mother‚Äôs womb, brought us out safely into this world, even taught us to walk, healed us when we were sick, and provided for us our whole life, he lead us with cords of compassion and with bands of love.
Yet it was I who taught E‚Ä≤phraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of compassion with the bands of love, Hos 11:3,4
However, we gave in to the temptations of this world and chose sin over Christ. We even committed these sins over and over again. We even lost our identity of being God‚Äôs children, maybe we shaped our lives based on world principles or maybe we do not even have a good relationship with God or a strained relationship. Do not worry if you find yourself in this state, our God will heal our faithlessness and love us freely even though we have failed him. He will always love us and come after us with great love and compassion. Let us be found by Him.
I will heal their faithlessness; I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them. I will be as the dew to Israel; Hos 14:4,5
Let those who have ears listen and open their hearts to our compassionate God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Hosea 11:1

\*Out of Egypt I called my son.\*

Literally, God was referring to the old Israel as His son.
Israel was redeemed from idolatry and physical bondage under the Pharaoh in Egypt.

Prophetically, God was referring to Jesus, the new Israel (Matthew 2:15) and us.

Jesus was brought home to Nazareth from Egypt after the death of King Herod.

God wants each one of us, His children, to come out of our Egypt (spiritual bondage due to attachment to the world) and come home to Him (surrender).

##### Day #178 An Incomplete mission doesn‚Äôt help

Jehu seems like a good king; however, he does not complete his full work of restoring Israel to the true faith. He was very crafty and deceptive ‚Äì he asked all the people which of the 70 sons of Ahad would be a good king, and when they choose Jehu instead, he made them kill all of the sons. He even calls all the worshipers of Baal to a temple, pretending that he would pray with them ‚Äì he kills them all there. He seems to be making good progress, but he stops there.
So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit‚Äîthe worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 2 Kings 10:28
Jehu should have done two more things, destroy the worship of the golden calves and then restore Israel to the true worship of God in the temple in Jerusalem.
We can relate to Jehu‚Äôs story, as we sometimes fail to complete our spiritual goals or exercises. We quit half ways and don‚Äôt complete our mission. Sometimes people want to give up a bad habit because it‚Äôs not good for their health. For example, an alcoholic or smoker tries to quit for health reasons and doesn‚Äôt really follow through with the spiritual connection. More than just stopping the bad habit, whatever it may be, we need to replace it with something good.
So that we are able to do good things instead of evil things.
Jesus gave this teaching
‚ÄúWhen an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‚ÄòI will return to the house I left.‚Äô When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.‚Äù Mat 12: 43-45
We should not just get rid of the evil habits in our lives but welcome the Holy Spirit to come and make something beautiful in our lives. Let us not try to become just good people, but holy people. Once we give up our bad habits, we should welcome the Holy Spirit into that area, so it can be restored. Once restored we should be able to fill it up with the Goodness of God and help others overcome similar sins. We should not give the devil a chance, by being idle or empty. We should be filled with the Holy Spirit with the gifts and fruits. We should pray that we are fully restored to God.
Like St Paul, we should be able to say
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 2 Tim 4:7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Psalm 110:1

\*The Lord said to my Lord.\*

David saw a vision of Heaven and called the Messiah "my Lord" because although the Messiah was a descendant of David He was also divine.

Psalm 110:4

\*The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‚ÄúYou are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.‚Äù\*

This was a blessing given to David, a royal priest, and to all his succeeding royal priests until the end of time because he was the one who conquered Jerusalem and took back the throne of Melchizedek from the enemies.
Thus the new Covenant priesthood is linked to Melchizedek through Jesus who is a descendant of David.

Like Baptism, the ordination of a priest is an indelible bond, that is, he is a priest forever.

The priestly order of Melchizedek offered bread and wine to God in thanksgiving. But that was an incomplete offering. Jesus completed that offering by offering bread and wine to God in thanksgiving as well as in atonement for the sins of God‚Äôs people, and He commanded His Apostles/bishops to do the same.

##### Day #179 Glad to go to the house of the Lord or lazy on the couch???

We read this beautiful Psalm today where the Psalmist sets the tone of joy when it comes to going to church. We can imagine the pilgrims in ancient Israel braving the elements of nature - climbing up that mount of Zion -singing this song of Joy, ‚ÄúI was glad when the said to me let us go to the house of the Lord. ‚Äù
I rejoiced with those who said to me, ‚ÄúLet us go to the house of the Lord.‚Äù Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem. Ps 122
I pray and hope that everyone reading this has the joy and the fire in your hearts when you think of going to Mass. Where we meet the creator of the world, Emmanuel God with us, the living bread that comes into our hearts.
That being said, I‚Äôm sure we have felt lazy to go to church sometimes, or we know those who just don‚Äôt want to get up from the couch and get to church. Those who want to sleep in on Sunday or just go for a walk or go eat a heavy brunch instead of church.
Let Prophet Amos talk to us today to help us shed some of the slack and laziness.
You lie on beds adorned with ivory and lounge on your couches. You dine on choice lambs and fattened calves. You strum away on your harps like David and improvise on musical instruments. You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph. Amos 6:4-5
Prophet Amos seems to be preaching to our generation, where there is an over-emphasis on luxury and comfort. We see people choosing comfort, pleasure, experiences, sports, parties, food, holidays, fine dining, vacations over God, prayer, and Church. Heaven is a place where there will be constant worship of God, angels and saints will sing Alleluia forever. Our journey on earth is supposed to prepare us to go to heaven, we need to be a people of praise, people who love God, and church on earth because Mass is where God is truly present - Heaven on earth. If we are unable to love God on earth, heaven may not be what we actually want. Of course, God wants us to have good lives with good housing and time for rest, with feasts where we can cherish the heart with good wine and good company, BUT we need to put God first and take joy in the sabbath first. Jesus was found at wedding banquets and at parties, there was always food associated with many things Jesus did. He is not a spoiled sport; Jesus wants us to have our priorities right. We need to have joy every Sunday morning when we go to Mass. This needs to be our song ‚ÄúI was glad when they said to me let us go to the house of the Lord‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 11:1-20
In the Old Covenant, baby Joash was hidden from a cruel ruler (Queen Athaliah), rescued by an elder (his aunt) and later brought to surface few years later.
But this story is not new.

Some centuries earlier baby Moses too had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (the Pharaoh), was rescued by an elder (his mother) and came to surface few years later.

In the New Covenant, some centuries later, baby Jesus too would be faced with a similar situation. He had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (King Herod), rescued by the elders (His parents) and came to surface few years later.

But the story does not end here. Those were only shadows of the perennial condition of all Christians who are part of the mystical Body of Christ (the Church) by participation in the Holy Eucharist.

Some years later, the infant Church (the mystical Body of Christ) had to be hidden from a cruel ruler (Emperor Nero), due to severe persecution, rescued by the elders (the bishops of the Church) and brought to surface few centuries later. During this time the bishops and priests continued breaking bread (celebrating Mass) and administering the other sacraments to the congregation in secret places (private homes and underground cellars) to ensure that the Christians would be allowed to practice their faith and would not be deprived of the sacraments.
The Apostles never got a chance to break bread (celebrate Mass) in a separate Church building specially designated for that purpose.

God the Father gave us the guarantee of His divine assistance to protect the Church from the beginning (Genesis 3:15) and Jesus has given us the guarantee of His divine assistance to protect the Church to the end (Matthew 16:18). Therefore, God the Father took personal care to protect the shadows (Moses, Joash, the Temple, etc.) and the physical Body of Christ, His infant Son, when threatened by evil forces, and Jesus will take personal care to ensure that the Church (His mystical Body / His bride) will never be destroyed by evil forces.

The Church finally came to surface only in the fourth century after Christianity was officially recognized by Emperor Constantine and Christians were allowed to freely practice their faith.

The Church may not be in its infant stage now, but Christians can become targets of persecution any time in their lives due to hostile anti-Christian people. We must therefore be prepared for eternal life every day of our lives.

2 Kings 12:6-7

\*But by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had made no repairs on the the House (of God) / the Temple. Therefore King Jehoash summoned the priest Jehoiada with the other priests and said to them, ‚ÄúWhy are you not repairing the House (the Temple)?\*

Christ our King is asking us the same question, ‚ÄúWhy are you not repairing the temple of the Holy Spirit (your body)?‚Äù
Have we repaired it by confessing our sins?
If not, then let us examine our conscience so that we can go to the priest and attend to the repairs soonest.

Amos 6:1-7
Amos lamented over the fate of the rich and powerful who are destined for exile, not because of their wealth but because of their refusal to share it with the less fortunate ones, and not for their power but for their indifference to the suffering at their door.
The complacent leaders feasted on fine foods and wines, and revelled while the house of Joseph, the kingdom of Israel, was collapsing around them.

Born to the nation which God favored first, they could claim Abraham as their father, but because of their failure to give to the poor, their inheritance would be taken away.
In this world, the rich and powerful make a name for themselves (Genesis 11:4) and dine sumptuously, while the poor and needy continue to be neglected.

What about us?
Have we provided at least one poor family or person with one meal every day?
Have we sponsored at least one poor child‚Äôs education?
Do we give generously to the Church?
During the Penitential Rite of every Mass we ask the Lord to forgive us for the wrong that we have done and for the good which we have failed to do.
Have we tried to correct the wrong that we have done?
Have we tried to make up for the good which we have failed to do?

Let us check ourselves. If we haven‚Äôt done anything yet, we can still begin today.
Let us not live selfishly for ourselves and for our own nuclear families.
Let us correct our errors and start making up for the good which we have failed to do.
There are many ways to help the poor and needy. If we ask the Lord He will lead us to many needy ones.

Psalm 122:3-5

\*Jerusalem, built as a city, that is bound firmly together with a wall around it.\*
\*There the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as it was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.\*
\*There are the thrones of justice, the thrones of the house of David.\*

The Davidic princes sat on thrones to judge cases in the event of violation of God‚Äôs Law.
Like their father, David‚Äôs sons were also heirs to Melchizedek‚Äôs Jerusalem kingship as well to Melchizedek‚Äôs priesthood (2 Sam. 8:18).

David and his successors were shadows of Jesus, the royal High Priest and Judge.
In the new Covenant, the bishops (the royal priests and representatives of Christ) sit on thrones in their dioceses to judge their congregations in the event of violation of God‚Äôs Law.

##### Day #180 Relics of saints ‚Äì Elisha‚Äôs bones brought a man to life

We know that Elisha received a double portion of the anointing of the spirit of Elijah. He did many miracles while he was alive. He does this incredible Miracle after he is dead.
So Elisha died, and they buried him. Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year. As a man was being buried, a marauding band was seen and the man was thrown into the grave of Elisha; as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he came to life and stood on his feet. 2 Kings 13:20,21
What a Miracle, just try to picture it, a dead man was thrown into Elisha‚Äôs grave, and he comes to life and stands up. Wow!! This is a prefiguration of Jesus raising Lazarus to life and also a pre-figuration of everyone‚Äôs rising from the dead.
Catholics get a lot of pushback about saints and their relics and even get called out as idol worship. The main objection is why are you Catholics talking to dead people or praying to their dead bones. Here is a good reference smack right in scripture where the bones of Elisha brought a man to life. Although not everything has to be in the Bible, Jesus gave us a church and not a book. In fact, the Bible was compiled and arranged by the Catholic Church ‚Äì through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. But for those who only believe if it is in the bible ‚Äì here it is.
So when Catholics pray and touch a holy relic of the saints, they are invoking the prayers of the saint. One would argue, why pray to dead people why not pray straight to God. First of all, they are alive and not dead, they were holy people and are now with the Lord. Their prayers are very powerful ‚Äì because the prayer of the righteous person is powerful (Gal 5:16).
Before anyone is declared a saint there need to be 3 Miracles received through their intercession which are scientifically/medically unexplainable.
Try to find relics of Saints ‚Äì either first hand or second hand and pray and touch them, it has brought healing to many.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 13:19
*And the man of God (Elisha) was angry with King Joash, and said, ‚ÄúYou should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed it. But now you will strike Syria only three times.‚Äù*

When Elisha was suffering from the sickness of which he was to die, King Joash came to Elisha to receive his dying counsel and blessing.

But why was Elisha angry?
Joash saw the power of God at work through Elisha. He may have thought that once Elisha dies, his power will be gone with him. He was afraid of losing his kingdom because he had few chariots and horsemen and therefore cried out to Elisha for help.
Elisha gave him instructions and Joash followed them, though not exactly, but out of fear and not with faith.
This is what angered Elisha.

In the midst of his despair, God had given King Joash the opportunity of his lifetime, to terminate the Syrians once and for all.
Elisha gave specific instructions regarding what Joash was to do.
Joash was to take a bow and some arrows and shoot the arrow out from the East window. The power of God would be released through that act in obedience.
Then Elisha gave him a second set of instructions; to take the arrows and strike the ground.

But the king struck the ground only 3 times and stopped.
Joash may have not believed that the enemy could be destroyed by striking the ground with arrows several times. Moreover, his pride may have stood in the way. After all, he was the king. Why was he asked to strike the ground with arrows instead of increasing his chariots and horsemen to outnumber his enemy?

His lack of zeal and faith resulted in his receiving much less than what God had desired to give him. God was willing and powerful enough to remove Israel‚Äôs enemy for good, if only the King had obeyed God‚Äôs Word and done exactly what he was asked to do.

Sometimes we too make the same mistake of focusing on our problems and calculating the solutions with our human mind instead of believing in God‚Äôs Word because God‚Äôs ways are mostly strange and impossible.
Our God is able to do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine but it has to be done His way, not our way.

Amos 8:5-6
*‚ÄúWhen will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the Sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will reduce the size of the containers for measuring, add to the weights and fix our scales to practice deceit with false balances; we will buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and even the sweepings of the wheat we will sell.‚Äù*

God had commanded that no work must be done on the Sabbath and new moon days (Leviticus 23:24; Exodus 20:8) because those days must be dedicated to Him with praise, worship, prayers, good work, etc., so that His people could build a spiritual relationship with Him. If the people remained busy with their material lives on the Sabbath and new moon days also, then they would be too exhausted to build a relationship with God.

But the merchants despised the new moons and Sabbaths, the holy days of God, because they were more concerned about the prosperity of their material life and not their spiritual life.

Being slaves of mammon (wealth), in their desire to acquire wealth they reduced the poor people to objects.

Many of us, too, are like those merchants. When our earthly employer gives us a day off to spend with our families, which is a blessing from God, we are very happy, but when our heavenly Father says to relax and dedicate that same day to Him along with our families, with praise, worship, prayers, good work, etc., we have a lot of excuses and complaints.

Our sinful nature causes us to take the gifts and blessings *from God* but when we have to use the same gifts and blessings *for God* we look at them as burdens.
God's Law is given to us for our spiritual benefit which will bring us eternal happiness, but like those merchants, we too are more focused on our material life and not on our spiritual life.

God wants us to focus on helping the poor, the needy and the less fortunate ones around us, but those merchants were boldly cheating the poor unsuspecting people and using their wealth to buy the less fortunate ones as if they were commodities to be purchased.
Let us not ignore the less fortunate ones around us. Let us not live selfishly for ourselves like those merchants.

##### Jonah and the Whale

[![Jonah and the Whale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day181.jpg)](https://youtu.be/5HBq_k7mg6A "Jonah and the Whale")

##### Day 181 Try not to be reluctant like Jonah because God‚Äôs mercy is never-ending.

The word that stands out with prophet Jonah is reluctant, from starting to end. We all know the story of Jonah and the whale. He was called to go to Nineveh and preach repentance to them. But he fled the opposite way, he hopped on a ship to Tarshish. It‚Äôs not like he got the wrong ship, because the trip to Nineveh was a road trip approx. 550 miles on land, he jumped in a ship that was going 1500 miles in the other direction. He wanted to go as far away as possible from God‚Äôs calling. He is so reluctant that he wanted to run away even away from God‚Äôs presence. We know he learned that hard way ‚Äì in the stinky gut of the whale for 3 days. He finally repentant and prayed to God and God heard his voice. The Fish spat him out on dry land and the word of God came to him again, this time he obeys it.
Isn‚Äôt it the case with us sometimes, that we just don‚Äôt want to do what God is asking? We run, hide and ignore God‚Äôs voice until we find ourselves in a mess that only God can take us out of.
He goes to Nineveh and preaches ‚Äú40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown‚Äù he does not give them any details ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt even tell them what wrong they are doing, or that it is the Lord Almighty the God of Israel that has sent him.
The people of Nineveh heed the warning and with the limited knowledge that they had ‚Äì they just go on a fast ‚Äì everyone ‚Äì starting with the King is fasting and praying. God is infinitely merciful and compassionate, He repented from the evil He was going to do and forgives them.
Now Jonah is furious because he knew that God is slow to anger and abounding in mercy and would forgive them their sin. Sometimes we don‚Äôt want to see others succeed in life, we are reluctant like Jonah. We want to keep God for us and not preach God‚Äôs mercy to the whole world. We are happy with our lifes and do not want to take the trouble or be uncomfortable for the sake of the Kingdom.
God appoints a plant to grow and it gives Jonah some shade, a worm destroyed the plant overnight and the plant died. This made Jonah angry again, and the Lord used this plant to help Jonah understand compassion. Jonah had compassion for a plant that he did not even plant, why should God not have compassion on the twenty thousand Ninevites who did not know thier left from their right. We usually underestimate God when it comes to compassion and mercy because we make God in our image and likeness instead of the other way around. We human beings are impatient and reluctant, angry, and do not have compassion like God. God is compassionate and merciful, far more than we can imagine. We look at sinners as gone cases, alcoholics, drug addicts, and sinful people as though they are non-redeemable. We may be the reason they are not being saved if we could just go out and preach God‚Äôs mercy to everyone ‚Äì the Lord will save them from their sin and save us from our pride.
Like the elder brother of the prodigal son, we may be hesitant to welcome back the sinner, the lost son who the father has already forgiven.
We may the vineyard workers who complain that those who were hired later in the day we're given the same wage.
Let us have some mercy and compassion for everyone in this world, let us be a little like God. He sees value in everyone no matter how bad they seem to us. Let us value everyone we meet, for Jesus lives in them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

2 Kings 15:3-5

\*He (Azariah) did what was right in the sight of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. Then the LORD afflicted the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he dwelt in a separate house.\*

Altars were built on very high places for worshipping idols. These came to be known as ‚ÄúHigh Places.‚Äù
Like his father Amaziah (2 Kings 14:3-4), King Azariah also did what was right in God‚Äôs eyes, but not like his ancestor David; the ‚Äúhigh places were not taken away‚Ä¶‚Äù People still continued worshipping idols instead of worshipping only the living God. Both father and son were generally good, but their major flaw was in allowing idolatry to continue in the kingdom, thus violating the first Commandment.

There is no point in bringing people to Christ if we are comfortable when we see them still worshipping their false gods as before.
Bringing people to Christ means constantly reminding them and insisting that they detach themselves from their false gods (money, power, entertainment, etc.), when we know that the people are still clinging to them.

It is not enough for God‚Äôs people to be good citizens. God‚Äôs people are required to be holy, which means they must surrender themselves completely to God‚Äôs Will. But when they attend worship and spend a lot of time in Church, on one side, and focus more on power, money, status, entertainment, possessions and other worldly things, on the other side, then, like the people of Israel, they are worshipping God on one side and idols on the other side.

We cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24); therefore, if we are not 100 percent with God then we are with Satan.

God allowed the king to be afflicted with leprosy for the purpose of educating his people. Leprosy was a symbol of sin. This means, by worshipping idols the people were living with mortal sins.

In the new Covenant, if we focus too much on worldly matters instead of focusing on God‚Äôs Will, then we will eventually die with mortal sins, which means spiritual death or Hell.

Jonah 1:1-4
Jonah was reluctant to go to Ninevah (in Assyria) to give them God‚Äôs message, not because he was a coward, but because he knew exactly why God wanted Ninevah to repent.
Jonah was asked by God to give the good news of deliverance, to the enemy (Ninevah), so that his beloved country (Israel) could be destroyed by them because Israel was disobeying God totally and sinking deep in sin when they should have been holier than the rest of the world, a priestly nation, the future evangelists.

How many of us would have the courage to save our enemies knowing that our loved ones could be destroyed by them even if our loved ones were doing things against God‚Äôs Will? It is no wonder that Jonah tried to escape.

Like the Israelites, we too are the people of God; a people who should be holier than the rest of the world, a priestly kingdom, the present and future evangelists.
Are we living our lives according to God‚Äôs Will, or are we too sinking in sin like the those Israelites?

When we oppose God's Will we will experience storms in our lives, and God allows that to happen to bring us back to Him.

When God has a special mission for us He will make sure His mission is accomplished through us so let us be obedient to God's call even if it is a difficult task or even if it is not matching our plans, or else we may have to suffer the consequences of our refusal.
When God has a mission for us He will ultimately take us on that path even if we try to run to the other side (Jonah 2:1 & 10).

Jonah was even willing to die (by drowning) so that God‚Äôs message would not be delivered to Ninevah, and that is why he didn‚Äôt tell the sailors to turn the boat and go back (Jonah 1:12).

Jonah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Jesus too loved us so much that He was willing to die to save us.

A great storm had hit the sea because Jonah had disobeyed God‚Äôs Word and yet Jonah was fast asleep (v. 1:5) instead of repenting and choosing to obey the Lord, while the sailors were terrified.

It could be that some people are going through misery and suffering because of our sins. Let us not be comfortable in our nest just because the misery and suffering is not affecting us. Whenever our enemies are going through suffering let us check if we have been the cause of their suffering. If we have, then let us correct our errors and repent.

Just as one man‚Äôs obedience can bring salvation to many souls, so also one man‚Äôs disobedience can bring destruction to many souls (Romans 5:19) and Jonah knew that his disobedience to God‚Äôs Word had brought this calamity upon the people around him.

Jonah 1:17
Jonah was not alive in the belly of the whale because he was speaking to God from Sheol. That is why Jesus referred to Jonah‚Äôs case as a miracle (Matthew 12:39).

Jonah 3:4-10
Jonah had delivered his message only to one-third of Nineveh (v. 3) but the news spread to the rest of the city so fast that Jonah did not even have to worry about delivering his message to the rest of the city. What a successful ministry!!!

Fasting and covering with sackcloth was a way of doing penance for sins, not only by the Israelites but, by most communities in the ancient world.
The Ninevites were pagans, not Jews, so they were not familiar with the God of Israel. Nevertheless, they reacted positively assuming that at least they had received a message from one of their gods.

Even though the Ninevites did not worship the God of Israel, God was pleased with them because of their genuine repentance and obedience to His Word.
If a non-Christian has not heard about Jesus but still worships the Creator and lives a righteous life, then he/she will definitely find favour with the Lord, just as Job (Job 1:8) and the Ninevites did.

Jonah 4:1
Jonah delivered God‚Äôs one-line message to the Ninevites, and the whole nation of one hundred twenty thousand people obeyed, repented and were saved. The most successful ministry which every missionary would dream of. But Jonah was angry at the success of his ministry, because he knew now that the destruction of Israel was definite.

Sometimes we too may feel like Jonah. We may succeed in bringing our enemies to Christ but we may get angry and not like it when we see prosperity and blessings pouring on them, specially if they had brought great harm to our loved ones in the past or if we feel that it is likely they may go away from God and become a threat to our loved ones in the future.

##### The Inescapable God

[![The Inescapable God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day182.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cYOHyne58xQ "The Inescapable God")

##### Day #182 God‚Äôs inescapable love.

Psalm 139 is my all-time favorite Psalm, it always takes me back to a warm safe place. (I stole this line from Guns N Roses ‚Äì sweet child of mine)
You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely. Ps 139:2-4
We usually tend to think of our relationship with God as something that needs to be worked on, more like ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt say my prayers, or I didn‚Äôt read the Bible today. In reality, our relationship with God is not something that we initiate but is always in response to God‚Äôs calling. For we do not even know how to pray according to Rom 8:26 ‚ÄúIn the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.‚Äù
God created us and knows everything about us, just as a scientist knows everything about the robot he programmed ‚Äì the only difference is we have free will.
God knows our every move, every thought, and feeling, and even knows our future actions. He knows when we sit when we rise and even before a word is on our lips, he already knows it. Even though God created us and knows our past present and future, he does not force His way on us, he gives us free will. He wants us to freely choose Him over the pleasure of the world.
You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. Ps 139:5,6
God has put a hedge of protection around us, angles patrol around us, and they protect us - not even letting our foot hit a stone. He is like the Father of the Prodigal son who waits for us every day to return, even though the whole world belongs to God we are his prize position, the apple of His eye. He waits for us to return to Him in prayer, He‚Äôs like a parent of a newborn ‚Äì watching every move of the baby and ensuring the baby is not harmed, feeding it on time, and caring for the baby. He loves us far more than an earthly parent can, for it was Him who created us.
For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother‚Äôs womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. Ps 139:13,14
We are all created uniquely by God, each one of us is a masterpiece of the master craft maker. Let us never feel inferior to another, every bit of us ‚Äì shape, size, color, skin tone, hair, and body structure were all made by him. We need not do anything to ourselves to be loved by him or anyone else on earth ‚Äì for we are fearfully and wonderfully made. A warning to anyone who discriminates based on color, body type, or physical beauty ‚Äì you are going against God the creation of every human being. He made everyone equal.
How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them! Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand‚Äî when I awake, I am still with you. Ps 139:17-18
God‚Äôs thoughts towards us are innumerable which means we are always on His mind. Sometimes we can feel overwhelmed that God loves us so much and knows everything about us, we may want to run away, we may want to hide like Adam and Eve ‚Äì because of our evil deeds. But where can we go from God‚Äôs Spirit, where can we run but can‚Äôt hide. We may think that we can hide under cover of sin, pleasure, laziness, comfort, money, and experiences, but can never escape God‚Äôs, inescapable love.
God does not come after us like a bounty hunter to catch us for our wrongdoings, but waits for us as the father of a prodigal son, knows our whereabouts, yet patiently and loving waits with his arms open wide for us to return.
May we all return to the warm comfort of the Father's Bosom. He is waiting for you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

2 Kings 16:3

\*He (King Ahaz) walked in the way of the kings of Israel; he even immolated his child by fire, in accordance with the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD had dispossessed before the Israelites.\*

The pagans believed that sacrificing live children to the pagan gods would bring them prosperity, and Ahaz was no exception. Ahaz belonged to God‚Äôs family but like the pagans and many other Israelites, he too desired prosperity more than his children and God‚Äôs Will.

Unfortunately this ugly story still continues to this day, which is one of the reasons for so much suffering in this world. We may not be immolating our live children to the false gods of prosperity, but, in today‚Äôs world, millions of Christians have given ‚Äúimmolation‚Äù a new name and it is called ‚Äúabortion.‚Äù Millions of unborn children continue to be aborted every year because the parents want prosperity, comfort and an easy life.

May the Lord bring those people to repentance.
May the Lord have mercy on those guilty of this crime.
May the Lord help them to come out of the darkness and walk in His light.

##### Israel Falls to Assyria

[![Israel Falls to Assyria](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day183.jpg)](https://youtu.be/15U03S2_D6g "Israel Falls to Assyria")

##### Day #183 God permits suffering when we stray from Him, only so that it may cause us to return to the straight path.

Most parents must have corrected the kids this way ‚ÄúClean your room or else no Ice cream tonight‚Äù. This is called reward-based training, something that we even follow when we train a puppy. And when the kids make mistakes, they are grounded or their toys are taken away until they learn a lesson.
The Israelites needed some tough love from the Lord, because of their continuous sins, their rebellion, and stiff-neckedness.
Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, ‚ÄúTurn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, in accordance with all the law that I commanded your ancestors and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets.‚Äù They would not listen but were stubborn, as their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah alone.
Judah also did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God but walked in the customs that Israel had introduced. The Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel; he punished them and gave them into the hand of plunderers, until he had banished them from his presence. 2 Kings 17:13,14, 18,19
The Lord after giving them numerous chances, and sending many prophets with warning messages finally just lifted His hedge from the Israelites and they were exposed to their enemies. The whole of Israelites is now away from the presence of the Lord.
This is the case sometimes with us as well, we are so pigheaded that we just want to have our way with everything. We just want to continue in our sin and gratify our cravings, give in to temptations, and just do not want to listen to God and do not want to follow His teachings. The Lord is patient, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy, however, He is a good parent as well. He will not spare the rod and spoil the kid, God will allow some suffering which will possibly cause us to think of our father‚Äôs house, like the prodigal son and we would possibly return home. Let us return to the arms of the Father.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 183 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 17:5-9 & 24

\*Then the king of Assyria occupied the whole land and attacked Samaria, which he besieged for three years. The king of Assyria took Samaria, deported the Israelites to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and at the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. This came about because the Israelites sinned against the LORD, their God by adopting unlawful practices and worshipping idols like the pagan nations around them.\*

The king of Assyria scattered the Israelites all over the surrounding pagan nations, then brought 5 pagan nations to inhabit Samaria so that the pagans could have mixed marriages with the Israelites, with the intention that the Israelites would lose their bloodline, their culture, their religion, and their allegiance to their king, thus preventing the possibility of future rebellion. These mixed descendants came to be known as the Samaritans.

After being scattered because of their sins, if the Israelites would have repented and turned back to God, then even if they had married the pagans they would have been able to bring all their pagan spouses and in-laws to God and the ten tribes would not have been lost.

Like the Israelites, we too are called to be holy. We must live our lives like Christ did. When we have mixed marriages, one of the ways we can evangelize our non-Christian spouses and in-laws is by living our Christian life faithfully so that we can bring them to Christ. But when we start living our lives like the non-Christians to please our spouses and in-laws, then, like those 10 tribes of Israel, our Christian community too will start diminishing.

Micah 5:2-3

\*But you, O Bethlehem of Ephrathah, who are one of the little clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to rule in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.\*

This was the text which led the magi to Jerusalem to look for the Messiah, but they didn't find Him in the palace. And when King Herod enquired about it his priests knew what was already prophesied through Micah.

God chose a small insignificant town for His Son to be born, and through the womb of an even more insignificant woman.

God uses less to do more. God uses something negligible to do something large.
We don't have to be famous or popular for God to use us for His divine mission. We don't even have to be experts or perfect in anything. He will use our mistakes to teach us. He only wants our "yes" for Him to start using us.

\*Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has brought forth; then the rest of his kindred shall return to the people of Israel.\*

God would hand over His people to their enemies until the time the Messiah would come into the world and deliver them from slavery.

Thus, when Jesus came to earth, Israel was physically under the oppression of the Romans because of their sins but Jesus gave them hope for liberation from spiritual slavery (forgiveness of sins) for those who accepted Him.

Micah  6:7-8
\*Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?‚Äù\*

Micah was referring to the king of Moab who offered his first born son and defeat was turned to victory. Therefore the demon-inspired people around Israel were trapping themselves into all kinds of infernal powers and thus tempted the people of God to look elsewhere for their own source of power (2 Kings 3:27).

\*He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?\*

God has already told us what He wants us to do to receive eternal life but, like those Israelites, we too choose to go our own way. God is not asking us to perform any Herculean task; all that He wants from us is to be just, kind and humble and obey His commandments.

##### DAY 183: By Sheila

KINGS: In the 12Year of King Ahaz, Hoshea reigns Samaria for 9Years. Shalmanesar attacked, settled the territory and carried away the Israelites to Assyrian Cities.
Israel's Sins: Hence began Intermarriages, the worship of idols, violation of God's Law and improper Worship of God.
MICAH: The City Jerusalem would suffer seige because of its sins. The Birth Place of the Shepherd King would be Bethlehem. By predicting a New King from Bethlehem, Micah was invoking the Covenant God made with David Centuries later, at the Birth of Jesus, where the Wise Men question, concerning where the Christ was to be born.
Judah's Kings were insecure as strength, to assure lasting peace for God's Chosen People. JESUS, The Great King Of Israel is Our Only Peace.
God would not stop with only Redeeming a remnant of Israel, theirs would be the Presence of God's people, would be to the Nation's like Life-Giving Water. The Prophet Micah revealed, they would also be like a 'lion' among the Gentiles as St. Paul describes the Church in 2 Corinthians 2:14-16.
God has a legal court case then for violation of the Covenant. He called the Hills and Mountains, who had witnessed Israel's transgressions to hear the case.
What had God done to deserve rejection of His Covenant? Had HE not Supernaturally redeemed them from slavery in Egypt?
God reminded them of events during their Wilderness Journey that revealed His Righteousness and Power.
God's people gave no explanation to His Question. God connected His people through Micah by demanding Justice, Mercy and Obedience, qualities lacking in Judah.
Messages of 8th Century Prophets: Amos called for Justice. Hosea kindness. Isaiah to obey and to walk humbly with God. Micah stated boldly that only God could right such wrong. He encouraged through suffering in Judgment was certain, it was also temporary. Micah prayed for protection too.
Psalm: The Psalmist expressed in confidence that only God can deliver from the power of evil men and punish the evil-doers.
Let's put our confidence in faith that GOD is our Deliverer.

##### Day #184 Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord

This Psalm makes for such a good prayer, that we can pray every morning.
Set a guard over my mouth, O Lord; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not turn my heart to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds Ps 141:3,4
Many people are hurt by words, it is said that words hurt harder than punches. Words have power and they can either build up a person or tear down. Most people can remember the good and bad things that were said to them, some even remember the words they heard as children. We need to be very careful about what we say, and how we say it. The words we speak can bring destruction and cause discouragement, especially to our kids and anyone under us at work, and even our family and friends.
The mouth speaks what the heart is full of and it's very easy to speak hurtful words when we are angry or upset. Words once spoken are like a bullet fired, they cannot be taken back. We are called to tame the tongue, by practicing self-control.
When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one‚Äôs life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell. James 3:3-6
Beautiful examples like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth, the rudder, and the ship, and the spark and the forest should help us realize that a small word spoken out of hate can cause a relationship to be set on fire, or a ship to sink, if we lose control of our tongue we will lose control of the whole body ‚Äì like the bits in the horse‚Äôs mouth.
Let us pray and ask the Lord to guard our mouths, and keep watch on our lips.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Hezekiah's Prayer

[![Hezekiah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day185.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ykiLZLMDkMY "Hezekiah's Prayer")

##### BIAY Day 185 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 19:9-36
When the king of Assyria threatened to attack Judah, King Hezekiah was very disturbed.

King Hezekiah was very devoted to the Lord and therefore whenever he was in fear or distress he immediately went to the Temple and prayed to the Lord. Inspite of having his royal advisors he wanted the eternal divine perspective on the situation and the path forward for him. He didn't want to look at things from the limited human perspective and worry about them as they appeared to him. He therefore didn't go to his advisors to ask for advice. He wanted to see things as God saw them. He went to the Temple to remind himself of who is really in control and who alone can truly help him. And God showed him a vision of how, in the past, with His power God had delivered His people from their enemies who were even stronger than the king of Assyria. Thereafter King Hezekiah put himself in that picture as a victorious king.

King Hezekiah's prayer is a great example for us to follow. He did not pray to God for self-preservation or for the preservation of his people and the Temple. He prayed to God to make their small kingdom victorious over the powerful nation so that God's name could be glorified in the world. Thus, by glorifying God's name in the world, salvation would come to the world.

When we are in fear or in distress, let us depend on God to make His power known to the world. Let us not place our trust in our wealth or in humans.
Let us focus on the salvation of the world and not just on the salvation of ourselves, our families and our communities.

Psalm 143:8-10
*Let me hear of your steadfast love in the morning, for in you I put my trust.*
*Teach me the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.*
*Save me, O Lord, from my enemies; I have fled to you for refuge.*
*Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.*
*Let your good spirit lead me on a level path.*

If we spend time with the Lord in the morning, He will deliver us from our enemies/evil, He will teach us to do His Will through the day and He will send His good Spirit to lead us.

Jesus also prayed in the early hours of the morning.

##### Day #185 How to approach God when we have an impossible situation on hand.

After a lot of bad Kings, we see Hezekiah, a somewhat good king of Judah. Hezekiah has this impossible situation on hand because Sennacherib the king of Assyria who defeated all the bigger nations in the area is now planning to attack this little nation and they send a letter mocking Israel‚Äôs faith in God. When Hezekiah received the letter, he responded by going to the House of the Lord, he spread out the letter in front of the Lord and prayed and asked the Lord for His intervention in this seemingly impossible task at hand. He then summoned the remnant from the North, remember they had not come to Jerusalem to worship due to the divided kingdom. Now many people came to the temple from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and Judah to celebrate the feast of Passover. Those gathered just wanted to pray and worship God. Praying together was so good that after 7 days of community prayer, they wanted to pray for 7 more days. May we be blessed with this spirit of perseverance in prayer.
This is such an incredible way to approach God when we have tough decisions to make or impossible tasks at hand. Just go to the House of the Lord and spread out/surrender the problem/ situation. Seek God‚Äôs guidance and intervention in the situation. Also, another lesson to learn here is to seek the community‚Äôs prayer ‚Äì we see that most of Israel come together to pray. We are not meant to live this Christian life alone.
We are the body of Christ; one member cannot say it does not need the other just like a leg cannot say I do not need the hand. We are one body in Christ and if one member suffers the whole body suffers. Let us share our problems with the local Church community and seek their prayers and support. Also, the Local Church community is not alone, we are all part of the Catholic Church and the Catholic Church on earth is not alone, for we are connected to the Church Suffering and the Church Triumphant. The Church militant is the Catholic Church on earth, the Church suffering is the Church in purgatory and the Church Triumphant are all those who made it to heaven, the saints. We the Church ‚Äì militant, suffering, and triumphant are all the body of Christ and He is the head. There is nothing to fear and we can never be alone, for we have a great church ‚Äì a large multitude and an even greater God who knows everything about us and already has our prayers in the works. He is moving forward ‚Äì before us working things out for us. Let us not forget to request the church to pray for our intentions, and not fear because God cares for us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 185 By Sheila

KINGS: The siege of Jerusalem describes a Second Attack on Judah after a lapse of time, the fact that Sennacherib was reconquering them. Assyrian Conquerors often led captives by means of hooks in their noses (2 Kings Verse 28)
The Mercy Seat: Inspite of Sennacherib's threat, Hezekiah prayed to the One who dwells between the Cherubim.
YOU ARE GOD, YOU ALONE. Of all the Kingdoms of the earth, Heaven and earth is Yours. Incline and hear the words of Sennacherib to reproach The Living God.

Isaiah's Prophecy: Although Assyria would occupy the Land and reap it's crop, Judah would not be entirely destroyed. Like a plant that lies dormant, Judah would appear conquered but would again bear fruit. Sennacherib's death is a fulfillment of Prophecy.
CHRONICLES: Hezekiah and all Israel and Judah celebrated the Passover Feast. The celebration of Passover, thus recalling the escape from Egypt, The escape especially from the hand of the Kings of Assyria and where there is sin, repentance and restoration may also be found. (Chronicles 30:6-9).
PSALM: "CRY OUT" For a favourable hearing from God or forgiveness in order that HE would not be overwhelmed with HIS Judgment.

Let us pray and know that none is righteous before GOD.

##### Struggles with Self-Interest

[![Struggles with Self-Interest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day186.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XaJcTFlVvBU "Struggles with Self-Interest")

##### Day #186 The danger of sharing your problems with everyone.

In the day and age of social media and high tech, posts and tweets can reach a really large audience. The ease at which you can reach an audience has its positives and negatives. Almost everyone has their cell phone always with them, people post stuff anytime and in different mindsets/emotional states. We need to be very careful about our privacy settings and the content that we post, if we post all our problems on social media, we run the risk of exposing ourselves to people who could use that information to exploit us in the future or to take advantage of us. So always pray before you post anything and be very cautious about what you post.
In today‚Äôs readings, we see this pretty good King Hezekiah make a mistake by showing everything to the Babylonians. It‚Äôs worth reading the whole story.
At that time King Merodach-baladan son of Baladan of Babylon sent envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. Hezekiah welcomed them; he showed them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory, all that was found in his storehouses; there was nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, ‚ÄúWhat did these men say? From where did they come to you?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have come from a far country, from Babylon.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhat have they seen in your house?‚Äù Hezekiah answered, ‚ÄúThey have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them.‚Äù
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, ‚ÄúHear the word of the Lord: Days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your ancestors have stored up until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says the Lord. Some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away; they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.‚Äù 2 Kings 20:12-19
Hezekiah‚Äôs mistake will cause the whole nation to suffer and the Babylonians will carry away all of their positions and even his sons will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Let us learn a lesson from Hezekiah, let us be wise in what we post on social media. Also we should be wise with what we share with our friends and colleagues. Also what we share with our pastor or counselors, just telling them stuff is different from making a confession. Nothing shared in the sacrament of confession will be shared outside because the sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." Be careful when you are sharing stuff with a prayer partner or a group leader be careful about what you share. Share what is necessary and let the Holy Spirit guide you.
Let us not be like King Hezekiah who showed everything and brought disaster to Israel. Let us be controlled in what we post and say.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 186 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Kings 20:6
King Hezekiah was mortally ill (2 Kings 20:1) but God extended his life by 15 years because of Hezekiah‚Äôs righteousness (obedience) and because he repented (2 Kings 20:3). Thus by extending Hezekiah‚Äôs life God gave him another chance and during the next fifteen years God blessed Hezekiah with a son who would be his successor to the Davidic throne.

But instead of being thankful and giving glory to God for his extended life, Hezekiah's heart was filled with pride and he started boasting about his achievements and treasures to strangers (the Babylonians) who later attacked his country to grab those same treasures, which may have been out of greed or envy.

There may have been some time in our life when we thought it was going to be our end due to some serious illness or a calamity, etc., but we miraculously survived. If God says that we will die soon because of our sins, He could change His plan and extend our lives if we repented, just as He did with Nineveh (Jonah 3:10), or He could be giving us a chance to repent after we recover, and the illness or calamity, etc. may have been a warning.

In such situations we must remember that God does not extend our life for us to enjoy it and waste it by continuing in our sinful ways. God will extend our life because He wants our life to be part of His divine plan, which was disrupted because of our sins. Therefore, after we overcome the illness or calamity, etc., we must ensure to repent and ask God to help us know His Will for us.

Of course, if we still ignore God‚Äôs Will or refuse to repent after we recover, God will definitely find another way to accomplish His divine plan, but if He has given us a second chance, we would be foolish to ignore His blessing and we would be walking towards our eternal destruction.

On the other hand, if we have led a life that is holy in God‚Äôs eyes, and we have survived a serious illness or a calamity, etc., then it may have been either for our spiritual healing or because God has a special mission for us.

Let us also be careful about what and how much information we share about our personal & private lives with others. Boasting is an act of the devil therefore we do not know which of our listeners it will cause to burn with envy, greed or revenge.

##### Praying for Time

[![Praying for Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day187.jpg)](https://youtu.be/INb2hRyPxqE "Praying for Time")

##### Day #187 Praying for more time to live

King Hezekiah was on his death bed when he prayed for more time. The Lord gave him 15 more years of life, but did he make it count. He absolutely failed with those 15 more years, we can recall how he exposed the secrets of the Kingdom of Israel in yesterday‚Äôs readings. He also was filled with a lot of pride, considering all the possessions as his own rather than the Lord‚Äôs. He also had a son Manasseh in those last 15 years, who turned out to be one of the worst kings.
He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, following the abominable practices of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he erected altars for Baal, made a sacred pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them. He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, ‚ÄúIn Jerusalem I will put my name.‚Äù He built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. He made his son pass through fire; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and with wizards. 2 Kings 2:21
The deeds of Manasseh are even unimaginable ‚Äì sacrificing his own son to pagan gods.
Sometimes when we push our way with the Lord, God accepts our request and gives us another chance. We need to make the most of it rather than do more evil. When we pray for more time to live or for healing or for a problem to resolve, we should remember to become better persons after the prayer is answered.
We see many people praying prayers like ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will donate $100 to a charity‚Äù these prayers are more of a bribe. Or should we pray prayers like ‚Äì ‚ÄúGod if you heal me, I will give up this evil habit‚Äù No the correct way to pray is ‚ÄúLord I will give up this evil habit whether you heal me or not because it draws me away from you". Let us become better children of God every time we receive a blessing from Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Book of the Law

[![The Book of the Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day188.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rP44kIbiNBc "The Book of the Law")

##### Day #188 Avoid the near occasion of sin.

In today‚Äôs proverb, we can find some good advice about living a chaste life. The example given is about a young man who seems to have gone the wrong way. The author of the proverb looks out of the window of his house and notices a senseless young man among the simple. This youth seems to be walking the streets and looking for this woman. This woman is not a harlot, but a married woman dressed like a harlot. The woman‚Äôs husband has gone on a long journey, and she seems to be on every street corner trying to seduce the youth.
Now no one knows if this story is true or not, but the takeaway for us should be the warning. The young man needs to be careful about the path he takes, for he may take a path that has trapped many and led them to hell. Let us read this warning for ourselves and be warned.
With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death. Prov 7: 22-27
Now, this can be taken literally and is very relevant to our generation, where there are so many extramarital relationships. I assume that most of us reading this do not struggle with the sin of marital fidelity, we can apply this to any sin. The devil is a roaring lion roaming everywhere, trying to find someone to devour. We have to be careful not to entertain sin too much or the near occasion of sin, lest the devil will afflict us/devour us.
Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour. 1 Pet 5:8
We also need to guard ourselves against our flesh, for if we do not be careful, we can easily fall into sin.
If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.‚Äù Gen 4:7
This warning was given to Cain, we should also heed it and master our flesh and sin.
Let us be watchful in prayer and avoid the near occasion of sin. Sin can arise from the world, the flesh, or the devil, let us be aware and vigilant and heed the warning of the author of the proverb.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #189 Wisdom is better than gold

If you were asked to choose between a large amount of money and God, what would you pick?
Would you be satisfied with all the wealth and comforts this world can offer? I don‚Äôt think that perfect health, wealth, beauty, stuff, or people can ever satisfy us, if it was so then all the rich people would be happy all the healthy people would be joyful, and all the beautiful people would feel whole.
We all are created to be loved by God and only in Him will we be complete.
Now the path to the whole life/holy life is what prepares us to be complete/whole/satisfied/fulfilled. It is the journey that shapes us like a diamond that needs to be chiseled and polished to shine its best, we are being formed in our spiritual lives every day, through every challenge/situation/difficulty/sickness/God‚Äôs word/God experience.
One reason for us not growing in our spiritual lives could be ‚Äúwe love sin too much‚Äù. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil, we need to be able to hate our sin, rather than take pleasure in it ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier said than done ‚Äì because our flesh is drawn towards gratifying ourselves.
We need to seek wisdom more than we seek things of this world, we need to make an effort to learn from the Lord. Seek instruction rather than silver and knowledge rather than gold. We should dwell in prudence and find knowledge in discretion.
However, all this knowledge should be governed by wisdom and a willing spirit.
Knowledge is knowing stuff, but wisdom is knowing what to do with the knowledge and a willing spirit is what helps us to do the things we are called to. ‚Äì Michael Eltham ü§£
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold;
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. I, wisdom, dwell in prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
I have counsel and sound wisdom, I have insight, I have strength. Pr 8:10-14
When we seek wisdom we will have counsel, insight, and strength to do the will of the Lord
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

2 Kings 23:1-25
Hilkiah found the Book of the Law (2 Kings 22:8), Shaphan read it to King Josiah (2 Kings 22:10) and a great spiritual revival took place in the whole country. All idols (Baal, Asherah, Molech, etc.) and evil practices were destroyed and people were restored back to God by renewing the Covenant.

We too are called to do the same.
Let us stop idolizing our jobs, money, positions, possessions, talents, etc.
Then let us renew our Covenant with God by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) and the Eucharist (Communion) regularly.
Let us reform ourselves first, and then reform the little community around us by reading the Word of God and sharing it with our families, friends and neighborhood.

2 Kings 23:29
Inspite of all the spiritual revival which Josiah brought about, in the end he made a mistake by taking his own decision, instead of consulting God, before deciding to go into battle, thus causing his own destruction.

Whenever there‚Äôs an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is always strong resistance from the demonic.
When things start going well for us and we are walking with the Lord, Satan steps in with flatteries and extra appreciation thus making us a little over-confident. We gradually develop pride and end up in Satan‚Äôs team. Satan does it so smoothly that we don‚Äôt even realize when and how we ended up walking with him.

Let us therefore be guided by God‚Äôs Word in all we do and say and apply it to our lives every day. Let us not make the error of misusing God‚Äôs Word to fit our agenda.

##### Day #190 Lack of Wisdom can lead to our downfall

Wisdom was the first thing that was created even before the heavens and the earth was created. Wisdom is so critical, that the lack of it can lead to our downfall. We need to constantly attune to wisdom, and ask the Holy Spirit to lead us ‚Äì for Wisdom is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. Happy is the one who is led by the Holy Spirit, who carefully listens to the voice of God.
‚ÄúAnd now, my children, listen to me: happy are those who keep my ways. Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord; but those who miss me injure themselves; all who hate me love death.‚Äù Prov 8:32-34
We see the example of King Josiah ‚Äì who is this good King who is instrumental in celebrating Passover like never before.
‚ÄúNo Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Judah has kept such a Passover‚Äù 2 Ch 35:18
Even though he was such a good King he failed to listen to wisdom, to God. Now Pharaoh Neco was at war and King Josiah went out against him.
But Neco sent envoys to him, saying, ‚ÄúWhat have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to hurry. Cease opposing God, who is with me, so that he will not destroy you.‚Äù But Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megiddo. The archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, ‚ÄúTake me away, for I am badly wounded.‚Äù So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. There he died, and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 2 Ch 35:21-24
What a tragic mistake, If only King Josiah would have listened to the warning that God gave him. Judah would have had a good king for years to come. Another lesson to learn is the Lord can use your enemies to speak to you, we notice that Pharaoh Neco was the one who spoke God‚Äôs instruction. We need to have open ears to listen to the voice of God.
Let us try to attune our hearts to the Holy Spirit, and make every attempt to hear the voice of God. Have an open ear, always trying to listen to God ‚Äì God can use even our enemies to speak to us, we can hear his instruction from the place we least expect it. Just try to listen and he will speak. Happy is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Babylonian Exile

[![The Babylonian Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day191.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k_JQWIxEQqw "The Babylonian Exile")

##### Day #191 Sometimes we may need to hit rock bottom to come to our senses

The Lord led the people out of slavery and defeated the army of Pharoah ‚Äì with a lot of Miracles and wonders. God led the people of Israel out into the wilderness ‚Äì leading them by fire by night and smoke by day ‚Äì gave them leaders like Moses, Joshua, and many judges and Kings. The Lord gave them bread from heaven and provided them with everything they needed on their journey to the promised land. The Lord fought for them and defeated all nations they encountered and finally, they were given this promised land ‚Äì a land flowing with milk and honey. The Lord also gave them the most important thing ‚Äì a beautiful temple to worship ‚Äì built by King Solomon. Instead of living the good life ‚Äì they turned away from God to idolatry, were misled by the Kings, and the Israelite tribes fought against each other and were divided. Finally, they are Exiled to Babylon ‚Äì the temple is being looted and all the silver and gold are taken away as spoil.
Sometimes we need to hit rock bottom in our lives to truly appreciate the love of God. We take things for granted and assume that everything will go well with us ‚Äì we just ignore God and our relationship with him.
We are like the prodigal son who asks for his share of the property and does not want to have anything to do with the father. We are like Israelites who entered the promised land but forgot God. Just like the Prodigal son lost all his money and had to work at a pigsty or the like the Israelites who were taken prisoners by the Babylonians and the promised land plundered, with only the poor people left behind. We may experience great loss in our lives ‚Äì but this is not God wanting to take revenge. It‚Äôs God‚Äôs invitation to come back to him ‚Äì to run to the arms of the father ‚Äì to rebuild the temple in the promised land.
Maybe it‚Äôs time where someone like King Cyrus will proclaim that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go back and rebuild the house of the Lord‚Äù that "Your life will be restored"
‚ÄúThus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him! Let him go up.‚Äù 2 Ch 36:23
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

2 Chronicles 36:14-23
Due to the people‚Äôs disobedience to God‚Äôs commandments and desecration of the Temple, God allowed their enemy (the Chaldeans) to conquer Israel, slaughter many and take the survivors into exile until they completed their punishment period, that is, 70 years. Although God had left them He did not abandon them. He promised to take them back to their land (Israel) after the completion of 70 years. At the end of the 70 years God announced the fulfillment of his prophecy by stirring up the heart of a pagan king (Cyrus) and gave the Jews some hope for the future.

Physical exile was meant to teach the people how mortal sins cause us to be spiritually exiled from God. Mortal sins open the door to the devil thus bringing in suffering and misery. Only repentance and obedience to God can take us back to Him.
Exile was like prison for Israel. When they completed their sentence they would be released.

##### Day #192 Corporal works of Mercy ‚Äì Bury the dead

In today‚Äôs reading of Tobit, we see that Tobit is almost risking his life to bury the dead. It can seem kind of unnecessary to us because the person is dead. But it‚Äôs an act of showing respect for life, all life comes from God and the soul returns to God. The Catholic Church recognizes that this as an important part of one‚Äôs faith and hence is part of the 7-corporal works of mercy, which are
Feed the Hungry
Give Drink to the Thirsty
Clothe the Naked
Shelter the Homeless
Visit the Sick
Visit the Imprisoned
Bury the Dead
Tobit was one zealous person doing this mercy work, he would steal the bodies and give them a good burial. Even though he received many warnings he did not stop. In one incidence he was about to have a feast ‚Äì the food was spread out, and with the abundance of food he wanted to invite any of his people who may need a meal. His son found an Israelite strangled ‚Äì Tobit left his feast meal to go and do this act of Mercy.
During the time of Covid, many heroic people risked their lives like Tobit to give the dead a proper burial. Let us cultivate this habit of showing concern towards the family who lost a loved one, by going to the funeral, sending the family a card/flowers, or better still offering a Mass for the soul of the dearly departed.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 192 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 1:2-20
Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed during the time of Abraham, which was more than a thousand years before Isaiah was born. But although Isaiah was preaching to Jerusalem he referred to them as Sodom and Gomorrah.

The towns of Sodom and Gomorrah were blessed with flourishing prosperity, but the people squandered all their blessings by doing evil. Israel was doing the same.

The Israelites were the most blessed people on earth. They were the people to whom the Law of God was given, they had the wisdom of Solomon, and they had the Davidic kingdom of God but they squandered all their blessings on false gods, led immoral lives and ignored the Almighty God by ignoring His desire completely. They performed robotic rituals and ensured that they did everything that the Mosaic Law commanded, but they ignored the oppression and suffering of the widows and orphans whom they were supposed to care for like their own.
Eventually the children followed the example of the elders.

But Israel's story is our story.

Like them we too sometimes attend Mass like robots, we pray like robots, we observe all the prescribed festivals, etc. and we may be checking everything on the list, but we live unholy lives, we rarely go for Confession, we spend our money on false gods (entertainment, luxury goods, etc.), and we ignore God's desire by ignoring the less fortunate ones around us.

God wants us to love Him by leading holy lives and caring for the less fortunate ones around us. Thus our physical life will reflect our spiritual life and will be a blessing to all around us.

Isaiah 2:2‚Äì5
Isaiah was shown a vision of a peaceful world in the future where all people would be walking towards the new Jerusalem (the Church). A world where criminals would discard their weapons and take up agricultural tools; a world where there would be no war, but only peace because, through the sacraments, the Holy Spirit would empower the people to forgive their offenders and live the law of love.
This was God‚Äôs plan for the new earth after the Resurrection of Jesus.

Let us therefore live in obedience to God and walk in His light so that God can use us to bring Heaven down on earth.

##### Day #193 Archangel Raphael (God heals)- healing of sight to Tobit

One way to remember the Archangels is as below
‚ÄúThe Archangel of light, sight, and fight ‚Äì Archangel of light is Gabriel, sight is Raphael and fight is Michael ‚Äú
We see a mention of Archangel Raphael in the book of Tobit,
At that very moment, the prayers of both of them were heard in the glorious presence of God. So Raphael was sent to heal both of them: Tobit, by removing the white films from his eyes, so that he might see God‚Äôs light with his eyes; and Sarah, daughter of Raguel, by giving her in marriage to Tobias son of Tobit, and by setting her free from the wicked demon Asmodeus. Tobit 3:16,17
We usually do not pay much attention to the presence of angels or their actions. Almost everything in our lives involves angles, we have a guardian angel always with us, when we pray, our prayers are carried by angels and presented to God. When God wants to bring us healing or work Miracles or do anything ‚Äì Angels are dispatched with work orders. The angles are God‚Äôs army of workers, just doing the will of God. Raphael is one of the three Archangels ‚Äì who is attributed to healing and deliverance. We see Raphael is instrumental in the healing of Tobit‚Äôs sight and deliverance of Raquel. The angel's name Raphael means ‚ÄúGod heals‚Äù.
Although only the archangels Gabriel and Michael are mentioned by name in the New Testament, the Gospel of John speaks of the pool at Bethesda, where many ill people rested, awaiting the moving of the water. "An angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he lay under" John 5:1-4. Because of the healing powers often linked to Raphael, the angel spoken of is generally associated with St. Raphael, the Archangel.
Raphael is also attributed to ‚ÄúHappy meetings‚Äù because we read in Tobit that he made the meeting of Tobit and Sarah happen soon after Tobit received his sight back. Tobias was next in line - entitled to marry Sarah.
At the same time that Tobit returned from the courtyard into his house, Sarah daughter of Raguel came down from her upper room.
We can always pray to St Raphael for our healing and for those seeking life partners.
O Raphael, lead us towards those we are waiting for, those who are waiting for us! Raphael, Angel of Happy Meetings, lead us by the hand towards those we are looking for! May all our movements, all their movements, be guided by your Light and transfigured by your Joy. Angel Guide of Tobias, lay the request we now address to you at the feet of Him on whose unveiled Face you are privileged to gaze. Lonely and tired, crushed by the separations and sorrows of earth, we feel the need of calling to you and of pleading for the protection of your wings, so that we may not be as strangers in the Province of Joy, all ignorant of the concerns of our country. Remember the weak, you who are strong--you whose home lies beyond the region of thunder, in a land that is always peaceful, always serene, and bright with the resplendent glory of God. Amen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #194 Here Am I send me

The people of Israel are in a very poor spiritual state, the Lord has done everything possible for them ‚Äì he freed them from slavery, brought them forth defeated many nations, finally they entered the promised land ‚Äì a fertile land ‚Äì but still did not produce good fruit, they betrayed God and rejected His love. The prophet Isiah receives this word in such beautiful poetic form with such great symbolism.
Let me sing for my beloved
my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. Is 5:1,2
Now Isiah is called to go preach to the lost people of Israel. Isiah was given a beautiful vision of heaven.
I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. 2 Seraphs were in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 3 And one called to another and said:
‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.‚Äù
4 The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called, and the house filled with smoke. 5 And I said: ‚ÄúWoe is me! I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips; yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!‚Äù Is 6: 1-5
God is so holy that even the angels fear looking directly at God. The Seraphs covered the feet and their eyes because even they did not feel worthy to look at God or to stand in the holy of holies.
Now Isiah feels unworthy to even see that holy image, he is like Peter(When Jesus did the Miracle of the large fish catch) who said ‚ÄúI am unworthy please depart from me‚Äù. Even we should come to that realization when we sing the "Holy Holy Holy" at the consecration during Mass, for we are standing in the presence of Jesus. The host truly becomes the body and blood of Christ. The prayer before communion that we pray should come from this understanding of our worthlessness. ‚ÄúLord I am not worthy to receive but on say the word and my soul shall be healed‚Äù
We are purified like Isiah when the host touches our tongues, at the final commission at the end of Mass, we should respond as Isiah did. ‚ÄúHere am I send me‚Äù
‚ÄúWhom shall I send, and who will go for us?‚Äù And I said, ‚ÄúHere am I; send me!‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Isaiah 5:1-7
Israel was God‚Äôs vineyard.
God gave the Israelites a hilly region filled with grape vines and fertile soil.
Then He cleared it of stones (the Amalekites) and gave them His chosen priests.
He then gave them a towering Temple but the Lord received sour grapes which were not fit to make wine.
The people broke the Covenant.

They did not observe the Sabbath, they offered incense to idols, and they rejected God. Thus they separated themselves from God. God, therefore, allowed them to be conquered by their enemies.

Let us check if we have been better than those Israelites.
If we have accepted Jesus then let us check if we are in Covenant with God at all times, or not.
Let us check whether we are observing Sunday Sabbath (the Lord‚Äôs day) and whether we are offering incense to the living God or to false gods (wealth, possessions, entertainment, etc.).

Isaiah 6:1-7
\*I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, with the hem of his robe filling the temple. Seraphim were stationed above Him.\*
‚ÄúSeraph‚Äù means ‚Äúburning.‚Äù
The angels who have a spiritual fire around themselves are called ‚ÄúSeraphim angels (plural).‚Äù

\*One Seraph cried out to the other, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and earth are full of His glory."\*
During Mass, we join the angels and saints in glorifying God by singing this hymn which is their unending hymn of praise (Revelation 4:8).

\*At the sound of that cry, the frame of the door shook and the house was filled with smoke.\*
The smoke was the indication of the presence of God in the Heavenly Temple (Exodus 40:34-38; 1 Kings 8:10-11).

\*Then I (Isaiah) said, ‚ÄúWoe is me, I am doomed, for I am a man of unclean lips, living among a people of unclean lips, and yet my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!‚Äù\*
Isaiah's words are recalled by the priests, every day during Mass, before reading the Gospel. The Priest silently prays ‚ÄúAlmighty God, cleanse my heart and my lips that I may worthily proclaim the Gospel."
Since no one can see God and live (Exodus 33:20), Isaiah thought he was going to die because he had seen God.

Tobit 6:10-11
Sarah was held in bondage by a demon who was killing her husbands on the night of the marriage (also Tobit 7:1, 9-17; 8:4-9).

Like Sarah, we too may be held in bondage by the demons of the world (power, money, entertainment, revenge, etc.), although they may not be as dramatic as in the case of Sarah, and when we have the nuptial relation with Jesus by receiving Communion in a state of mortal sin, we kill our soul.

##### Tobias and Sarah Pray

[![Tobias and Sarah Pray](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day195.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mdp1sWOgqCY "Tobias and Sarah Pray")

##### Day #195 Physical intimacy is a sign and pledge of spiritual communion

We read about Tobias and Sarah‚Äôs beautiful example of keeping the marriage bed holy.
Sarah was possessed by a daemon and her previous 7 husbands were killed on the night of the marriage. But Tobias was unlike them, he was not driven by lust but had a good realization of the spiritual connection that spouses have and that God should be welcomed into every marital act by prayer.
Then Tobias remembered the words of Raphael, and he took the fish‚Äôs liver and heart out of the bag where he had them and put them on the embers of the incense. 3 The odor of the fish so repelled the demon that he fled to the remotest parts of Egypt. But Raphael followed him, and at once bound him there hand and foot.Tobit 8:2-3
How important it is to remember instruction and to follow the guidance given to us. Now the parents of Sarah had no hope, they even dug up a grave to bury Tobias.
When the parents had gone out and shut the door of the room, Tobias got out of bed and said to Sarah, ‚ÄúSister, get up, and let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety.‚Äù 5 So she got up, and they began to pray and implore that they might be kept safe. Tobit 8:4,5
Praying as a couple is vital and very important, even praying before the marital act is a good practice that will keep lust at check. It is essential to keep the spouse‚Äôs well-being in mind, this will ensure one is not operating out of lust but out of love. Praying helps invite God into the union of husband and wife, as it is a spiritual union as well. When we invite God we have to be open to life ‚Äì which rules out any forms of contraception(The Catholic Church encourages Natural family planning).
I recall this case where a couple was not able to conceive for many years, this was because they had used birth control when they didn‚Äôt want a child. After a good confession, they finally were able to conceive and bear a healthy baby. God needs to be welcome in the marital act, it is not a purely biological act ‚Äì it is spiritual as well ‚Äì as soul is created.
The below notes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church are beautiful.

2360. Sexuality is ordered to the conjugal love of man and woman. In marriage the physical intimacy of the spouses becomes a sign and pledge of spiritual communion. Marriage bonds between baptized persons are sanctified by the sacrament.

2361. "Sexuality, by means of which man and woman give themselves to one another through the acts which are proper and exclusive to spouses, is not simply something biological, but concerns the innermost being of the human person as such. It is realized in a truly human way only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and woman commit themselves totally to one another until death." 143

2362. The spouses' union achieves the twofold end of marriage: the good of the spouses themselves and the transmission of life. These two meanings or values of marriage cannot be separated without altering the couple's spiritual life and compromising the goods of marriage and the future of the family.

The conjugal love of man and woman thus stands under the twofold obligation of fidelity and fecundity.
The clear takeaway is that the Marital act is a holy act that should help sanctify the marriage. It should be in a prayerful and joyful environment. Spouses should care for one another, look out for each other‚Äôs good and be open to life.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Destruction of Israel

##### Day #196 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light

If you haven't seen one of those videos of a blind person seeing for the first time, you should - it's amazing. Imagine there is a power outage and we have no candles or generators or cell phones, we would eagerly wait for the power to come back on. because we don't like the dark.
The human race was in great darkness, the chosen nation Israel has abandoned God and are exiled, and there seems to be no light at the end of this tunnel. The Gentile nations are barbarous and worship false gods. These words of Isiah are of great importance as he is announcing the birth of Jesus our savior.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness‚Äî on them light has shined.
For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.
For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Is 9:2,4,6
There is Hope, hope in the form of a child. One would expect a Mighty King with a great army, but God‚Äôs ways are not our ways. We are given a child, an innocent baby Jesus who will liberate us not by force but by love.
He will carry our burdens on His shoulders and break the bond of sin, once and for all.
He is the light of the world that has come into darkness. A very bright light has been turned on ‚Äì we can see because of Jesus. We who were sitting in darkness have seen a great light, we who were blind can now see.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 9:1-6

\*The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; Upon those who lived in a land of gloom a light has shone.\*
In the future, the people who suffered in exile would see Jesus, the light of the world.

\*For the yoke that burdened them, the pole on their shoulder, the rod of their taskmaster, you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.\*
The yoke of the old law with more than 613 Commandments would be made light with the new law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love and the power of the Holy Spirit through the sacraments.

‚ÄúThe day of Midian‚Äù is the day when God used the judge Gideon to deliver the northern territories from Midianite oppression (Judges chapters 6 & 7).

\*For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; upon his shoulder dominion rests.\*
\*They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.\*
\*His dominion is vast and will be forever peaceful, upon David‚Äôs throne, and over his kingdom, which he confirms and sustains by judgment and justice, both now and forever.\*
This Son would be the Messiah (Jesus) who would redeem the suffering people and re-establish the kingdom of David.

Isaiah 10:5-16
God allows evil because He wants to draw some good out of it.
Assyria was an evil superpower during the 8th century BC, and God would eventually punish them for their evil deeds. But before punishing them, and because they were evil, God was using them, like a carpenter uses a saw, to punish His people, the Israelites, for living in disobedience to His commandments. But the Assyrians, in their pride and arrogance, did not attribute their success to God. They thought they were winning wars because of their physical and material (weapon) strength and their intelligence.

Because of their pride and arrogance, the Assyrians lacked the humility to realize that God was using them in His plan for salvation. Therefore they lost the chance to have a relationship with the Almighty God.

When our country is *threatened* by our neighbors, it is a *warning* for us from God that we are not leading our lives according to His Will and He is giving us a chance to repent, correct our errors and change our lives.
When our country is *attacked* by our neighbors, it is a *punishment* for us from God because we have not repented and corrected our errors inspite of His warnings.

Punishment is therapeutic. It is meant to heal us spiritually. But if we put our full faith and trust in our human strength (weapons) and in our human intelligence to protect ourselves, and we still don‚Äôt repent, then our destruction is inevitable.

The Holy Spirit who dwells within us from the time we are baptized, is greater than any worldly power which is dominated by evil spirits (1 John 4:4).

Therefore, if we are being attacked or threatened by any of our neighboring countries, we need to examine our conscience and our way of living and repent if we are guilty of sin.
Let us work hard to keep our souls purified at all times, and in every negative situation, let us put our faith and trust in God, and not in our human strength and intelligence.

Tobit 12:8
\*Prayer with fasting is good, but better than both is almsgiving with righteousness.\*
This does not mean almsgiving is more important than prayer & fasting. ‚ÄúRighteousness‚Äù means ‚Äúliving in total obedience to God‚Äù which also includes prayer & fasting. Therefore, there is no point in spending our time in prayer & fasting if we don't care about the poor and needy, and if we don't obey God completely.

##### Day #197 A Kingdom of Peace

As we read Isaiah today let us try to picture it, try to picture a wolf and a lamb at peace, the child and the snake playing together.
The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. 7 The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 8 The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder‚Äôs den. 9 They will not hurt or destroy on all my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Is 11:6-9
The Kingdom that Jesus established is a kingdom of peace, that‚Äôs what heaven is ‚Äì there is no heat or sweat, pain or death, we will be in the presence of God and everything is at peace. Jesus is the Prince of peace and His kingdom is a Kingdom of peace. So should we wait for heaven to experience this peace? we could wait but God does not want us to be desperate, worried, or anxious in this earthly life ‚Äì as we pray in the "Our Father"‚Äì ‚ÄúThy Kingdom come‚Äù we should pray for a peaceful life on earth. Jesus wants us to have peace, that is why when he met the worried disciples in the upper room Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit on them and said ‚ÄúPeace be with you‚Äù.
Let us pray for peace in our world, among nations, among families, among friends, and for a resolution of differences, so that the whole world will be at peace. ‚ÄúMay the Kingdom of Peace Come, May thy will be done‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 11:1
Isaiah saw the house of David cut down like a tree and only the stump remaining. If the roots are alive, the stump will grow new shoots.

God had earlier warned the people that those who didn't bear fruit would be cut out of God‚Äôs Kingdom, just as a fruitless tree is felled with an axe and eventually perishes (Isaiah 10:33-34) and since most of David's descendants did not obey God's Word, they perished.

David‚Äôs descendants ruled Israel for some centuries until Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians and the last king Zedekiah was taken captive by them. Thereafter everyone thought it was the end of the Davidic kingdom.

But what the people didn‚Äôt know was that all the descendants of David did not perish. God had preserved some of them along with the others in exile and as God had prophesied (Isaiah 10:21-22) the remnant eventually returned to Israel.

The stump which Isaiah saw in the vision, was the remnant of David‚Äôs descendants and through them was born Mary, who was the Mother of Jesus by flesh (Romans 1:3), and Joseph, who was the father of Jesus by the law (Matthew 1:24-25).

Isaiah 11:2-5
According to this prophecy, the promised Messiah would possess all the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit:
Wisdom, understanding, spirit of counsel, (spiritual) strength, knowledge, fear of the Lord and piety (righteousness and faithfulness).

They are the same godly gifts which we all receive when we are baptized.
They are the same godly gifts which stay with us during our lifetime when we obey God‚Äôs commandments and walk in the way of the Lord.

Isaiah 11:6-10
Isaiah saw an image of a new creation being restored in the future, a creation which will be just like the Garden of Eden when there was peace and harmony between all creation, between humans (Adam & Eve) and animals (domestic and wild) and no one was hurt, a time when no one destroyed another life, whether for food or for revenge, a time when the domestic and the wild animals all grazed together and fed on green plants (Genesis 1:30).

\*For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.\*
When these prophecies were given, the number of people who believed in the God of Abraham was exceedingly small. The vast majority of people were polytheists, and the world was covered in pagan darkness.

Today, however, the situation is very different. Half of the human race worships the God of Abraham (Muslims, Jews and Christians) and virtually everyone has heard of him. By comparison to the days of the prophets, the world is now covered by the knowledge of the Lord the way the waters cover the sea.

This did not happen by accident. It was part of God‚Äôs plan.
It also did not happen apart from Jesus of Nazareth. It was through him that the nations came to worship the God of Abraham.

\*His dwelling shall be glorious.\*
‚ÄúDwelling‚Äù or ‚ÄúTabernacle‚Äù is ‚Äúthe place on earth where God dwells with His people‚Äù as it was in the Garden of Eden.
In the old Covenant Tabernacle, God dwelt with His people only in His divinity.
In the new Covenant Temple (the Church), the Tabernacle is more glorious than in the old Covenant because Jesus dwells with His people with His Body, Blood, Soul and divinity, and will do so until the end of time (Matthew 28:20) in the form of consecrated bread (Communion).

##### Day #198 I will pour out my spirit on all flesh

The book of Joel is just 3 chapters long; however, it is power packed with so many things. Joel is a minor prophet, minor means smaller book not smaller prophet. He is preaching straight to our heart, he starts the book with instructions to teach a life lesson to all generations. The life lesson is that God is for us, loves us, and is jealous for us. A lesson that God has been doing good to us from the start, giving us everything we need, however, we turn away from God and go our own way. God wants us more than we know, God does not want us to suffer but with a heavy heart may need to send suffering our way just so that we can turn back to God.
Yet even now, says the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; rend your hearts and not your clothing. Return to the Lord, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and relents from punishing. Joel 2:12,13
We are called to repent from our evil ways, not just act like we are repentant but truly repent. We are called to rend our hearts and not our garments, to truly turn back to the Lord. We are called to not only feel sorry for what we did but to change our ways as well.
‚ÄúThe fruit of true repentance is a changed life‚Äù ‚Äì Michael Eltham üòú
If we truly repent, then God will pour out the Holy Spirit on us. In the Old Testament, only the prophets would receive the Holy Spirit, however, we have this promise that a time will come(Pentecost) when God‚Äôs Spirit will be poured on everyone. Not just the kings and prophets but the young men and the old men, the free and the slaves. We don‚Äôt have to be rich or poor, weak or strong, the only requirement is true repentance.
Then afterward I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
Even on the male and female slaves, in those days, I will pour out my spirit. Joel 2:28,29
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

\*‚ÄúI will give portents in the heavens. . . . The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood.‚Äù\*

On the day of the Crucifixion of Jesus (probable date 3 April 33 AD), darkness had covered the land (Matthew 27:45) and the moon appeared red in color, due to a lunar eclipse.
God used the heavenly bodies to give us a sign, and not for us to practice astrology.

The Catholic Church too rejects the practice of astrology.

##### Day #199 The good Christian life

The Israelites have seen terrible days they had their land invaded, there were exiled, they were plundered, they saw poverty, and they saw days of starvation where the locust destroyed all crops. Once they went through the hard times they are able to appreciate the good things better, and they are able to be more thankful and grateful.
So you shall know that I, the Lord your God, dwell in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it.
In that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the stream beds of Judah shall flow with water;
fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and water the Wadi Shittim. Joel 3:17,18
So it is with our lives, that we sometimes need to go through really tough times in order to be grateful and thankful for the good things that we have. The important thing as a Christian is to be close to God, always in the presence of the Lord, away from sin and wickedness, just like a branch cannot survive away from the vine, we should always be attached to the true Vine - Jesus. We should receive nourishment from the Vine, and eat His body and blood, the true spiritual food. Then even if we have problems or difficulties, we will be peaceful and joyful, because the Lord is on our side and we know that He is in control. We will receive the peace that surpasses understanding and joy that is beyond happiness. We will experience the good Christian life where the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Egypt, Assyria and Israel

[![Egypt, Assyria and Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day200.jpg)](https://youtu.be/n0aaotRdvJE "Egypt, Assyria and Israel")

##### Day #200 Love your enemies not because they deserve it, but because you deserve to be a child of God.

We read something shocking in today‚Äôs readings, God calls Egypt and Assyria His own, wait a minute ‚Äì Egypt was the one who held the Israelite's captives and Assyria are the enemies of Israel, both these nations are sinful, do nasty things and worship false gods. Why would God call these terrible nations His handiwork and his people?
‚ÄúBlessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.‚Äù
This may sound like a crazy thing for God to say, but even though they are evil nations they are the creation of the Lord and God knows how to bring them back, God knows how to change their hearts.
The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the Lord, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, ‚ÄúBlessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.‚Äù Is 19:22-25
God has a plan and knows that someday these evil nations will be able to respond to God‚Äôs love. We can find it very hard to see good in the people who hurt us or who are away from God. It can be frustrating to see them succussed despite the evil they are doing or the bad things they did to us. We can quickly write them off and say there is no hope for this person, they are an utter failure and God will punish them.
Let us try to be better Christians but praying and hoping for these people, hope against hope that God will change them. Jesus taught us to love our enemies, bless them, and pray for them. We will be called children of God if we do this, we should not curse our enemies like the world does but bless them because we know better, not because they deserve it but because we deserve to be children of God. Hopefully, our good example will help them change.
‚Äúbless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.‚Äù Lk 6:28
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòLove your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. Mat 5: 44-48
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Keys to the Kingdom

[![Keys to the Kingdom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day201.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pW46C2gV3tQ "Keys to the Kingdom")

##### Day #201 Papacy ‚Äì the father over the household (Prophesized in Isiah)

In order to understand the Papacy, we need to put on the lens of the Israeli Kingdom, not this 21st-century lens. The King was the supreme authority, but when he was going away, he would give all governing authority to the ‚Äúal-habbayit‚Äù he would give him this big Key that he would literally carry on his shoulder. He would have the same authority as the king, along with authority he was also given the responsibility to be a father to the people. As we read the below verses we can read about the authority and the role of the al-habbayit/stewart/father over the household.
‚ÄúIn that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots‚Äîall its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. Is 22:20-25
This prophecy is fulfilled when Jesus instituted Peter as the first Pope(Papa/Father) the ‚Äúal-habbayit‚Äù.
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.‚Äù Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Mat 16:18-20
The concept of the papacy is not something new that was introduced by the catholic church it‚Äôs seen back in Isiah. The al-habbayit who had the key which opened the gates of the kingdom and the treasury, he had the authority to bind and loose. The first pope Peter did this very role, we can see the evidence in the acts of the apostles and other letters ‚Äì they would always consult Peter on doctrine. This did not end with Peter, it was handed down to Linus, and Clement (who are mentioned in the NT).
We can trace back ‚Äì every single Pope, it‚Äôs not fiction it's history - you can find all of the 266 Popes listed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes
As we know Jesus did not give us a book, He gave us a Church. This authority was passed down even until this current day Pope. Although there have been bad Popes, there have been far more good ones. God who led Israel with good and bad leaders ‚Äì continues to lead the Church with good and bad Pope. Even Peter was not faultless ‚Äì remember he denied Jesus 3 times, but Jesus gave him a second chance and asked him if he loved him, and commissioned Peter to feed his lambs and tend his lambs. The Pope was given the keys to the kingdom to bind and lose, the church has used this authority to further explain the teachings of Jesus in the form of dogmas, canon law, teachings, catechism... A lot of inspired teachings from saints, fathers of the church, holy men, and women over the centuries are what shape and form the church teachings, they are all guided by the Holy Spirit.
Of course, the Pope does not just decide everything, there are councils and synods and various levels of prayerful discernment for something to become an official church teaching. A good example would be ‚Äì If I gave you my car keys, you could drive wherever you like but if you try to sell my car, no one will buy it because it is registered in my name. The Pope cannot make changes just as he feels inspired, just because he has the key, there needs to be an agreement with the church and with heaven.
Let us love being part of the true flock of God, the flock that has the genuine al-habbayit, the father of the household, the Papa, the Pope.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 201 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 22:15-25
Shebna was a shadow of corrupt Popes / prime ministers / shepherds in God's Kingdom whereas Eliakim was a shadow of the God-fearing ones. It is the ministry of authority that holds the fort together, therefore if God is not happy with His earthly shepherds then He will ensure that they are replaced.
This was a foreshadow of the heavenly Davidic kingdom (the Church).

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom, the ungodly prime ministers (the popes) and chief ministers (the bishops) must be succeeded or replaced in the event of their death or removal from their offices, just as it was with the earthly Davidic kingdom.

Since there was no Davidic king ruling during the time of Jesus, and since Jesus was a descendant of David and the rightful heir to the throne, choosing 12 apostles for His Kingdom meant that Jesus was reviving the Davidic kingdom, so the apostles understood that the existing King Herod and his team would have to either step down or be overthrown.
This may have been the reason why the apostles asked Jesus as to "when He was going to restore the kingdom to Israel" (Acts 1:6) because, after His resurrection, Jesus had re-confirmed Simon's role as Prime Minister (John 21:15-17). And, as the apostles rightly understood, that role was to be continued.

##### God's Judgment

[![God's Judgment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day202.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xTpub0Fj9AY "God's Judgment")

##### Day #202 ‚ÄúUnjust scales‚Äù and ‚ÄúPride‚Äù are a recipe for disaster

We read the prophecy about Tyre, which was a very rich city. We see that Tyre is increasing in wealth, it‚Äôs the center of trade and there is a lot of money and wealth and buildings and towers. However, the city is becoming increasingly corrupt and the people who live in it are very proud and unjust. All this will end in the downfall of the city of Tyre
We also see a similar situation in Habakkuk, the prophet is calling out the injustice that is happening and the consequences that it will have.

‚ÄúWoe to him who builds his house by unjust gain,
setting his nest on high
to escape the clutches of ruin! Hab 2:9

‚ÄúWoe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
and establishes a town by injustice! Hab 2:12

One thing that is clear is that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders are building in vail. If the house or city is based on evil means it will eventually collapse, when unjust measures are used the person/city/house may prosper for some time but will be ruined and not profit him much.

The LORD detests dishonest scales,
but accurate weights find favor with him.
When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
but with humility comes wisdom. Prov 11:1-2

The Lord detests the dishonest scales and those who make a profit from unjust dealings. Let us remember that all the money in the world cannot satisfy anyone, it will just leave them wanting more money/power/fame ‚Äì only the humble will find satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Our country prints ‚ÄúIN GOD WE TRUST‚Äù on the currency, but do we trust in the Lord or in riches? This statement on the currency is very helpful to keep us focused on the true source of everything good ‚Äì God himself.

Everything good comes from God. Every perfect gift is from him. James 1:17

Let us not use unjust scales or get proud when money accumulates, but in turn, humble ourselves and trust in the Lord for everything.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 202 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 24:5
*The earth is polluted because of its inhabitants, for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.*
Breaking a covenant was considered a serious crime and with their immorality, disobedience, rebellion and pride, mankind has broken the covenant which God had made with them, but God did not give mankind any severe punishment for their infidelity. Instead, Jesus took upon himself the severe punishment which we deserved for breaking the covenant.

People have defiled the earth by breaking God‚Äôs laws and by violating the covenant which He made to last forever. So God pronounced a curse on the earth. Its people are paying for what they have done.

Habakkuk 1:2-3
*O Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and thou wilt not hear?*
*Or cry to thee ‚ÄúViolence!‚Äù and thou wilt not save?*
*Why dost thou make me see wrongs and look upon trouble?*
*Destruction and violence are before me; strife and contention arise.*

The strife and discord we face in our own lives can sometimes cause us to wonder, as the prophet does, as to why God doesn‚Äôt seem to hear or intervene when we cry for help.
But let us not forget that God did not redeem us to abandon us in our trials, just as He did not redeem Israel from Egypt to let them die in the desert. He will be with us all the way through till the end, just as He was with Israel. He is our God and we are the people whom He shepherds always, though at times His mercy and justice seem long delayed.

In times of prolonged crisis we tend to think that God has abandoned us.
Unanswered prayers are one of those experiences which really put our faith to test. If we are going through some trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. it is easy to start losing faith, despair and be tempted to ask ‚Äúhow long Lord?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere are you Lord?‚Äù

If our prayers have not been answered for a long time, let us not despair, for the Lord delays because He desires to do something greater for us than what we are asking for, while we are waiting in prayer, clinging to the Lord. During this time God strengthens us spiritually.

One of the fruits of unanswered prayers is a deeper and more intense prayer. God allows us to remain in the trials, tribulations, suffering, etc. because He wants us to grow spiritually.

We may be asking for temporal good to ease the suffering but God wants our spiritual good and therefore He delays in answering.

Habakkuk 2:2-3
Habakkuk was prophesying shortly before the Babylonians would conquer Israel. His message was one of ‚Äúdoom and gloom.‚Äù It was not a popular message. God told him to write down his vision so that all could see it and prepare, or ‚Äúso he may run who reads it‚Ä¶‚Äù The idea was that if folks received his message and acted, they could be saved, for ‚Äúthe righteous shall live by his faith‚Äù as verse 4 says. It was a dark vision, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel for the faithful.
This is not a ‚Äúwrite it and it‚Äôs yours‚Äù theology as many people believe.

Habakkuk 2:4
*Behold, he, whose soul is not upright in him, shall fail, but the righteous man shall live by his faith.*

Faith is not just about believing. To have faith in God means to have belief as well as trust, and we can prove our trust in God by our works, that is, even when the world is against us.

##### Day #203 Trust and Joy in the Midst of Trouble

It is easy to Praise God when everything is going well, it could be easy to thank God for all the blessings that we have. However, when we are going through a difficult time we tend to focus on the problem and forget to thank God. We tend to make prayers of petition and make novenas or fasts for a quick resolve. All this is good but let us not forget to thank the Lord with Joy and with Trust.

Though the fig tree does not blossom,
and no fruit is on the vines;
though the produce of the olive fails,
and the fields yield no food;
though the flock is cut off from the fold,
and there is no herd in the stalls,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD;
I will exult in the God of my salvation.
GOD, the Lord, is my strength;
he makes my feet like the feet of a deer,
and makes me tread upon the heights Hab 3:17-19

In Habakkuk, we see that they have nothing to be thankful for, no produce or flock ‚Äì seems like a famine. Even though they are going through the most difficult time ‚Äì yet they rejoice in the Lord. This should be our attitude as well, pray with Trust and rejoice in all situations, especially when things are not going our way. As Christians, we should not try to run away from suffering, but a journey with it rejoicing.

yet I will rejoice in the LORD

When the apostle Paul was in prison, he wrote the letter to the Philippians. In this letter, he writes that he is rejoicing in the Lord ‚Äú I rejoiced greatly in the Lord‚Äù Ph 4:10 and we have the very famous verse as well. ‚ÄúI can do all this through him who gives me strength.‚Äù Ph 4:13. He even exhorts us to do the same.
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Ph 4:4
We see more encouragement to always rejoice and pray without ceasing in Thessalonians. We are to rejoice even in our difficulties and pray and thank God in everything. For even the difficulties are a blessing to make us holy.

"Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." 1 Th 5:16-18

While Paul and Silas were in prison they did not feel sad and sit in a corner, they prayed and sang and rejoiced. Great things happen when we are in prayer and have joy in our hearts.

About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was an earthquake, so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone‚Äôs chains were unfastened. Act 16:25,26

When we pray and sing, there are angels around us and great breakthroughs will happen. If you are going through something now, I encourage you to pray and sing and rejoice ‚Äì the Lord will set you free.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 25:6-10
\*On this mountain the Lord of hosts will provide for all peoples a feast of rich food and choice (well-aged) wines, juicy rich food and pure choice wines. On this mountain He will destroy the veil that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death forever. Then the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.\*

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, in the Upper Room on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, by giving us, through His apostles/bishops (Luke 22:19-20), the rich food of His Body and the choice wine of His Blood in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to save us from eternal death.

On the same mountain Jesus destroyed death by shedding His Blood and dying on the Cross.

There will be no more tears because through the sacraments Jesus would give His people His grace and strength to live the new law of love and overcome sufferings. Thus the people would rejoice in their sufferings instead of pitying themselves (Matthew 5:11-12; Acts 5:41; Acts 16:25).

When Jesus died on the Cross, the veil (Temple curtain) was torn in two, indicating that the barrier between God and humanity was removed. Now all people (Jews and gentiles) can worship God in His new Temple (the Church).

\*For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain, but Moab will be trodden down as straw is trodden down in the mire.\*

The Moabites were the descendants of Moab, who was one of the sons of Abraham‚Äôs nephew (Lot), and Moab was born of an illicit relation. The Moabites eventually became the ultimate enemies of Israel, the descendants of Abraham. The Moabites represent the enemy (Satan) of God‚Äôs people (Jews and Christians).
‚ÄúMoab‚Äù is one of the names used as a symbol of any and all nations that stand against God and Israel (old and new).

Isaiah 26:9-10
\*My soul yearns for you in the night, my spirit within me earnestly seeks you. For when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.\*
\*If favor is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness they deal perversely and do not see the majesty of the Lord.\*

Why does God allow evil on the earth?
God allows evil on the earth because He wants to draw some good out of it and also to humble us because of free will and due to the weakness of our souls.

When times are good we keep ourselves so busy with worldly matters that we don't find time to spend with God, and we make excuses even if we have time. Thus we end up going far from God.

God does not force us to follow Him, but He wants everyone to be saved. He desires us more than we desire Him. When we push God out of our lives the evil one gets a foothold in our lives and starts showering us with sufferings. When these sufferings become unbearable and times are bad for us due to the absence of God in our lives, we automatically run to God for help with our own free will, like the helpless prodigal son (Luke 15:14-18), knowing that our souls have become bankrupt.

It is only when we are humbled through sufferings that we realize our dependency on God because apart from Christ we can do nothing (John 15:5).

##### Zephaniah's Warnings

[![Zephaniah's Warnings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day204.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kHlo6WKF6aU "Zephaniah's Warnings")

##### Day #204 Are we just going through the motions

We read the stern warning in Isiah where the people honored God with their lips but their hearts were far from the Lord.

The Lord says:
‚ÄúThese people come near to me with their mouth
and honor me with their lips,
but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship of me
is based on merely human rules they have been taught.
Is 29:13

We need to always have a close check on our prayer life, sometimes we can get complacent and focused on the outward aspects of our prayer life without actually praying. We could be reading our Bible but not even applying it to our lives. We could be praying our prayers but not meaning them. We could be just doing charity because it‚Äôs a good thing to do but do not see Jesus in the poor.
When we pray we should remember that it‚Äôs a conversation with God, that we should not just state all our petitions and run away, but sit and listen to God as well. We should not just pray for our earthly lives, but for our souls as well. We can sometimes start off well but slowly lose sight of our relationship with the Lord. We may be saying prayers with our lips but our mind is somewhere else. Let‚Äôs try to come back to the heart of worship, it should not be about the choir or the homily, it should be about God and me ‚Äì our relationship. Like the song of Solomon, we should be deeply in love with God ‚Äì where we cannot wait to meet each other.
We are called to seek the Lord with all our hearts, mind, and strength. Remember that God is seeking us first and loving us first. We should love him with everything we have not just our lips but from our hearts.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. Mark 12:13
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Promise to Zion

[![Promise to Zion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day205.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LNwSiVB0HX0 "Promise to Zion")

##### Day #205 Fear not for God is in our midst

We know that the Israelites have been going through a rough spiritual journey and were exiled from the promised land. Imagine how fearful and shameful they must be, Zephaniah‚Äôs prophecy starts with woes but end with comfort and restoration. The restoration will happen through Jesus ‚Äì Emmanuel God in our midst, he will strengthen the weak hands, he is the warrior that went into battle for us and came out victorious, love and forgiveness were his weapons.
He now rejoices over us in gladness and he renews us in his love, exults over us with loud singing

On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
Do not fear, O Zion;
do not let your hands grow weak.
The LORD, your God, is in your midst,
a warrior who gives victory;
he will rejoice over you with gladness,
he will renew you in his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing
as on a day of festival. Zep 3:16-18

When darkness encamps you and you feel like there is no one who cares for you, remember that God is in our midst, He is Jesus, who cares for us and rejoices over us. He is our warrior who is fighting for us and if God is on our side, who can be against us?

He leads us with gentle whispering like a good shepherd he leads us to green pastures.

Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, ‚ÄúThis is the way; walk in it.‚Äù Is 30:21

He calls us by name and is pleased with us, Jesus loves us more than we can imagine.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 30:1-33 & 31:1-9
In times of trouble the Israelites put their trust in their ancient enemies, the Egyptians, instead of obeying and trusting in the Lord.
Pagan Egypt was a symbol of the evil world.

So often, in times of trouble, we too put our trust in the evil world who does not want to believe in or hear about the Lord, because we want our problems to be solved instantly and according to our plans and so we don't mind lying or we don't mind bribing our way through or using people to solve our problems illegally, because that is the normal way the world solves problems. We don't have the patience to wait for God to solve our problems because God's solutions always involve sufferings and delays.

The Lord wants us to obey Him and put our trust in Him (Isaiah 31:6) because only He can give us the perfect solution for our problems. The sufferings and delays are meant to purify us or change us spiritually, while we wait.

##### The Book of Baruch

[![The Book of Baruch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day206.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3bGZIpXDoqE "The Book of Baruch")

##### Day #206 Praying for our leaders

When we read Baruch we get a sense of desperation of the people of Israel, who are in exile and unable to go to the temple to offer sacrifice. This can be related to those times during the Pandemic when all churches were closed and we could not go to Mass. Now the people gather some money to send temple priest who could pray on their behalf and offer sacrifices. The stunning piece is that they are requesting prayers for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon who has literally kept them in exile.
10 They said: Here we send you money; so buy with the money burnt offerings and sin offerings and incense, and prepare a grain offering, and offer them on the altar of the Lord our God; 11 and pray for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and for the life of his son Belshazzar, so that their days on earth may be like the days of heaven.
We are called to pray for our rulers, our bosses, our superiors, congressmen, and all governing and political leaders.
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. 1 Tim 2:1-3
We see Paul urging us to pray for our leaders and in the below verse, we are encouraged to be good citizens.
All of you must obey the government rulers. No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule. And no one rules now without that power from God. 2 So if anyone is against the government, he is really against what God has commanded. And so he brings punishment on himself. 3 Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers. But people who do wrong must fear them. Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers? Then do what is right, and the ruler will praise you. 4 He is God‚Äôs servant to help you. But if you do wrong, then be afraid. The ruler has the power to punish; he is God‚Äôs servant to punish those who do wrong. 5 So you must obey the government. You must obey not only because you might be punished, but because you know it is the right thing to do.
6 And this is also why you pay taxes. Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work. 7 Pay everyone, then, what you owe him. If you owe any kind of tax, pay it. Show respect and honor to them all. Rom 13:1-7
We should be good citizens, follow the law and pay our taxes. Everyone needs prayers, especially our leaders. We should pray for them to have good understanding and that they make policies that are just to all. We should pray for our leaders, whether we like them or not. We should pray that their hearts will be open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Lord Will Come

[![The Lord Will Come](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day207.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gMcLeuFMo0g "The Lord Will Come")

##### Day #207 The Lord will strengthen the weak hands and firm the feeble knees

To an exiled people these words would have been as sweet as honey.
Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
Say to those who are of a fearful heart, ‚ÄúBe strong, do not fear! Here is your God. He will come with vengeance, with terrible recompense. He will come and save you.‚Äù
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy. Is 35:3-6
Jesus fulfilled this promise, the widow and the orphan are cared for the blind receive their sight. The ears of the dead are opened, and the lame are leaping for joy like a deer. The mute tongue is now open, and they cannot stop praising God.
Let this word of God speak to us today even as we may feel exiled living in this world, which is full of people who are not interested in God. Most people in the world today are very self-satisfied and self-obsessed, just trying to gratify their own needs without even thinking of prayer. Jesus and matters of faith seem far from this generation, God is removed from schools and institutions. A generation of darkness seems to be evolving.
If we Christians feel like a weak minority, we can rest assured that Jesus will strengthen our feeble hands and firm our frail knees. My dear brother and sister who pray outside an Abortion center ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe strong and do not fear Here is your God‚Äù
Let us pray that the eyes of those who promote evil be opened. Let us pray that the tongue of the oppressed be loosed so they can speak. Let the ears of those who ignore God's voice be opened. Let us be prepared for the day of the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Futility of Idols

[![The Futility of Idols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/July/jpgs/Day208.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vacu6xvrrqY "The Futility of Idols")

##### Day #208 False gods, idols, and superstition

Baruch 6 goes on and on about the false gods and idols, it seems almost repetitive. The idols made by man ‚Äì made of wood, gold, and silver have no feelings and cannot do you any good or harm. It can be hard to worship an idol for that seems kind of stupid, but some people can be fearful that those objects may have some evil power over you.
Baruch reminds us not to be fearful of those false gods and religions.
Thus is it in no way apparent to us that they are gods; so do not fear them. For like a scarecrow in a cucumber patch, providing no protection, are their wooden, gilded, silvered gods. Baruch 6:69-70
Another thing that is false is superstitions like ‚Äúcrossing paths with a black cat brings bad luck ‚Äù, ‚Äúcracked mirror brings bad luck‚Äù, and ‚ÄúA rabbit's foot will bring you luck‚Äù. These are just a few examples, but you get the idea ‚Äì placing your faith in these practices is idolatry because you believe more in the black cat/mirror/dead rabbits‚Äô foot than in Jesus Christ.

We need to recognize that every power in this world is weaker than God, the creator of the world. We should not have any fear of these false gods or idols.
The one fear that people may have, is the demonic influence on these objects. Occult or demonic influence on these objects is possible and it can affect you if you let it. The devil and the fallen angels can use anything to affect you, but that is only if you open yourself to it due to an unconfessed sin or a habitual sin that gives the devil an entry point. Let us remember that God in us is greater than any evil spirit in the world.
You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.1 John 4:4
Let us not have any superstitions or fears of evil but rejoice that the Spirit of Christ in our hearts is greater than anything else we may face.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #209 Those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength

God‚Äôs people have been in distress ‚Äì as they are exiled because of their unfaithfulness. God has not abandoned them but journeyed with them. God only wants them to change their hearts so that they can return to him. God speaks words of Comfort to Isaiah.
Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that she has served her term, that her penalty is paid, that she has received from the Lord‚Äôs hand double for all her sins. Is 40:1,2
When the word comfort is used ‚Äì one would usually think of a cool Air-conditioned room with a comfortable couch and a cool drink. But God‚Äôs comfort is to be found only in us repnting from the evil that we are doing. The comfort of the Lord can be found when we repent, rend our hearts and seek after him. The comfort of God can be found when we prepare the way for the Lord. When we make straight the paths, level the mountains and welcome God into our hearts.
A voice cries out: ‚ÄúIn the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all people shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken.‚Äù Is 40:3-5
John the Baptist was that voice that cried out in the wilderness, and the church now cries out every advent and lent ‚Äì asking us to repent and to receive God‚Äôs comfort. We are also called to repent every time we fall, we are called to repent in the sacrament of confession. Every parish cries out through its scheduled confessions every week - a call to repent.
Because once we repent and seek the Lord, He will renew our strength. He will give power to the faint, and strength to the powerless. Even if the young and strong of the world fail, those who wait on the Lord will never faint but will renew their strength. We will mount up with wings like eagles.
The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.
Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. Is 40:28-31
May you feel comfort by repenting and renew your strength today.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 209 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 40:3
\*A voice cries out in the wilderness, ‚ÄúPrepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.‚Äù\*

Isaiah was prophesying about the arrival of a prophet (John the Baptist) who would prepare the people for the arrival of the Messiah into their hearts by calling them to repentance. Meanwhile, Jesus Himself would prepare a pure vessel (Mary) for His arrival into the world because God would not enter an unclean heart or an unclean womb.

Isaiah 40:9-11
In the ancient pagan world, a king/emperor was worshipped as god, and the birth of a son, the heir to the throne, was announced as "good news" ("evangelion" in Greek) because the heir was believed to be the son of god (the king/ emperor), who would save their people from their physical enemies.

Isaiah used the same concept to announce the good news of the birth of the future king and God of Israel who would save them from their enemies and oppression.

The Jews were suffering in exile because their sins and non-repentance had separated them from God. When they repented, God promised to come down Himself, as their good shepherd king, to save them.

The Judeans did receive a king in the future who delivered them from physical exile but Isaiah was also prophetically speaking of the ultimate divine king Jesus who would save them and us from spiritual exile.

##### Day #210 Evangelization is not optional

The prophet Ezekiel has this great vision of God in all his glory. After the vision, Ezekiel is commissioned to go out and proclaim the word of God. He is asked to eat the scroll with God‚Äôs word and he is now the mouthpiece of the Lord. He has no option but to proclaim the message that he was entrusted with. He is made a watchman of the house of Israel.
‚ÄúSon of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 18 If I say to the wicked, ‚ÄòYou shall surely die,‚Äô and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. 20 Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life.‚Äù Ez 3 17-21
We read all the scenarios above in detail, Ezekiel‚Äôs job is to proclaim God‚Äôs word if he fails to do that the blood of the wicked man would be on Ezekiel. Again there may be different ways that people may respond for God gave everyone free will. But it is our duty to proclaim God‚Äôs love, saving grace and judgement on the world. God does not want to condemn the world but to save it.
If you were asked to go out and speak to others about God, you may feel insecure or hesitant. But God reminds us in Isaiah that we should not fear, for God is with us he is our help and strength.
‚ÄúYou are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off‚Äù; 10 do not fear, for I am with you, do not be afraid, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my victorious right hand. Is 41:9,10
The above verse is worth memorizing it gives us strength when said in times of fear and doubt.
Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you insect Israel! I will help you, says the Lord; your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. 15 Now, I will make of you a threshing sledge, sharp, new, and having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains and crush them, and you shall make the hills like chaff. 16 You shall winnow them and the wind shall carry them away, and the tempest shall scatter them. Isaiah 41:14-16
We will be made strong and will become like a threshing sledge that will crush mountains and hills into chaff that the wind will carry away. God will make us strong and we will triumph over every situation. Our duty is to proclaim and speak to people, God will be with us and the response is up to them. Evangelization is not an optional calling but mandatory for every Christian, if not the blood of the wicked will be on our hands.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 210 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Isaiah 42:6-7
\*I am the Lord; I have called you in righteousness; I have taken you by the hand and kept you; I have given you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations, to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, from the prison those who sit in darkness.\*

God gave the old Israel to the world as a Covenant / mediator and as a light to the nations, to make Him known and to bring the world to Him. He wanted them to open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, to release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and to be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

This prophecy was fulfilled in the Upper Room when Jesus instituted the Lord‚Äôs Supper and gave us His living Body, in the form of consecrated bread and wine, to receive Him as the Covenant between God and man, a Covenant between flesh and Spirit, a Covenant between human and divine, a Covenant between corruptible and incorruptible. Through the sacraments Jesus would open the eyes of those who were blind to the truth, He would release those who were imprisoned by unclean spirits and He would be a light to those who lived in the darkness of their sins (Luke 4:18-21).
As followers of Christ we must continue bringing people close to Christ by being a light to the world through love and generosity.

Ezekiel 2:1-5
Ezekiel lived around 587 BC, around the time when Solomon's Temple was destroyed. Ezekiel was a priest in the Temple. God commanded him to go and prophesy to the people of Israel and to warn them about the forthcoming destruction of the Temple if they didn't turn from their evil ways. By commanding Ezekiel to prophesy to a nation of rebellious people, God was commissioning him to be rejected.

Ezekiel was a shadow of Jesus. Jesus too received a similar response from majority of the Israelites, but that didn‚Äôt stop Him from preaching to the people.

The Church too has a similar mission.
When we share the Word of God with the world, we should not expect that all will accept Christ, but that should not discourage us or stop us from sharing the Word of God.
When a farmer sows seeds it is not necessary that all will fall on rich soil (Matthew 13:8).
Let us, therefore, be on the sharing side of the Word, not on the rejecting side.

Ezekiel 3:18-19
\*‚ÄúIf I say to the wicked, ‚ÄòYou shall surely die,‚Äô and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.‚Äù\*
\*‚ÄúIf you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life.‚Äù\*

When God makes us aware that someone is committing a sin and we don't correct them or stop them, then we too are guilty of sin along with them.
But if we try to correct or stop someone from sinning and they refuse to correct themselves then they will be condemned but we will be without guilt for that particular sin.

In the new Covenant, a priest saves his own soul whenever he retains the sins of an unrepentant sinner by judiciously denying absolution as a warning (John 20:23).

##### Day #211 I have called you by name, you are mine.

We are precious in God‚Äôs eyes, each one of us has been called by name. We belong to God, we are His. God created and formed us, knit us together in our mother‚Äôs wombs. God loves us so much that He will give nations in exchange for us. When we go through tough times, we will not be overwhelmed. He will redeem us, we need not fear.
But now thus says the Lord, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: ‚ÄúFear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I give Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you. 4 Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and I love you, I give men in return for you, peoples in exchange for your life. 5 Fear not, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the east, and from the west I will gather you; Is 43:1-5
We sometimes think that we decide to pray or go to church, but the desire for prayer is initiated by God. We need to realize that, God choose us first and knew us even before we knew ourselves.
16 You did not choose me but I chose you. John 15:16
Even before the prodigal son decided to come back home, the father was waiting every day for his return, Even before the lost sheep was found, the good shepherd went out to find him. In the same way even before we pray, God is initiating us and calling us. God knows us through and through, even before a word in on our lips He already knows it.
Even before a word is on my tongue, O Lord, you know it completely. Ps 139:4
Let us totally rely on God because it is he who called us, choose us, and knows everything about us. He will be with us when we go through troubles, the waters will not drown us or the fires burn us. We will not be overwhelmed but redeemed by God Himself.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #212 I will go before you

When we are asked to do something new or when change arises, we tend to fear. We feel afraid when we have a big task at hand either at work or church or at home. We sometimes feel that we are all alone and no one is supporting us. If you have chronic conditions and feel that there is limited or no medical treatment.
If you are facing any situation that makes you fearful and you have hit a roadblock, pray the below verse over and over again. For God will go before you and level the mountains, break in pieces the doors of bronze, and break the bars of iron.
‚ÄúI will go before you and level the mountains, I will break in pieces the doors of bronze and cut asunder the bars of iron, 3 I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoards in secret places, that you may know that it is I, the Lord, the God of Israel, who call you by your name. 4 For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, I call you by your name, I surname you, though you do not know me. Is 45:2-4
There will be a great breakthrough for those who pray this verse repeatedly. God will give great treasures to those who persevere and push forward in prayer. God has called us by name and surnamed us as well. Let us not fear but trust in God who goes before us.
The God who created us and knows us even before we were created, will sustain us and care for us even till our old age when we get gray.
who have been borne by me from your birth, carried from the womb; 4 even to your old age I am He, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. Is 46:3,4
As one ages they tend to feel abandoned and left out by society and family. Older people feel as though everything is ending and they don‚Äôt have anyone who cares for them. Remember that God is on your side, He cares for you ‚Äì He is the same yesterday, today, and forever ‚Äì whether you are young or old. Even if society and family leave you, God will never abandon you. Rest assured that God is on your side and he goes before you leveling all the mountains and breaking all the gates that come in your way.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 212 By Sheila

ISAIAH begins with Cyrus as God's lnstrument anointed and subdued before HIM. To break and open lron Gates, Bronze Bars. To know hidden, secret places of rich treasure no one can see.
I The Lord do all these things, even though Cyrus did not acknowledge God.
In the past, Prophets and Holy Men were anointed to do the Lord's Work. What a mighty contrast, His own people have neglected and do not carry Him. Rather they carry idols, loaded on over burdened beasts.
EZEKIEL: expresses in Prophetic Writings and refers to the Day of The Lord. A time of decisive judgement, a point of utter destruction, to those who dwell in the land. The daily routine of life as God's people would end.
PROVERBS: We eventually become that on which we allow our minds to dwell. Words can bring satisfaction when they are wise or disaster when unwise.
Let's bear words as deeds that bear fruits.

##### Day #213 Shutting God out of our lives

One pitfall to Christians would be to shut God out of certain areas of our lives. We tend to make an idol of the true God, that is we make God in our own image and likeness instead of being shaped by Him. We are clay and He is the potter, can the clay decide on its shape should be?
Sometimes we want to shut God out of certain areas of life and give into our own desires and designs.
A few examples:

1. We can decide that using contraceptives is a good practice and shut God out of our lives instead of being open to life.
2. We can decide that ‚ÄúJust being a good person will get us to heaven ‚Äì and do not have any relationship with God‚Äù
3. We can determine that there is no need to go to church once a week, just praying at home and reading your bible is enough
4. We can decide that there is no need to go to confession, I will confess my sins straight to God.
5. We can decide that Jesus is not present in the Blessed Sacrament, it‚Äôs just a piece of bread
   The prophet Isaiah warns us about this, of being self-contained and satisfied, of being our own god.
   You felt secure in your wickedness, you said, ‚ÄúNo one sees me‚Äù; your wisdom and your knowledge led you astray, and you said in your heart, ‚ÄúI am, and there is no one besides me.‚Äù 11 But evil shall come upon you, for which you cannot atone; disaster shall fall upon you, which you will not be able to expiate; and ruin shall come on you suddenly, of which you know nothing. Is 47:10,11
   We just cannot continue in our wickedness or by believing our own truth. Relativism is taking over young minds, and everyone wants to believe their own truth. It‚Äôs not about what you think or I think, it‚Äôs about what God wants for us, How does he want to be worshiped? What is He calling us to?
   God created us and knows best, let us listen to Him.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #214 Can a woman forget her nursing child?

The love of a mother is the strongest human love that anyone can experience (although there can be exceptions). A mother‚Äôs love is so great that she is ready to sacrifice her own joy for the joy of the children. She will do anything it takes to see her children succeed. We can all relate to the warm love our mothers showed us, and the care and comfort we found in her bosom. Mother‚Äôs love is demonstrated in the lovely food they made, the clean house they kept, and the hard work they did in the house and at the office as well. Mothers don‚Äôt ever take sick days; they are constantly working to keep the family happy. The love of a mother for her newborn is admirable, she will keep up all night to ensure the baby is happy. Although the love of a mother is great, there can be times when she will not be the mother she is called to be. Mothers are human as well and can have many flaws. Even if a mother will forsake her infant, God will never abandon us or forsake us.
But Zion said, ‚ÄúThe Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.‚Äù Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. Is 49:14-16
The Lord called me before I was born, while I was in my mother‚Äôs womb he named me. Is 49:1
The Lord is our true parent, He had named us even when we were in our mother‚Äôs womb. The Lord has inscribed us on the palms of His hands. We are truly loved and admired by our God. Even if everyone on earth leaves us if we are abandoned by our parents, children, friends, spouse, family, and siblings the Lord will never leave us. We can always trust God to be there for us, even if human beings leave us.
The best place to be is in the arms of Abba father. We sometimes overthink or overanalyze our faith, we just need to be held by God sometimes. He is our father and we are His Children. We will not be forgotten.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 214 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 49:1-4
The *servant of the Lord* is Jesus as well as Israel, therefore what was true for Jesus and the old Israel is also true for the new Israel (the Christians).

The Lord plans our mission on earth long before we are born and sends us to the earth to carry out that mission while we also earn our living, just as it was with Jesus.
Let us therefore ask the Lord to help us know what our mission is and surrender ourselves to Him so that He can carry out that mission through us, as He wills.
Let us glorify the Lord by sharing the Word of God with the people around us, starting with our families, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.
Let us also glorify the Lord by loving and caring for everyone including our enemies.

Let us allow God to continue working through us even though we cannot see the fruit of our efforts in the midst of an evil world.

##### Day #215 How beautiful are the feet of the messenger who announces peace

Good news is always something people look forward to, whether it is an appointment letter to your new job or acceptance to college, or to a sports team. We are eager to hear good news and always wait for the people who bring it to us. Of course, the biggest news to humanity is the promise of a redeemer, the announcement of salvation and the fact that God will reign over Zion is good news to the Israelites.
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns.‚Äù Is 51:7
However, the Israelites were expecting a King ‚Äì who would fight and destroy the nations that are keeping them captive. However God‚Äôs ways are not our ways, we will eventually be given Jesus who conquered with love. He did not come to destroy the people who were keeping Israelites' captives but to save them. He would come not to dominate and rule with force, but to submit himself even unto death, to show us 'the way of love' and 'the way of peace'.
Just as there were many who were astonished at him ‚Äîso marred was his appearance, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of mortals‚Äî 15 so he shall startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of him; for that which had not been told them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Is 51:14,15
He was the suffering servant, marred beyond recognition. Even though Jesus is God, He accepted torture at the hands of his creation. He loves us to the point where He took on our sins and our death. He suffered in our place so that we can be saved.
Your feet will be beautiful to this hurting world if you can carry this good news to them. The news that Jesus loves them dearly, even unto death.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Suffering Servant

[![The Suffering Servant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day216.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A86jWg7J1BI "The Suffering Servant")

##### Day #216 By his bruises we are healed

When we get sick or hurt, we immediately turn to medicine and the doctors to cure us. The doctors can prescribe medicine, but healing is from the Lord. We are healed by Jesus, by his bruises we are healed. Medicine and faith go hand in hand ‚Äì doctors are a gift from God, our intelligence is from God, and advancement in science and technology is a blessing if we use it in accordance with God‚Äôs will. According to OT Jewish practice sin brought disease and poverty and prosperity and health were due to a holy life. This statement is true but not a hard and fast rule for every situation, for example, the holy saints suffered even though they did very little sin and a dodgy businessman becomes rich because of his corrupt ways. One thing is sure since God is just ‚ÄúSin brings punishment‚Äù however God does not want to punish us for life, he loves us and wants us to be whole. For a brief moment, He may forsake us, but with great compassion, he will comfort us.
For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with great compassion I will gather you. In overflowing wrath for a moment I hid my face from you, but with everlasting love I will have compassion on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. Is 53:7-8
Our Redeemer Jesus has carried our sins and diseases, he was stricken, wounded, and crushed for our transgressions. He that knew no sin, has taken on all the sins of every single person starting from Adam to the last person alive. We are healed because of Jesus‚Äô suffering on the cross, by his bruises we are healed. Even though our sins should cause us sickness and punishment, Jesus took that suffering on himself. If we repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness, Jesus will not only forgive us our sins but also heal our bodies.
Surely he has borne our infirmities and carried our diseases; yet we accounted him stricken, struck down by God, and afflicted. 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his bruises we are healed. 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have all turned to our own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him with pain. When you make his life an offering for sin,
yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Is 53:4-6, 10, 12
The promise that was given to Noah that the earth will never be destroyed again by a flood is extended to all humanity. In Jesus God promises that he will not be angry with us and the covenant of peace will not be removed. Even though the mountains may depart the hills be removed, God‚Äôs steadfast love will not depart from us. God looks at humanity through the lens of Jesus, we can always find God‚Äôs never-ending love and mercy in the cross of Jesus.
This is like the days of Noah to me: Just as I swore that the waters of Noah would never again go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you and will not rebuke you. 10 For the mountains may depart and the hills be removed, but my steadfast love shall not depart from you, and my covenant of peace shall not be removed, says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
May the Holy Spirit lead us

##### BIAY Day 216 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 53:3
\*He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\*

The Sanhedrin handed Jesus over to Pilate to be crucified so that He could be hung on a tree according to the punishment laid out for criminals (Deuteronomy 21:22-23), not realising that they were fulfilling the prophecy (Isaiah 53:4-5).
The people despised Jesus because it looked to them as if God was unhappy with Him and therefore He was being punished as He deserved, according to the blessings and curses under the Law (Deuteronomy 27:11-26 & 28:1-68).

Isaiah 53:5
\*By his stripes we are healed.\*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His hard life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus our souls are healed.

Isaiah 54:1-10
Our relationship with God is like the relationship of a bride and her groom.
Therefore, God sees sin as spiritual adultery because sin is not just the breaking of a law or commandment; it is the breaking of our relationship with God because when we sin we abandon Jesus and we hold the hand of Satan (our lover).

Exile is not a divorce. It is just a temporary separation between bride and her groom, who is her provider and protector, so that when the bride starts suffering due to separation she will realize her errors, repent and return to her groom.

God doesn't abandon us when we sin; it is we who abandon Him, and we can re-unite with Him only after we examine our conscience, repent, and confess our sins.
But it seems like it will be a long time before the people will realize their errors and repent because Isaiah assures them that, although the enemy has occupied their territory, their land will not be lost. It will be recovered by their descendants. They will be gathered together in the new Covenant when God will come down on earth to stay with His people (Matthew 28:20).

Sometimes our sufferings look like they are never going to end till we die and that may be true because in all that time God is waiting for us to repent and it is we who are delaying.

Ezekiel 14:13-14
\*When a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it human beings and animals, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they would save neither sons nor daughters; they would save only their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord God.\*

This warning is not meant to cause us despair. It is meant to be an encouragement for us to pray and evangelize so that our culture does not reach the depths that is followed by judgment, as it happened with Sodom and Gomorrah.
Let us therefore get busy and spread the Word of God to everyone around us so that we can transform our ungodly culture into a godly one.

##### The Everlasting Covenant

##### Day #217 For my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples

God‚Äôs mercy is never ending and his steadfast love will not depart from us. However, in order to receive God‚Äôs forgiveness and mercy we need to seek Him, draw near to him and forsake our evil ways. We need to seek the Lord while he may be found, seek him while we are alive, and have an opportunity to repent ‚Äì once dead we cannot repent.
Draw near to God, while he is near, whenever you have an opportunity to pray ‚Äì use it and don‚Äôt lose it. If we return to the Lord he will have mercy on us and he will abundantly pardon us for any sin that we have committed. We may feel like running or hiding when we sin, but we should pray and return to God. For his ways are not our ways and his thoughts higher than our thoughts, just return to him while he may be found.
Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; 7 let the wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let them return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. 8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. 9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. Is 55
God‚Äôs thoughts are higher than our thoughts, we may condemn and put down people but God treats everyone equally. The people in Isaiah‚Äôs time would probably put down the Eunuch and the Foreigner. We should never put down people because of their sexual orientation or ethnicity. The church can determine who is in the state to receive communion(those who are in the state of grace) but as far as worshiping at Mass ‚Äì all are welcome, whether straight or otherwise, whether rich or poor, no matter what nationality one belongs to, the Catholic Church should welcome everyone, and so should every parish. The House of the Lord will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples. The church is a place not for ‚Äúsaints only‚Äù but a refuge for sinners too.
Do not let the foreigner joined to the Lord say, ‚ÄúThe Lord will surely separate me from his people‚Äù; and do not let the eunuch say, ‚ÄúI am just a dry tree.‚Äù 4 For thus says the Lord: To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths, who choose the things that please me and hold fast my covenant, 5 I will give, in my house and within my walls, a monument and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
7 these I will bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples. Is 55
Let us remember to love the Word of God, for God‚Äôs word will never return empty, it always accomplishes its purpose. Just like the rain that comes down from heaven waters the earth and brings forth sprouts, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater. God‚Äôs word is alive and active, melting our hearts as we read it.
10 For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 11 so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.

Isaiah 55:1-3
Earthly food makes us hungry again but the food which God was promising His people was supernatural food, the Bread of the Presence which was one of the key signs of the Covenant (Exodus 25:30; Leviticus 24:8).

In the new Covenant it is the Body of Christ / the consecrated bread, which is not for sale.

God was inviting His people to the Messianic banquet of the new Covenant where He would feed them with the Bread of life (the Body of Christ) which He gave to us in the Upper Room.

Isaiah 55:10‚Äì11
*For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return there until they have watered the earth, making it bring forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.*

The rain that comes down is not unfruitful and it doesn't return back to where it came from. It waters the earth to give seed to the sower so that he can grow the crop and give bread to the eater to nourish his body.

Similarly, God's Word must bear fruit. God does not withdraw His commands.
We cannot just read the Bible, meditate on the verses and close the book. We must put God's Word into action. God's Word says that we must love one another, and be kind and generous to others. We must therefore go one step further and share God's love with others by loving them ourselves, being kind and generous with others without expecting any benefits, and living faithful Christian lives so that others will be drawn to Christ by the splendour of our lives.

When God speaks, His Word does something; it brings rain, it created the world in the beginning, it gave Abraham‚Äôs barren wife a son, etc. because God's Word has power and it must bear fruit.

Likewise, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" His words transformed the bread and wine into His mystical Body and Blood (Matthew 26:26-28).

When we are in union with the Lord, our words also have power because we are created in the likeness of God.
With our words we can bless others or with our words we can destroy others because death and life are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21).

Isaiah 56:3-7
In the old Covenant, foreigners and eunuchs were not allowed to enter the sacred areas of the Temple. Only Levites and the Aaronic priests could enter.
In the new Covenant, the priestly duties will be carried out by foreigners (non-Jews) who will be eunuchs (celebant).

This prophecy has been fulfilled in the Church where almost all priests are of non-Jewish blood and majority of them remain celebant by choice for the sake of the kingdom of Heaven (Matthew 19:12).

As Isaiah foretold, during worship we come to the Lord‚Äôs holy mountain, the heavenly Jerusalem, to offer the prescribed sacrifice, acceptable to God, at His Altar (Hebrews 12:22‚Äì24, 28).

##### Day #218 True fasting

Sometimes when we fast we may have the wrong intentions like ‚Äúlosing weight for lent‚Äù or ‚Äújust to tell everyone we are fasting‚Äù. We may sometimes fast for an intention and are laser-focused on the intention ‚Äì although this is not entirely wrong, the most important thing about fasting is to change our souls. If fasting causes you to get nasty and act badly towards others, then the fasting is not serving its purpose. We can be overly focused on the bodily aspects of fasting instead of the spiritual.
‚ÄúWhy do we fast, but you do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?‚Äù Look, you serve your own interest on your fast day, and oppress all your workers. 4 Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on high. 5 Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord? Is 58:3-5
True fasting should make us better people, we should do good things when we fast. Not just be hungry and angry. We should do charity and good works when we fast. That is why the Church recommends prayer, fasting, and almsgiving as a combined formula for lent. When we fast from food we should also fast from evil ‚Äì no pointing fingers or speaking evil. We should feed the hungry and satisfy the needs of the poor.
If you remove the yoke from among you, the pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil, 10 if you offer your food to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light shall rise in the darkness and your gloom be like the noonday. 11 The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your needs in parched places, and make your bones strong; and you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters never fail. 12 Your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to live in. Is 58
When we do the right fasting with prayer and almsgiving, God will bless our fast and we will be satisfied, our needs will be met, we will grow strong, and we will be built up. We will be like a watered garden whose water never fails. Our light shall break forth like the dawn.
Let us fast, pray and love - with a genuine heart. Rend our hearts and not our garments. Jesus reminded us to look good when we fast and not let anyone know, but God who sees our hearts will bless us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 218 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 58:1-10
The people fasted from food and water, covered themselves with ashes and sackcloth, and followed all the rituals required for fasting but they didn‚Äôt change their hearts/conscience. They continued oppressing their poor workers, quarrelling with each other and doing many things which were not pleasing to the Lord.
The people gave only lip service to God while their hearts were far from God.

We cannot fulfil our obligations only by following religious rituals.
God is deeply moved when the poor and needy ones cry out to Him for help and God is deeply hurt when we don't give true love to all the people in our lives.
God desires to share His love with all humanity and to help the less fortunate ones, but He needs the bodies of His baptized children to do all that. And before we begin helping others, God wants us to change our hearts so that we do everything with love and not as an obligation.

The old Covenant people were clearly told once, and reminded several times, that God desires mercy towards the less fortunate ones (Deut. 15:11; Hosea 6:6) and Jesus also emphasized on the importance of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).

God doesn‚Äôt want our worship to be just an item ticked off on our checklist. Therefore, fasting, praying, reading the Bible, attending daily/weekly Masses, etc. are of no use if we don‚Äôt have true love in our hearts for all the people in our lives and compassion for the poor and needy ones.

Ezekiel 18:4 & 20
God was speaking of spiritual death (Hell) (Ezekiel 18:4) because all humans are anyway subject to physical death.

No one is culpable for another person‚Äôs sins but when we commit mortal sins and we are comfortable living with them then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil‚Äôs aim is to destroy families because our earthly families were designed by God to be a symbol of the heavenly family. Therefore, if we have committed a mortal sin then we must confess our sin immediately, without delay, and ensure that we live in obedience to God and keep our souls purified at all times.

If we are leading holy lives and suffering because of the sins of others, it is because we are members of the human family and our sins affect one another in various ways. And God allows this to happen to us so that His grace can flow through us when we pray for our offenders while we are also spiritually healed.

Ezekiel 18:21-28
For a Christian, God's condition for judgement may seem fair, and so it is, but for the ancient Israelites it was an unfair judgment.

The ancient Israelites believed that they would receive eternal life if they lived righteous lives for a longer time, even if they ended up dying in sin, and not according the state of their souls when they died. So, according to them, receiving or losing eternal life depended upon which kind of life they lived on earth for a longer time, that is, righteous or unrighteous.
Therefore, the people were complaining because they found God‚Äôs judgement to be unfair.

Let us check if we also believe what those ancient Israelites believed or whether we accept God's judgement as fair and just.

##### Day #219 Growing little by little makes one stronger

Many people dream to win the lottery, especially those who have a lot of debts. We see poor people spending their money on lottery tickets. Most people will never win big prizes and those who actually win the jackpot will not know how to handle the big money.
Research shows that Lottery winners are more likely to declare bankruptcy within three to five years than the average American. What‚Äôs more, studies have shown that winning the lottery does not necessarily make you happier or healthier.
This proverb sheds wisdom on this aspect of our lives.
Wealth hastily gotten will dwindle, but those who gather little by little will increase it. Prov 13:11
Winning a lot of money won't make us rich, money will usually will dwindle pretty soon. For people are not prepared for it and they don‚Äôt know what to do with the money. Of course, there could be expectations that people have managed their finances well after winning a lottery.
On the other hand, one who slowly accumulates their wealth will know the value of money and will spend it wisely. That is why rich parents are advised to give little money to their kids else they will be spoiled.
The struggle that we face to climb the ladder of progress is good for us, it will teach us to be humble and wise in our spending. A lot of money will never make anyone happy, they may be happy for a little bit but will soon get bored. True happiness is in the process of struggling and growing.
It‚Äôs the same with our faith life, we cannot suddenly expect to grow and be given all the gifts. We will not know how to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit, that is why we need to slowly discover them. We need to struggle and journey so that we know the value of our spiritual gifts and our faith life. We need to walk daily with the Lord, we need to learn how to deny ourselves and slowly grow. If we fall we should get up and try again, never get disappointed but ‚Äúkeep On keeping ON‚Äù. May we receive the strength to follow the Lord closely, every day.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Isaiah 59:1-2
*The Lord‚Äôs hand is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. Rather, your iniquities have been barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.*

When we confess our sins to the priest and our sins are forgiven, the barrier between God and us is removed and we are reconciled with God.

Therefore, if our prayers have not been answered for a long time, we need to examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to God, or not. If not, then we need to repent and correct our errors.

##### Day #220 The oil of gladness instead of mourning

At the start of Jesus' public ministry, he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; 2 to proclaim the year of the Lord‚Äôs favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; 3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion‚Äî to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. Is 61:1-3
Jesus read from Isaiah, and when he finished reading it.
‚ÄúAnd he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù Luke 4: 20,21
We have such a blessing in Jesus, God with us ‚Äì Emmanuel. Jesus came to bring good news to us the oppressed, He came to bind up the brokenhearted ‚Äì God is close to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34). Jesus came to set up free from sin and death, we were captives to sin we were prisoners to death ‚Äì there is no salvation for us without Jesus as we are sinful people. Jesus came to proclaim the year of favor ‚Äì instead of God‚Äôs vengeance Jesus brought us comfort. God does not deal with us according to our sins, He gives us a garland instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.
We are called to be a people of Praise and celebration. We should be rejoicing because of what Jesus has done for us. By His death and resurrection Jesus cloths us with righteousness and with garments of salvation.
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. Is 61:10
Jesus clothes us in garments of holiness, by the blood of His sacrifice. We are called to the wedding banquet of the Eucharist where the Bridegroom - Jesus rejoices over His bride the Church.
For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. Is 62:5
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 220 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 62:1-5
The bride will have a name change after marriage.
Most communities follow this tradition after marriage. But this is only a reflection of our spiritual marriage to Jesus during Mass in the new Covenant.
After her marriage with God, the new name of Jerusalem (the bride/the Church) will be "married/Mrs." ("Beulah" in Hebrew). She will no longer be called abandoned / forsaken ("Azubah" in Hebrew) or barren / desolate ("Shemamah" in Hebrew) because after her marriage with God (the Son) during Mass she will have a spouse (Jesus) and she will go forth and evangelize to increase and multiply and fill the Church with souls.

Therefore, whenever we go to Church to attend Mass/the marriage feast of the Lamb, we must always dress modestly, as is also required of a bride, because we, the brides of Christ, are going to Church to marry the Holy King.

##### Day #221 There is none to stand in the breach before God

We read about this pitiful condition of the Israelites in exile. The prophets who are supposed to be God‚Äôs mouthpiece are speaking as they like, they are giving out messages that they did not receive, they speak of false visions. The people in the land are practicing extortion and committing robbery, the poor are oppressed and the needy neglected.
Its prophets have smeared whitewash on their behalf, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‚ÄúThus says the Lord God,‚Äù when the Lord has not spoken. 29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the alien without redress. 30 And I sought for anyone among them who would repair the wall and stand in the breach before me on behalf of the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. 31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; I have returned their conduct upon their heads, says the Lord God. Eze 22: 28-31
There is no one to stand in the breach and intercede for these people. No one, not even one is found to pray for the nation.
This seems the case with the world even today, sin, violence and Godlessness are very common, and people are losing their faith. We need leaders to speak the truth to the people, not just being poetically correct but being a mouthpiece of the Lord. We need "prayer warriors" to stand in the gap between mankind and God and pray for this world. Just like Abraham prayed for the city of Sodom, we should plead to the Lord for our cities even to the very last person ‚Äì even if there is one righteous person the Lord will save the whole city.
We are not alone in the breech; Jesus is with us carrying one side of the yoke. Jesus is the great interceder who not only prays for the people but also sacrificed himself for our sins.
33 Who will bring any charge against God‚Äôs elect? It is God who justifies. 34 Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us Rom 8:33,34
Jesus is at the right hand of the Father, praying for us and interceding for us, we just need to partner with Jesus in prayer, praying for the world to change.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #222 Indifferent toward God

The prophet Ezekiel is called to act out the prophecy in a very real way, he is also called the performance arts prophet. Because he not only prophecies with his words He also acts out/performs actions so that the Israelites will vividly remember the prophesies when it comes to pass.
The Lord will take away the prophet Ezekiel‚Äôs wife, the delight of his eye, the woman he truly loved. When someone loses their life partner, they would go into mourning and feel as though everything is lost, especially if the death is sudden. Everyone knew that Ezekiel loved his wife and just could not understand why he was not mourning for her. He was enacting what the Lord asked him to do, this was just a foreshadowing of what the Israelites would do when the temple would be destroyed. The temple was the pride of Israel, the delight of their eye.
15 The word of the Lord came to me: 16 Mortal, with one blow I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down. 17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded.
19 Then the people said to me, ‚ÄúWill you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting this way?‚Äù 20 Then I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me: 21 Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and your heart‚Äôs desire; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword. 22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your upper lip or eat the bread of mourners.23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another. 24 Thus Ezekiel shall be a sign to you; you shall do just as he has done. When this comes, then you shall know that I am the Lord God. Eze 24:15-24
This indifference towards God can be seen even today in our generation. We do not seem to be moved when we see people doing evil things. Even if God and Holy things are desecrated, we tend to not even bother. When there is evil within the church we just want to brush it under the carpet and. When there are evil laws passed, we just ignore them. When our kids don‚Äôt go to church we don‚Äôt correct them. When people are living scandalous lives we are okay with it. We cannot be indifferent to the poor, the hungry, the evildoers. We need to take a stand for Christ in this ungodly world. We cannot be indifferent but have to be concerned and pray for this world. We cannot be lukewarm, since we are neither hot nor cold the Lord is about to spit us out of His mouth.
15 ‚ÄúI know your works; you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were either cold or hot. 16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth.Rev 3:15-16

##### Day #223 The New Covenant

Even though Israel was the chosen people of God the story does not end there. Everyone is a child of God whether Israelite or Pagan. God reveals this new covenant through the prophet Isaiah. God is making a new covenant with humanity, expanding "all flesh" to be part of his kingdom. A new heaven and a new earth God is making, Jesus will establish this kingdom and this kingdom will never end, and everyone is welcome. The priesthood is now opened up to everyone ‚Äì not just the tribe of levities.
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the Lord; so shall your descendants and your name remain. From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the Lord. Is 66: 22,23
This new kingdom will be a kingdom of abundance ‚Äì an abundance of Mercy, Love, and Peace. This kingdom will be a prosperous Kingdom, flowing like a river and wealth like an overflowing stream. God will comfort us with the new covenant ‚Äì just as a mother comforts her child.
For thus says the Lord: I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm, and dandled on her knees. 13 As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. Is 66:12,13
In this new covenant, we can find endless streams of God‚Äôs mercy flowing from Jesus‚Äôs side on the cross. We have access to the richest food, which is God Himself ‚Äì Jesus‚Äô Body and blood. The Holy Spirit has been poured out into our hearts, the living waters which never dry up.
Let us be thankful and rejoice that we are in the new covenant. Thank you, Jesus.

Isaiah 66:18-21
Jesus chose Paul to fulfill this prophecy. Paul went far and wide to the gentile nations around Israel to preach the Gospel to them and brought many of them into the Church. According to this prophecy, those were the descendants of the scattered tribes. Paul therefore chose to preach in the Synagogues where he could find the Jews as well as the gentiles who were the mixed descendants of the scattered tribes.

Paul later ordained many of them to serve as priests and deacons/Levites in the Church (Acts 20:28).

##### Day #224 Jeremiah‚Äôs call is our call

Just reading Jeremiah‚Äôs call gives me goosebumps. Our dear ‚ÄúAbba‚Äù - Father God knew us before we were born, He formed us in our mother's womb and appointed us to be a prophet to the nations.
Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
5 ‚ÄúBefore I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.‚Äù
6 Then I said, ‚ÄúAh, Lord God! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.‚Äù 7 But the Lord said to me,
‚ÄúDo not say, ‚ÄòI am only a boy‚Äô; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you. 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.‚Äù
9 Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me,
‚ÄúNow I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.‚Äù Jer 1:4-10
We are all called to evangelize, to let our light shine before all. There is no exception to this calling, every Christian is called to bear Christ ‚Äì that is why we are called Christians (Christian means Christ-bearer). We are supposed to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
It can seem frightening to Evangelize as we may not feel prepared to do so.
Jeremiah was but a boy and the Lord knew that Jeremiah would not feel ready to be a prophet, to speak God‚Äôs word. That is why in the call itself God told him not to fear or feel inferior to anyone. God reminds us as we read this, that we should not fear anything or anyone ‚Äì but rely on God fully. We should only speak what the Lord is guiding us to speak.
Just as the Lord touched the tongue of Jeremiah and anointed and appointed him to be a prophet to the nations. Jesus touches our tongues every time we receive Communion. At the end of Mass, we are commissioned by the priest (Jesus in the person of the priest) to go out and announce the Good news of the Lord. We can go out boldly knowing that God is with us, wherever we go and He will confirm the Good news we announce with signs and wonders. Let us not fear, but step out in faith, for the God who formed us in our mother‚Äôs womb is with us, till the end of times.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 224 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 1:4-10
The conversations between God and the prophets are recorded to prove that the prophets were called by God.

Jeremiah 1:5
\*Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.‚Äù\*

Before Jeremiah was even conceived in the womb, God had already started preparing Jeremiah for his involvement in God‚Äôs divine plan.

Before a child is even conceived in the womb, God already has a mission ready for the child. Abortion and use of birth control techniques are all diabolic because they are Satan‚Äôs ways of making sure that God does not fulfill His divine plan for the world. Therefore, being an obstacle in God‚Äôs divine plan is a mortal sin. Through these ungodly acts we may have destroyed God‚Äôs chosen prophets, priests, scientists, rulers, etc. who would have made a positive difference to the world. We also reduce considerably the number of souls going to Heaven, and we are therefore responsible for the misery and chaos in our homes and in the world which Satan happily gives us in return for obeying him.

It is for God to decide how many children a womb must bring forth. It is not for us to decide. As parents we must ensure that all our children receive spiritual nourishment so that all souls receive eternal life.

Jeremiah 1:6-8
In the Jewish community, a male child was a boy till his beard began to grow or until he was 21 years of age. This means God called Jeremiah very early in his life.

There is no age limit for doing God‚Äôs work. God can call us anytime of our life to be a part of His divine plan. Abraham was called when he was 75, Moses was called when he was 80, Jeremiah was called when he was less than 21 years of age.
When God calls us for His divine mission we must be ready and willing.

##### Day #225 Cracked cisterns instead of fountains of living water

Prophet Jeremiah speaks this message of the people's betrayal; the Israelites have forsaken the Lord.
The Lord is shocked, that his own people ‚Äì the ones he brought out of slavery into the promised land, have abandoned Him. The Israelites have committed two evils, they have forsaken the fountains of living waters and have created cracked cisterns that don‚Äôt even hold water.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord, 13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 2 Jer 12,13
We have in some way or the other forsaken God and got attached to things of this world instead. We have abandoned the love, joy, and peace that comes from a good relationship with the Lord to a self-seeking, self-centered view of things ‚Äì where we are more concerned about our status, health, looks, wealth, and comfort.
St Augustine in the first Chapter of ‚ÄúThe confessions‚Äù states that we will never rest until we rest in the Lord.
You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.
We have abandoned a 'life in the Spirit, the life where the Holy Spirit will become a spring of water gushing up to heaven. We are led by worldly thoughts and ideas. We are running after things that perish and rot. Instead of being led by the Spirit, we are being led by our desires and passions ‚Äì which are the cisterns that are cracked. We will never be satisfied no matter how much earthly success, wealth, beauty, lust, drunkenness, status, or comfort we may get.

Ezekiel 28:12-17
God told Ezekiel to speak to Satan who was behind the king‚Äôs evil deeds.

Unlike humans, angels have a superior intellect by which they can clearly see the consequences of their choices in advance and therefore there is no forgiveness for them when they disobey God. Inspite of that, Lucifer chose to be the topmost in an inferior order rather than becoming one among others in a superior order.
In other words, Lucifer chose to be king in Hell as opposed to being a servant in Heaven

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt push others under our feet to obtain a higher position, whatever field we are in.
As followers of Christ, let us always look for opportunities to serve others.

Ezekiel 28:16
*What was Lucifer‚Äôs iniquity?*

Lucifer was chased out of God‚Äôs family (Heaven) because he was too busy with things that were taking him away from God, and eventually, in his pride, he started claiming equality with God (v. 2). Therefore he lost the anointing. It is the same spirit which he puts in the minds of those who are hungry for power and success.

In the abundance of too many worldly activities, there is a possibility that we too may be filled with constant violence, anger and irritation. We may be having too many responsibilities, too many problems, too many things on our head, and then we sin. We may also be too busy focusing on our success in life.

If we lead a busy life, with so many worldly activities which are not connected to spiritual activities, then there is a possibility that we too will lose the presence of God within us, and we will be chased out of God‚Äôs family (Heaven) if we have not repented and confessed our sins before our death.

Angels don‚Äôt have the option to repent for their sins and therefore Lucifer and his minions will remain permanently out of Heaven. But we, humans, are so blessed that God, in His love for us, has given us, in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the option to repent and renew the Covenant, which we break with our sins. Therefore, let us not ignore or reject God‚Äôs mercy; let us ensure to repent and confess our sins and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly so that we can remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times.

##### DAY 225 By Sheila

JEREMIAH speaks of the intimacy of the Covenant Relationship between God and Israel denoting love, loyalty and a devotion like a young bride to the Lord. Israel was God's first fruit of the Nature.

According to the Old Testament, first fruit of the harvest belonged to God. The lsraelites had the full resources to God, the Living Water, yet took roads to broken cisterns or a black river. As Verse 37 "Your hands on your heads" Indicates, subject to foreign power.
EZEKIEL emphasized the gravity of sins of the King of Tyre. Verse 18 Fire represents God's Judgment.
PROVERBS speaks of the right way that leads to success and happiness and obedience to the Will of God. Sin is often able to hide its own character, an easy path that leads to an early death.

##### Day #226 True freedom is found in a Christ-centered life.

This proverb is so relevant to our times where everyone just wants the freedom to do as they please. We are a generation that doesn‚Äôt like restraints, borders, or limitations. We fight for rights and demand that everyone is given an opportunity to do as they please with their bodies/lives. We don‚Äôt like moderate living or many rules but are rebellious and careless.
The wise are cautious and turn away from evil, but the fool throws off restraint and is careless. Prov 14:16
Freedom seems to be misunderstood in our generation, freedom does not mean that we get to be God, we get to do what we want. Freedom means we choose what is good, and hold onto what is good.
Christ has set us free, by His life, death, and resurrection. A heavy price was paid for our freedom.
Our Salvation is free, not cheap,
Christ paid for our sins. We are called to Freedom and not to misuse our freedom.
13 For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another. 14 For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚ÄùRom 5:13,14
Our Freedom should lead us to a holy life, a Christ-Centered life, not a Live where we are free to do what we want. We will never be satisfied if we just do what we want, in fact, the one who throws away restraint is called a fool in the proverb. No one can ride a horse without a bit/bridle in its mouth or control a ship without a rudder and wheel. A life without restraint is like riding a wild horse.
Let us find true freedom in Christ, the freedom to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #227 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskin of your hearts.

Sometimes our faith life can get limited to the outward following of rituals instead of heart-filled worship. We can be going through the motions in our spiritual life and not even know it. We may be praying but our heart is far from the Lord. The Jewish people have lost the true essence of the covenant they had with the Lord. They needed a wake-up call, a great awakening. The Lord is trying to get His people back, prophet after prophet is calling out to the people to repent. Prophet Jeremiah has been preaching repentance for years now, he cries out.
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of your hearts Jer 4:4
It is very important to be cut to the heart, each time we repent. Just following the customs or babbling prayers may make us just like the Pharisees and teachers of the Law who stood on street corners and prayed lengthy prayers and made a big show of the charity they did.
We are called to make humble prayers, prayers of a child to the Father. For God will hear those prayers that come from the heart.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
When we make a confession, we are usually listing out all the sins that we committed. Along with confessing those sins, we should also take resolve, to avoid them in the future. The Change has to be in the heart, truly sincere and genuine. A contrite heart the Lord will not despise.
The heart is where all sin originates and then becomes actions. Jesus reminds us that outward customs of washing of hands is not as important as having a clean heart.
Then he said, ‚ÄúAre you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? 18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles. 19 For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. 20 These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.‚Äù Mat 15:16-19
So let us examine our hearts and circumcise ourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of the heart(Speaking metaphorically like the Scripture.). Let us rend our hearts and not our garments.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Jeremiah 3:1-2
According to the law, an unfaithful wife, who provoked a divorce from her husband and married another man, was not allowed to return to her first husband (Deut. 24:1-4).

Similarly, unfaithful Israel, who provoked the Lord to anger by defiling their sacred land with idolatry, would not be allowed to be part of God's family.

It is the same condition in the new Covenant also.

Unfaithful Christians, who provoke the Lord to anger by defiling themselves with idolatry (that is, putting their faith and trust in humans and earthly things), will not be allowed to be part of God's family.

Jeremiah 3:3
*Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come;*

God would stop the rain because the people worshipped the false fertility gods to receive abundant crop when it was God who gave them a fertile soil.

Jeremiah 3:19-20
Jeremiah blends fatherly love and marital love as a tangible expression of the Covenant relation.

##### Day #228 A Sentinel just cannot keep quiet when he sees the sword coming

This is such a beautiful read, a good reminder to speak up and warn this world. It is worth reading God‚Äôs word one more time. It‚Äôs explained in such clarity that we need not add much of an explanation.

The word of the LORD came to me: 2 O Mortal, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one of their number as their sentinel; 3 and if the sentinel sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people; 4 then if any who hear the sound of the trumpet do not take warning, and the sword comes and takes them away, their blood shall be upon their own heads. 5 They heard the sound of the trumpet and did not take warning; their blood shall be upon themselves. But if they had taken warning, they would have saved their lives. 6 But if the sentinel sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any of them, they are taken away in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at the sentinel‚Äôs hand.
7 So you, mortal, I have made a sentinel for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 8 If I say to the wicked, ‚ÄúO wicked ones, you shall surely die,‚Äù and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but their blood I will require at your hand. 9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from their ways, and they do not turn from their ways, the wicked shall die in their iniquity, but you will have saved your life. Ezekiel 33:1-9
We can sometimes try to be politically correct or avoid confrontation. But we are the Sentinel who needs to blow the trumpet, if we don‚Äôt speak up the blood of the innocent will be on our hands. For Example: If we do not take a stand for abortion rights, we will be accountable for the innocent babies. If we fail to correct our children who want to cohabitate before marriage, we are liable for their sins. If we allow evil to enter this society without any pushback we will be held responsible for future generations.
We not only need to speak up but have to live a just life. We cannot be a hypocrite, speak against sin and commit it ourselves. If we live bad lives and call ourselves Christians, we are actually leading others to sin ‚Äì it‚Äôs the sin of scandal.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines scandal as ‚Äúan attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor‚Äôs tempter. He damages virtue and integrity; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death.‚Äù Our Lord militates against scandal, and even ties a curse to those who promote it: ‚ÄúWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea‚Äù (Matt 18:6).

Let us be a good Sentinel/Watchman and warn this generation of the evil we are committing. It does not matter if they listen or not, we just need to speak the truth in love.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Shepherds of Israel

[![Shepherds of Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day229.jpg)](https://youtu.be/aPLc49xQNBE "Shepherds of Israel")

##### Day #229 The Lord will be our Shepherd

As we read through the OT we see that the Spiritual leaders were not really doing what they were called to. They are not taking good care of those entrusted to their care.
The word of the Lord came to me: 2 ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? 3 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. 4 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. 5 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. 6 My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. Eze 34:1-6
Sometimes parishes can face this problem when the pastor does not be a shepherd to the flock. This could be the case when a Parent does not care for the children. This could be the case when a teacher does not really take care of her class. Everyone is called to serve in some capacity or the other and when we fail to live up to our calling, we end up like the shepherds of Israel. Failing in our responsibility is actually okay as long as we want to do better and try to improve. As long as we are not like the shepherds of Israel who only took care of themselves, who ate and cloth themselves well and ignored the people under their care. Who did not bind up the wounds properly.
They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, ‚ÄúPeace, peace,‚Äù when there is no peace. Jer 6:14
Let us not tell people that all is good when things are not good, we should be genuine in our message and care for others. The shepherds of Israel would give false hope to the people telling them that everything is fine when it actually was not. They would say Peace when there was no peace.
Let the bad example of the shepherds of Israel lead us to become good shepherds. Good shepherds after the heart of Jesus ‚ÄúThe Good Shepherd‚Äù.
Jesus the Good shepherd fulfilled this promise that God made us through the prophet Ezekiel.
11 ‚Äú‚ÄòFor this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. 12 As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. 13 I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. 14 I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 15 I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord. 16 I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. Eze 33: 11-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 229 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 6:17
*I raised up sentinels for you, ‚ÄúGive heed to the sound of the trumpet!‚Äù*

Sentinels are watchmen who must remain awake and alert, without a break, while on duty. They are put in charge of the four towers above the city gate to watch for any possible enemies and alert the king and his people of any possible danger.
A prophet functions in a similar manner. His duty is to protect God's people from the spiritual enemy (Satan).

Ezekiel 34:11-12
*For thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep have been scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.*

There were many false shepherds in ancient Israel who led God‚Äôs people astray. During the time of Jesus the false shepherds were king Herod (he was not from the Davidic family) and the High Priests Annas and Caiaphas (they were not from the Aaronic family). Whichever families they came from, in their role as king and priests their duty was to lead the people to God but they became rich by abusing the people, they led ungodly lives themselves and led the people away from God.

God promised that He would rescue His lost sheep on the day of the crucifixion of Jesus, in the presence of Jews from all over the world, when there would be clouds and thick darkness due to an eclipse (Matthew 27:45).

As commanded by God, through Moses, all Jewish men had to celebrate Passover and Pentecost once a year ‚Äúonly in Jerusalem.‚Äù This was planned by God so that every Jewish man would be present on Passover day when Jesus would die on the Cross to save them and the rest of the world. They later gathered again in Jerusalem on Pentecost Sunday, 50 days after the Resurrection of Jesus, and 3,000 Jews, from all over the world, were baptized that day and thus they were rescued (Acts 2:7-11 & 37-41).

##### Day #230 I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

The Love of the Lord is so great that even though the people of Israel left for idols and fake gods, God never forgot them. God promises to deliver Israel from exile and bring them back to their own land.
‚Äú‚ÄòFor I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 28 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. Eze 36:24-29
There is something more than being brought back to the own land. We all can relate to the warm feeling we get when we get back home. Home is a known safe place where we find comfort and rest. Just as the Israelites we can be living in exile ‚Äì spiritually.
Even though we live in a country that allows us to practice our religion, our hearts may be far from home. Our spiritual home is in God and we find rest, comfort, and peace only in His arms. We may have been living in an exile state of mind, when we sin we move away from God and our hearts become harder, if we continually sin our hearts become like stone. God wants to restore our stony hearts today, we are invited to go back to Him.
He will take away our hearts of stone and give us a heart of flesh, a heart that loves God and neighbor. We may be led by our own spirit or worldly spirits ‚Äì God will fill us with the Holy Spirit that will lead us to all truth. We will be washed by the blood of the lamb, made holy and pure. The new Spirit that we receive will help us to follow God‚Äôs ways, the Holy Spirit our helper will empower us to live holy lives.
Let us return to the Lord, trade our hearts of stone for a heart of flesh, and be filled by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Jeremiah 7:13-14
*And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.*

Even if we have been spending long hours in praise and worship and prayer, we can still be spiritually indifferent if our hearts are not with the Lord.

Jeremiah 7:16
*As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry or prayer on their behalf, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.*

Constantly interceding for the people was one of the important duties of a prophet.

Jeremiah 7:18
*Queen of Heaven.*

This was the goddess Ishtar who was believed by the people to be a goddess of fertility, love and war.

Jeremiah 7:22-23
*For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them, ‚ÄúObey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you.‚Äù*

Our sacrifices and offerings have no value when we live in disobedience to God.
Although this command was given to the Israelites during the time of Moses (Exodus 19:5), the same command is applicable to us too.

Ezekiel 36:23-24
*I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes. I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.*

In the old Covenant, Israel was supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world but, instead, they allowed the darkness of idolatry to seep into their own lifestyle. Therefore, they were being prepared for exile. But exile was not meant for God to get His back at the people. Exile was how God got His people back to Him.

In the new Covenant, Christians are supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world (Matthew 5:16). So let us not make the same mistake by allowing the darkness of idolatry (wealth, power, comfort and pleasures of this world) to seep into our lifestyles. Let us focus more on God, and not on accumulating wealth and possessions, or else we too may have to face a similar exile (physical or spiritual or maybe both).

Ezekiel 36:25-28
*I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

In the old Covenant, ritual washing with water was only a symbol of baptism. The water just cleaned their bodies externally. It never cleansed anyone of their sins.
Ezekiel was prophesying about baptism in the new Covenant. God promised to give us His divine Spirit through our baptism, which was inaugurated when the Holy Spirit anointed Jesus during His baptism.

In the new Covenant, baptism is not an upgraded ritual of the past. Baptism gives us the Spirit of God, that is, divine life, thus making us members of God's family, but the actual grace of baptism comes to us from Jesus through the baptized humans who baptize us, as it does with all the other sacraments as well.

The Holy Spirit was released to the world only once, on Pentecost Sunday, and it is the same Spirit which is given to each one of us individually through the sacraments.

Jeremiah 8:18-22
Gilead was known for its world famous herbal treatments.
God had been silent when the people were suffering and it didn't look like any help was going to come from Heaven. The only option left was for the prophet to weep continuously for his people because although they were suffering due to the calamity he was more hurt because of their spiritual blindness (v. 19-20). They ignored or took for granted all the blessings and miracles which God had done in their lives.
Jeremiah cried for his people just as Jesus cried for His people because His people refused to follow Him (Luke 19:41).

Ezekiel 37:1-6
The dry bones will be the in-gathering of the Jews without the Holy Spirit because of their unbelief. The Holy Spirit will breathe divine life into them only when they will believe in Christ and accept to be baptized.

##### Day#231 By Michael Eltham

The Valley of dry bones ‚Äì hope in the Lord
The best way to read this is to place yourself in the field of dry bones. Let us try to prayerfully read this scripture ‚Äì try to imagine that you are present in the valley.
The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, ‚ÄúSon of man, can these bones live?‚Äù
I said, ‚ÄúSovereign Lord, you alone know.‚Äù
4 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to these bones and say to them, ‚ÄòDry bones, hear the word of the Lord! 5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
9 Then he said to me, ‚ÄúProphesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.‚Äô‚Äù 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet‚Äîa vast army.Eze 37:1-10
This vision of Ezekiel would have been so hard to preach because Israel was in a state of despair, they had no hope. They were in exile in a place of no return. They would have found the prophecy to hard to believe.
We could sometimes be in a situation where there seems to be no hope, death is all around us and we feel that there is no redemption, there is no return. This could be the state of someone we love, a spouse/parent/child/friend ‚Äì we know for a fact that this person will never change or will never accept Christ ‚Äì before we rule it out, let us remember that our God can do anything. Let us not lose faith, but pray unceasingly for these dead situations.
The Lord that created this world from nothing, can bring life back to things that seem dead. It may take a process, but we need to walk with the Lord and follow His instructions ‚Äì like Ezekiel we may have to prophesy a few times until the bones become fully alive. The God who put breath in Adam is able to also put breath back in dead bones. He is able to bring the dead(Lazarus) to life again.
Then he said to me: ‚ÄúSon of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‚ÄòOur bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.‚Äô 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.‚Äô‚ÄùEze 36:11-14
The meaning of the prophecy is clear, God will bring back life to Israel and put His breath in them again, they will come back to the promised land and He will be their God and they shall be His people.
It is so with us as well, if you find yourself in a place of no hope, due to sin or sickness just return to the Lord who is able to restore you to life. He will put His breath in you and He will be your God and you shall be his child.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Why must judgement fall on God's people?
Because of their defiant attitude towards God, rejection of God's Law, preference for false gods and refusal to repent.

Let us check if we are any different from those people.

*If you listen to my voice, and do all that I command you, then you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

Let us not boast in our wisdom, might or wealth but in the knowledge of Christ.
There are many wise, wealthy, and mighty people in this world. Many people are in a rat race to become wise, wealthy, and mighty and spend their entire lives perusing these things. Wisdom, wealth, and Might are good things and we should peruse them and be prosperous. There is nothing wrong is learning, accumulating wealth and building your strength. But we should not boast in them, we should only use them as created things and always treat them as dirt in comparison to our faith life.
23 Thus says the Lord: Do not let the wise boast in their wisdom, do not let the mighty boast in their might, do not let the wealthy boast in their wealth; 24 but let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.
Let us never boast in our accomplishments but rather boast in our relationship with the Lord. Let us remember that all good comes from the Lord and that we and our attributes are nothing but a gift from the Lord. All human wisdom is nothing but foolishness to God.
18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become ‚Äúfools‚Äù so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God‚Äôs sight. As it is written: ‚ÄúHe catches the wise in their craftiness‚Äù; 20 and again, ‚ÄúThe Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.‚Äù21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! 1 Cor 3:18-21
We should not boast in our wisdom as the wisdom of the world is foolishness in God's sight. We should boast in the knowledge of the Lord, for knowing God is the greatest thing that can ever happen to us, and having a relationship with God is the greatest achievement that one can have. St Paul was a learned Jew who was persecuting the Christians and finally converted, his letters are so filled with wisdom and he achieved many things in his life.
7 Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. 10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, 11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
We like St Paul should consider everything as rubbish in comparison to the value of knowing Christ. Our wisdom, might, and wealth are all utter rubbish compared to our dear Lord Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Correct me, O Lord

Day 233: Correct me, O Lord ‚Äî The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)

Fr. Mike reflects on Jeremiah‚Äôs sorrow for the people of Israel while reminding us that the one thing we ought to find glory in, is in understanding and knowing God. In our reading of Ezekiel, we hear about God's ongoing promise to restore Israel. Today‚Äôs readings are Jeremiah 9, Ezekiel 39, and Proverbs 15:1-4.

##### Day #233 By Michael Eltham

Making God in our own image and likeness.

As we read through the Old Testament, we see that idolatry comes up a lot. We read the description of how a tree is cut down, and an artisan carves out idols according to his own imagination. How the metal workers put metal on it, and how the people deck it with gold and silver. The idol is installed in a field or in a temple and people worship it. Although the idol cannot talk or act, cannot move or do good or bad, people worship it as they want. They did whatever shameful acts that they wanted in front of the idols and called it a sacrifice to the god. Do not learn the way of the nations, or be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.

3 For the customs of the peoples are false: a tree from the forest is cut down, and worked with an ax by the hands of an artisan; 4 people deck it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move. 5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good. Jer 10:2-5

Now I‚Äôm sure none of us would do such a thing as worship an idol, then how do we apply this in our day and age?

We can be that crafty artisan who makes God according to his own imagination, we could take the real God Jesus Christ and put Him in a box. We can believe things like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay to sin God will forgive me anyways‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll God‚Äôs are equal and every religion is correct‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Jesus is present in the Eucharist ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a ritual‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to confess my sins to a priest‚Äù or ‚ÄúThere is no need for community pray ‚Äì I will just pray in my room‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine to live with my partner before marriage if my intention is to marry‚Äù.

We can try to interpret scripture to suit our own needs ‚Äì for example ‚Äì ‚ÄúJesus changes gallons of water into wine, that means I should drink a lot‚Äù or ‚ÄúScripture says Keep holy the sabbath ‚Äì so I can freely sin on other days.‚Äù

I think that the new idolatry that we will encounter a lot is not worshiping an idol but making the true God Jesus Christ in our own image and likeness. We make an idol of the true God and think that our imagination is the truth. We are crafty in many ways to twist things and make them fit according to what we like.

Let us seek the Lord in all truth and let Him be Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![Jeremiah Complains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day234.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vUnrOcUy81s "Jeremiah Complains")

Fr. Mike teaches us about recognizing our limitations especially when trying to compete with God. We also see how the Lord listens to Jeremiah‚Äôs complaints and responds to him in a peculiar but hopeful way. Today‚Äôs readings are Jeremiah 12-13, Ezekiel 41-42, and Proverbs 15:9-12.

##### Day #234 By Michael Eltham

A scoffer does not like to be reproved

Now people can be broadly categorized into two types, those who will listen and those who just won‚Äôt. Some people can float in between the two states. The type A group who just does not listen to advice and does not want guidance ‚Äì the Bible calls them fools/foolish. Those who listen and take advice, those who seek the Lord and His teachings will be saved, the kind who are led by the Spirit.

‚ÄúScoffers do not like to be rebuked; they will not go to the wise.‚Äù Proverbs 15:12

The path of listening to the Spirit will bring a lot of discipline, we will need to avoid the ways of the world. It will take a lot of attentiveness to the Lord, a lot of active listening and learning, and praying. It‚Äôs a journey of a lifetime, where we read God‚Äôs word and apply it, if we fail we will try again and again, and the Lord will bless our effort. He will empower us and strengthen us to do His will.

But the path of the wicked will not prosper, those who do not want to listen will perish. We have many people who think thoughts like ‚ÄúIf I just do enough of charity, I can get away with living a sinful life‚Äù.

The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, but he loves the one who pursues righteousness. ‚ÄúThere is severe discipline for one who forsakes the way, but one who hates a rebuke will die.‚Äù Prov 15:9,10

Sometimes it can be frustrating when we try to correct people or teach them the right way and they just do not listen. Like Jeremiah, we may want to complain to the Lord.

Why does the way of the guilty prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive? ‚ÄúYou plant them, and they take root; they grow and bring forth fruit; you are near in their mouths yet far from their hearts.‚Äù Jer 12:2-3

It is okay to bring our complaints to the Lord, God knows our hearts and will understand our frustration. Just get your thoughts captive and have a conversation with the Lord. Sometimes those who won‚Äôt listen need to be taught the hard way, that is when problems creep into their lives and it makes them humble and docile.

Let us pray that we can be open to the Lord and others, especially those in authority in our lives like our parents, pastor, teachers, and leaders.

May we have hearts that are teachable and may we be good learners.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Jeremiah 15:10
*I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.*

In ancient Israel most of the fights took place because of borrowing and lending, and resulted in people cursing each other. But Jeremiah was distressed because he was being cursed even without getting involved in borrowing or lending.
Yet he did not retaliate. He followed the Word of God and sought God‚Äôs help.
God wanted him to suffer for the salvation of others.

Sometimes God may allow similar things to happen to us too. We may wonder why we are victims of cruelty or evil or injustice, etc. when we have neither done anything wrong nor interfered with anyone‚Äôs life.

In a Covenant relation, it is always the innocent who suffer for the sins of the guilty because God‚Äôs justice for the unrighteous is satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous. That is why God accepts the Blood of Jesus offered in atonement for our sins.

Therefore, if we are in a similar situation as Jeremiah then we must suffer with patience and offer our sufferings to Christ as penance for the sins of our offenders (Colossians 1:24), while we also pray for them.

Ezekiel 44:2-3
*The LORD said to me, ‚ÄúThis gate must remain shut; it must not be opened, and no one should come through it. Because the LORD, the God of Israel, came through it, it must remain shut.‚Äù*

When the presence of the Lord passed through the gate of the temple, that gate had to be shut and no one could ever enter or exit it again.
This was a symbol of the perpetual virginity of Mary.

It was God‚Äôs Will that Mary‚Äôs womb should be a perpetual virgin womb, a unique vessel specially reserved only for His Son, because the Lord had passed through it. But Mary remained a perpetual virgin, not because she was forced by anyone but because God gave her the grace to accept His Will, and she always co-operated with God‚Äôs grace by putting God‚Äôs Will first in her life.

Joseph also, being a righteous man himself (Matthew 1:19), always co-operated with God‚Äôs grace by putting God‚Äôs Will first in his life. And Joseph led a virginal life knowing that Mary was chosen by God to be the spouse of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35).

In the early Church, this type of marriage was known as ‚ÄúJosephite marriage.‚Äù

God gives each one of us too the grace to accept His Will but it always depends on whose will is our priority, God‚Äôs Will or our will.

*Only the prince may sit in it to eat a meal in the presence of the LORD; he must enter through the vestibule of the gate and leave the same way.*

The prince was a type of Christ. Christ alone passed through the womb of Mary.

Jeremiah 16:16
*Fishers and hunters.*

In the future God would send fishers to find the Israelites because they would be scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing. The gentiles/lost tribes, who would be living in the woodlands, would have to be found by hunters.

Jeremiah 17:5-10
Trees that grow beside water banks are not affected by heat or drought because their roots are always close to water. They don't even depend on humans to provide them with water.

Like those trees, if we are deeply rooted in Christ, the living water, then we will never be disturbed with whatever crisis the devil throws in our lap (whether it is family problem, job problem, financial problem, health problem, political problem or any other problem) because God will always be with us.
Jesus comes to us through the sacraments, and stays with us to help us walk through the storms.

##### Day #236 By Michael Eltham

Our hearts are deceitful above all things

We know our hearts and are fully aware of the type of person we are. We can put on a mask for the world to see and hide stuff from our family but not from God. For God searches the minds and tries the hearts. Our God is our maker and is fully aware of us ‚Äì through and through.

The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately corrupt; who can understand it? ‚ÄúI the Lord search the mind and try the heart, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.‚Äù Jer 17:9-10

Our hearts are corrupt, and we make it hard every time we sin. We keep fighting our conscience, and our minds become dull to do the right thing. From the heart come all sorts of evil, which are translated into actions.
From within, from the human heart, evil intentions come fornication, theft, murder, 22 adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, and folly. 23 All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.‚Äù Mark 7:21-23

As Jesus taught, all evil starts in the hearts and then becomes thoughts and actions. Let us do some self-evaluation of our hearts and prayerfully discern to see if our hearts have any of those evils mentioned above.

As we pray and discover the evil within us, we cannot help but cry out for healing. Let us join Jeremiah in this earnest prayer.
Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; Jer 17:14

It‚Äôs a good practice to pray this prayer several times a day and ask God for healing of hearts.

Another prayer that can help in healing the heart is the ‚ÄúJesus prayer‚Äù ‚Äì The Easter Christians have used this prayer to great advantage ‚Äì praying this simple yet effective prayer repeatably

"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." Some practice praying this with every breath, and many saints have prayed this prayer until their last breath. Joan of Arc died with the one word Jesus on her lips.

Let us practice praying this many times a day, this prayer will bring healing to our deceitful hearts.

"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Water from the Temple

[![Water from the Temple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day237.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ItGIk1bAC6U "Water from the Temple")

Fr. Mike guides us through the last two chapters of Ezekiel, explaining the biblical significance of the water flowing from the right side of the temple, and how it foreshadows Christ's passion. He also emphasizes the imagery of the clay and the potter in Jeremiah, signifying how our lives are meant to be open for God to mold and shape, according to his will. Today's readings are Jeremiah 18-19, Ezekiel 47-48, and Proverbs 15:21-24.

##### Day #237 By Michael Eltham

The Potter and the clay

The best way to understand this reading is to imagine walking with Jeremiah to the potter‚Äôs house. The clay cannot make itself, it cannot even decide what shape it wants to be. Left on its own the clay will just stay spinning, however when the potter starts shaping the clay that is when it becomes a masterpiece of the potter. The potter would make it for whatever purpose he desired.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 2 ‚ÄúArise, and go down to the potter‚Äôs house, and there I will let you hear my words.‚Äù 3 So I went down to the potter‚Äôs house, and there he was working at his wheel. 4 And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter‚Äôs hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. 5 Then the word of the Lord came to me: 6 ‚ÄúO house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? says the Lord. Behold, like the clay in the potter‚Äôs hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. 7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, 8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it. Jer 18:1-8

Just as the potter of the clay can make the clay into the shape that he desires, God is in control of our lives and shapes us. It does not matter how much of a mess we are in, the Potter can make it beautiful. If the vessel that the potter was making was spoiled in the potter‚Äôs hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. In the same way, if we have ruined the opportunities that the Lord gave us, we can always trust the Lord to rebuild us and rework us to do something new and make us a valuable vessel for His service. The important thing is to remain in the hands of the potter. God calls us to do something, but we fail as we are frail humans like frail clay. Even if we fail, all is not lost because our creator can remake us, if He made us from dust He can recreate us into something beautiful.

On the other hand, we cannot say that we have been good and demand a good future. Again the reason we are good or blessed is due to the grace of God, all we can do is Thank God for what we had and just trust Him for the future. We are just clay, we cannot demand that the potter use us for royal use only.

It does not matter what shape we are in spiritually or how good or bad we are, the important thing is to be humble and to be in the hands of the potter. We must abandon ourselves to the Lord and His will in our lives. Just as the clay is molded by the potter, we need to be led and shaped by the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit is the water flowing from the side of Christ, the temple described in Ezekiel is the Body of Christ. The water that is flowing from the east(right) side of the temple (Eze 47) is the Blood and water flowing from the right side of the Christ as depicted on the Crucifix. The water flowing from the temple brings life in all seasons in abundance. Let us be clay in the hands of the Lord being watered by the Holy Spirit, recreated every day, and renewed in our spirits.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Jeremiah 18:1-6
God told Jeremiah to go to the house of a Potter who was trying to make a pot with a specific design. Every time the design flopped the Potter tried again. This went on for several attempts until he finally got the required design.

There are many "Potter and clay" analogies in the Bible (Romans 9:21; Isaiah 29:16 and 45:9; Sirach 33:13). While in the other "Potter and clay" oracles God says that He has the right to do what He wants with the piece of clay in His hands, what Jeremiah learnt here was that in all the attempts, the Potter did not discard the original clay. He used the same clay to try over and over again.

Through the activities of daily life God was teaching Jeremiah a lesson, as He does with all of us. God was showing Jeremiah how He deals with people who fail in their given mission but want to try again.

When God chooses us for His mission we are bound to fall several times because of our pride and weak faith. When we do good works for God, it is actually God working through us and God does not work through us when pride rules our lives.
God therefore wants us to humble ourselves and keep our souls purified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly. In the meanwhile, God allows us to experience failures to mold us into a better person who will be spiritually capable of carrying out His mission. Our failures should therefore not be the cause of our depression. If we start doing God's work it is not necessary that we will see instant success.

Before we start strenuous exercise we must warm up our cold bodies or else the exercise can be harmful to us.
Similarly, our failures are a warm up for us to learn from them and to purify us while practicing patience. If there is a delay it means we are not yet spiritually ready to start the mission in full swing.

The clay did not resist the Potter‚Äôs molding and shaping. It lay still.
Let us therefore remain still like the clay and allow God to mold and shape us as He wills. Let us not resist God‚Äôs Will for us. In the meanwhile, let us make sure to humble ourselves and keep our souls purified regularly so that we can be spiritually prepared to do whatever work God wants us to do.

Jeremiah 19:6-9
This old curse (Deut. 28:53 & Leviticus 26:29) fell upon the Jews during the Aramean war (2 Kings 6:26) and also in Jerusalem in AD 70.
Let us make sure that we live our lives in total obedience to God and teach our children to do the same so that this curse may not befall us or our descendants.

Jeremiah 19:10-11
Ancient Egypt followed a rite in which they wrote the names of their enemies (persons or cities) on a jug before smashing it to symbolize what the fate of their enemies would be.

Ezekiel 47:1-2
*Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple; there, water was flowing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and the water was coming out on the south side.*

Ezekiel saw the Garden of Eden of which the old Jerusalem Temple was a replica, and the Temple was also a shadow of the Body of Christ.
However, the Garden of Eden in Ezekiel's vision, had only water flowing from the south east as in the original Garden of Eden, before sin entered the earth (Genesis 2:10), whereas, from the Jerusalem Temple, water flowed out from the south side (Gihon spring) along with the blood from the slaughtered animals because sin had entered the earth.

On the Cross, from the Body of Christ, water flowed out along with Blood (John 19:34) so that we can receive the Holy Spirit through the river of the sacraments to bring life to the whole world; water to be used for our Baptism, and Blood to be offered in atonement for our sins after our Baptism till our death.
The Temple was decorated with images of animals and flowers to resemble the Garden of Eden.

##### Day #238 By Michael Eltham

God is greater than our diet.

King Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, brought some young men from the Israelites to his palace to train them and probably give them some role in the place.

3 Then the king commanded his palace master Ashpenaz to bring some of the Israelites of the royal family and of the nobility, 4 young men without physical defect and handsome, versed in every branch of wisdom, endowed with knowledge and insight, and competent to serve in the king‚Äôs palace; they were to be taught the literature and language of the Chaldeans. 5 The king assigned them a daily portion of the royal rations of food and wine. They were to be educated for three years, so that at the end of that time they could be stationed in the king‚Äôs court. 6 Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the tribe of Judah. Daniel 1: 3-6

Now Daniel did not want to eat the food from the palace, probably offered to the pagan gods. Daniel takes a step of faith and requests to eat only vegetables and water instead of eating the rich food from the royal rations.

11 Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 12 ‚ÄúPlease test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. 13 You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations, and deal with your servants according to what you observe.‚Äù 14 So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days. 15 At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations. 16 So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables. 17 To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams. Daniel 1:11-17

Such a great Miracle ‚Äì it was initiated by Daniel‚Äôs faith.

The lesson to learn is that we should not blindly follow what the world tells us to do. Our faith and hope should be in the Lord and not in what we eat and drink. One can be too focused on diet and medicine and forget to trust God. Now diet is important, and we should follow it ‚Äì but we should trust God first. On the lighter side ‚Äì Eat your veggies is biblical üòÄand no one‚Äôs mom put it in the Bible (Line from Fr Mike).
This act of faith helped Daniel to have more faith when we accepted to interpret the dream of the King. In fact, the King actually asked the wise men to tell him what the dream was. Here we see the spotlight on intercessory prayer and how it saved the Israelite men.

17 Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 18 and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish. 19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel 2:17-19

Once God revealed the mystery to Daniel and Daniel explained it to the King. Daniel and his companions were elevated to great positions. Let us take courage from this and have faith even when all prospects seem low. Have Faith and the Lord will do Miracles.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

*Daniel to Belteshazzar, Hananiyah to Shadrach, Mishael to Meshach, and Azariyah to Abednego.*

Why the name change?
The young men's Hebrew names were unacceptable to the Babylonians because the meaning of their Hebrew names centered on the one true God:
DaniEl = Elohim is my judge;
HananiYah = Yahweh has been gracious;
MishaEl = who is what Elohim is;
AzariYah = Yahweh has helped.
(‚ÄúEl‚Äù is short for Elohim, and ‚ÄúYah‚Äù is short for Yahweh. Both are Hebrew names speaking of or praising God)

The king of Babylon had the names of Daniel and his companions changed to represent the names of the pagan gods.
The meanings of their ‚Äúnew‚Äù names centered on the false Babylonian gods:
Bel tashazzar = Bel will protect;
ShadrAch = inspired of Aku;
MeshAch = belonging to Aku;
AbedNego = servant of Nego.

The king changed their God-given identity to reflect the pagan identity.
Assigning new names was a common court practice in the ancient world. Its intention was to change the entire identity of the bearers, by training them, until their lives matched their names.
The pagan kings followed this practice to change the identity of the Jews to absorb them into the pagan culture.

What about us?
When we were baptized, we took on the name "Christian" which means ‚Äúfollower of Christ.‚Äù
How serious are we, as Christians, to change our identities until our life matches the meaning of our identity "follower of Christ"?

Have we tried to evangelize the people around us and shine our light (Matthew 5:16) to change the ungodly culture into a godly one or have we blended with the ungodly culture ourselves?

Daniel and his three companions were, however, never absorbed themselves into Babylonian culture. They neither worshipped the gods of the Babylonians nor did they eat unforbidden foods. They remained faithful to their God all through their time in Babylon.

Daniel 2:31-45
According to Daniel‚Äôs prophecy, the Messiah (the little stone) would bring the Kingdom of Heaven on earth (the Church) when the fourth kingdom (the Roman empire / iron) would be in power, the first 3 kingdoms being the Babylonian (gold), the Persian (silver) and the Greek (bronze) empires.

The Babylonian empire was in power from around 2000 BC upto the 6th century BC when it was taken over by Persia around 539 BC;
the Persian empire was in power upto the 4th century BC when it was taken over by Greece around 334 BC;
and the Greek empire was in power upto the 2nd century BC when it was taken over by Rome around 146 BC.

According to this prophecy the stone Kingdom would be universal and would spread all over the globe, but this does not mean that every single human would accept Christ.

When Christianity entered the world the pagan Roman kingdom vanished because majority of the pagans converted to Christianity by the 4th century AD.

##### Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

[![Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day239.jpg)](https://youtu.be/GSucQRQMA_E "Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah")

##### Day #239 When you walk through fire you shall not be burned

King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue and commanded everyone to worship it, however, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship this false god.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary, 20 and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 21 So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. 22 Because the king‚Äôs command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 23 But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire. Daniel 3:19-23
Can you imagine how hot this furnace must have been that even the men who tried to throw these 3 into it got burnt. The King and the audience would have expected these three to become toast in seconds, however, the fire did not affect them. They started walking around singing hymns and praising God.
They walked around in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord. 25 Then Azariah stood still in the fire and prayed aloud:
26 ‚ÄúBlessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise; and glorious is your name forever! 27 For you are just in all you have done; all your works are true and your ways right, and all your judgments are true. Dan 3:24-27
Now the King got even more furious and ordered that the fire be stoked.
Now the king‚Äôs servants who threw them in kept stoking the furnace with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brushwood. 47 And the flames poured out above the furnace forty-nine cubits, 48 and spread out and burned those Chaldeans who were caught near the furnace. 49 But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace, 50 and made the inside of the furnace as though a moist wind were whistling through it. The fire did not touch them at all and caused them no pain or distress. Dan 3:46-50
The three praised God in the midst of the fire and the Lord sent an angel to their rescue. The inside of the furnace became moist, and the fire did not touch them. This reminds me of the promise we received in Isaiah that when we go through the fire we will not be burnt, and the flames will not consume us.
‚ÄúFear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. Is 43:1-3
King Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs heart changed ‚Äì when he witnessed this great Miracle.
And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king‚Äôs counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their tunics were not harmed, and not even the smell of fire came from them. 95 Nebuchadnezzar said, ‚ÄúBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king‚Äôs command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. 96 Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.‚Äù 97 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon. Dan 3: 94-97
So the next time you face a situation where you feel that you are thrown into the fire, remember that you will not be burnt. Just praise God and sing hymns to the Lord, He will send angels to be with us and protect us. The people who threw us into the fire will see this great Miracle and change and praise God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Daniel 3:1-96
The ultimate test, for the chosen young men and all other Jews, was when the king made a gigantic golden statue of one of their false gods and commanded all the people to worship it or they would be thrown into the furnace. All the Jews bowed down to worship the false god except Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. The men were given a second chance but they refused with the trust that their God would save them from the fire, and even if God didn‚Äôt save them they wouldn‚Äôt bow down to the false god anyway.
They were eventually thrown into the fire but they remained completely unharmed inside the furnace. They walked about in the flames, praying, singing to God and blessing the Lord.

We too are living in the midst of the flames of an evil culture.
How do we respond to the ungodly culture around us?
Do we stand for Christ or do we flow with the crowd?
If we had to lose our jobs, homes, lives, position, status, reputation, or anything else, for being faithful to Christ, would we still continue following Christ and stand for the truth or would we compromise so that we look like peaceful and good people in front of others?
It is not wrong to be peaceful and good, but God doesn‚Äôt want us to be peaceful and good by rejecting His Son and His commandments.

Although God was with the 3 young men in the furnace, He did not remove them from the furnace. He was waiting with them because of their obedience to Him and, in the meanwhile, He was testing them.

If God is with us it doesn‚Äôt mean that we will be free of problems. As long as we obey God He will be with us. Facing problems when God is with us means He is testing us.

The pagan king considered himself as a god and therefore, before throwing the 3 young men into the furnace, he asked them ‚Äúwho is the God who can deliver you out of my hands?‚Äù But after seeing that the flames had not touch the 3 young men at all the king released them and gave orders that if anyone in the land spoke any word against the God of Israel that person would be cut to pieces.
Thus the Jews were able to worship the God of Israel even though they were under the pagan rule.

The 3 young men‚Äôs faith and trust in God changed the mind of the pagan king about the God of Israel and our God.
Do we have enough faith and trust in Christ to change the minds of the people around us and bring them to Christ?

Daniel 3:92
*"......... and the fourth looks like a son of God.‚Äù*
What Nebuchadnezzar saw was a heavenly being, an angel of the Lord (Daniel 3:95).

Daniel 3:25
*Azariah stood up in the midst of the fire and prayed aloud.*
Daniel didn't learn to trust God when he was protected in the lion's den (Daniel 6:16-22)) and his companions didn't learn to trust God when they were protected in the fiery furnace by the angel. Their faith was not built on the battlefield. Their faith had grown strong because of their daily humble prayers and obedience to God in every situation. This faith and obedience gave them the courage to defy the King's ungodly law.

Likewise, our daily humble prayers, preferably on our knees, and our obedience to God in every situation, is what builds up our courage to reject evil even if it means we have to go through trials and tribulations. We cannot fight the spiritual battle if we remember God occasionally or only when we are in distress.

A soldier cannot be victorious in a battle if he neglects his daily training and discipline and relaxes most of the time.
An athlete cannot win a race by training occasionally.
*It's what we do constantly that makes the difference.*

Proverbs 15:29
*The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.*

Daniel was a righteous man. When Daniel prayed God heard his prayer on day 1 but God's answer reached Daniel after 21 days because the angel was being blocked by the demons who were empowered by the increasing sins of Israel (Daniel 10:12-13).

When the Canaanite woman prayed for her daughter's deliverance from bondage Jesus was sitting near her and He heard her prayer but He did not respond to her request immediately. He wanted to test her faith before answering her prayer (Matthew 15:21-28).

God does hear the prayers of the righteous ones but the answers may not always be "yes" and the response may not always be instant. If there is a delay we need to first examine ourselves to check if we are living our lives according to God's Will or whether we have any intention to do so. If we are, then maybe God is teaching us patience, or testing our faith, or maybe we are asking for the wrong things.

##### Remaining Humble

[![Remaining Humble](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day240.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bPhv87fcq1I "Remaining Humble")

##### Day #240 Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.

We often want to serve the Lord and are willing to serve His people. But find it hard to decide what to do. There are so many good things to do, give to the poor, spend time with the lonely, preach God‚Äôs word, sing songs of praise, take care of the sick, visit the prisoners, and the list goes on.
There are unlimited things that we can do, but we find it hard to decide. The best way to do it is to commit our ways to the Lord and be led by the Spirit. We should do everything to glorify the Lord, we should always seek His plans and that is when our work will be fruitful.
All one‚Äôs ways may be pure in one‚Äôs own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirit. 3 Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established. Prov 16:2,3
We should not be like the Prophets that we read about in today‚Äôs reading. They thought their ways were good in their own eye, but we read that it was not so in the eyes of the Lord.
Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‚ÄúDo not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes; they speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord. 17 They say continually to those who despise the word of the Lord, ‚ÄòIt shall be well with you‚Äô; and to every one who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‚ÄòNo evil shall come upon you.‚Äô‚Äù Jer 23: 16-17
These prophets did as they wanted, they spoke what they wanted. They did not listen to the voice of the Lord, they never waited on the Lord for guidance.
Let us learn not to be like them, we should always be docile and teachable, we should always be humble to speak whatever the Lord tells us, and we should also be bold to speak the truth when we have to correct people. Let us commits our ways to the Lord and be led by the Holy Spirit. For unless the Lord builds the house, the builders work in vain. Let us take all our thoughts and ideas to the Lord in prayer, seeking His will, then will our plans be established. The Lord will be on our side and nothing can come against us. No weapons formed against us shall prosper.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Jeremiah 23:1-6
God allowed the Assyrians to conquer and scatter the 10 tribes because their Shepherds (the priests) led the people away from God by introducing idolatry and evil practices.

While the scattering of the Israelites was for the purpose of punishing them for their sins, God was also doing this so that the Israelites would spread the Word of God to other countries and bring the gentiles into God‚Äôs Kingdom.
If we have been forced to leave our comfort zone for any reason whatsoever, we need to thoroughly examine ourselves first, for any unconfessed sins, and then check if we have been doing God‚Äôs Will or whether we have only spent our time focusing on our own will.

In the new Covenant, in fulfillment of this prophecy (v.4-5), Jesus, the descendant of David, replaced the old shepherds (the old priesthood) by inaugurating a new priesthood (the 12 Apostles/Bishops) (John 13), who thereafter ordained more men (Jews and gentiles) to join the priesthood, to shepherd the Lord‚Äôs flock and lead them on the right path.

##### Daniel and the Den of Lions

[![Daniel and the Den of Lions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day241.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cOI53sGZx6A "Daniel and the Den of Lions")

##### Day #241 God will save us from all the conspiracy plotted against us.

People will go to any extent to get power and authority, we see this very relevant in today‚Äôs politics, in office structures, and even in our Christian circles. There is a lot of backbiting, character bashing, plots, schemes, and negative grouping that happens when someone is doing well. People try their very best to bring down another person, we act like crabs in a bucket ‚Äì trying to pull the other one down.
We see a similar situation here against Daniel. Daniel found favor with the King.
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, stationed throughout the whole kingdom, 2 and over them three presidents, including Daniel; to these the satraps gave account, so that the king might suffer no loss. 3 Soon Daniel distinguished himself above all the other presidents and satraps because an excellent spirit was in him, and the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom. 4 So the presidents and the satraps tried to find grounds for complaint against Daniel in connection with the kingdom. But they could find no grounds for complaint or any corruption, because he was faithful, and no negligence or corruption could be found in him. Dan 6:1-4
The other presidents and satraps could not find any corruption in Daniel, so they plotted against him. They made the king sign a document/order to throw to the Lions anyone who did not worship the King's god. They wanted to have Daniel thrown to the Lions by this plot.
Although Daniel knew that the document had been signed, he continued to go to his house, which had windows in its upper room open toward Jerusalem, and to get down on his knees three times a day to pray to his God and praise him, just as he had done previously. Dan 6:10
Daniel did not hesitate to continue his prayer 3 times a day where they could see him (Sometimes we need to be as courageous as Daniel) ‚Äì they brought this to the Kings attention and the King was forced to follow the order that he instituted.
16 Then the king gave the command, and Daniel was brought and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to Daniel, ‚ÄúMay your God, whom you faithfully serve, deliver you!‚Äù 17 A stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, so that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel. 18 Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no food was brought to him, and sleep fled from him.
19 Then, at break of day, the king got up and hurried to the den of lions. 20 When he came near the den where Daniel was, he cried out anxiously to Daniel, ‚ÄúO Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you faithfully serve been able to deliver you from the lions?‚Äù 21 Daniel then said to the king, ‚ÄúO king, live forever! 22 My God sent his angel and shut the lions‚Äô mouths so that they would not hurt me, because I was found blameless before him; and also before you, O king, I have done no wrong.‚Äù 23 Then the king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God. 24 The king gave a command, and those who had accused Daniel were brought and thrown into the den of lions‚Äîthey, their children, and their wives. Before they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones in pieces. Daniel 6: 16-24
This is such a beautiful faith story, the Lord saved Daniel from the Lions. The Lord saved Daniel from the evil plots made against him. And the Lord blessed Daniel with a higher position in the Kingdom.
Let us learn a life lesson from Daniel, to never fear the evil plots against us. To continue to pray and trust in the Lord, knowing that God will shut the mouths of the Lions and those who plot against us will be caught in their own nets.
Although a better prayer would be for those who plot to change if you are frustrated you can pray the below psalm as a genuine prayer from the heart. Not that we want others to be harmed, but hopefully "changed".
Contend, LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me. Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me, may ruin overtake them by surprise‚Äî may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin. Ps 35

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### King Nebuchadnezzar's Role

##### Day #242 God is in control of the nations.

We can sometimes be fearful when we look at the world news, powerful nations in conflict with each other, the threat of nuclear weapons, and nations threatening each other with missile testing. This could be overwhelming and cause a lot of fear. When we read today‚Äôs readings of Daniel‚Äôs visions ‚Äì we have consolation that God knows what is happening and knows the future.
In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me at first. 2 In the vision I was looking and saw myself in Susa the capital, in the province of Elam, and I was by the river Ulai.3 I looked up and saw a ram standing beside the river. It had two horns. Both horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up second. 4 I saw the ram charging westward and northward and southward. All beasts were powerless to withstand it, and no one could rescue from its power; it did as it pleased and became strong.
5 As I was watching, a male goat appeared from the west, coming across the face of the whole earth without touching the ground. The goat had a horn between its eyes. 6 It came toward the ram with the two horns that I had seen standing beside the river, and it ran at it with savage force. 7 I saw it approaching the ram. It was enraged against it and struck the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram did not have power to withstand it; it threw the ram down to the ground and trampled upon it, and there was no one who could rescue the ram from its power. 8 Then the male goat grew exceedingly great; but at the height of its power, the great horn was broken, and in its place there came up four prominent horns toward the four winds of heaven. Daniel 8:1-8
Of Course, Daniel did not understand the vision of the rams and the goats. But God sends angel Gabriel to explain the visions to Daniel, remember Angel Gabriel is the one who always brings messages from God. We should pray and ask got help from God to understand the times and the tension between the nations. God will send Angel Gabriel to help us understand what‚Äôs going on.
As for the ram that you saw with the two horns, these are the kings of Media and Persia. 21 The male goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between its eyes is the first king. 22 As for the horn that was broken, in place of which four others arose, four kingdoms shall arise from his nation, but not with his power. Dan 8
Also, God will show us the right path to take and tell us who to listen to, sometimes like Jeremiah we may be asked to listen to the ruler who to us seems evil. The Babylonian kings were the ones who invaded Israel and took them captive. It must have been strange when the prophet Jeremiah prophecies that the people should listen to him and live. But God‚Äôs ways are not our ways, He knows the future and can change any situation, nation, or King. Let us just trust the Lord and His message for us.
17 Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Jer 17:7
Let us not fear, but pray and trust in the Lord, for God holds the nations.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 242 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 26:1-9
Shiloh was the place where the Ark of the Covenant was kept so the people in Jerusalem thought that as long as the Ark was with them they could do whatever they wanted because they had the protection of the Ark and so no enemy could touch them.
Shiloh was ultimately destroyed by the Philistines.

Jeremiah was reminding the people that the Ark did not have some kind of magic to repel their enemies. Their ancestors were protected by the Ark because they were humble and obedient to God's commandments. But since disobedience is the result of pride, whenever pride ruled the hearts of the people God left them and they fell into the hands of the evil forces because sin separates us from God and thus opens the door for the entry of the devil.

Baptism, spending long hours in prayer, doing works of charity, involving ourselves in Charismatic activities, etc. are all good but they are not a guarantee that we will receive eternal life. As long as pride rules our hearts, everything that we do will be in vain. We must therefore always be humble and obedient to God and try to live in a state of grace.

The priests and all the people were angry with Jeremiah and wanted to kill him because he spoke of the destruction of the Temple. But Jeremiah was not cursing the Temple; he was only warning the people.

Some centuries later the priests and all the people were angry with Jesus and wanted to kill him because he spoke of the destruction of the Temple. But Jesus too was not cursing the Temple; he was only warning the people.

Daniel 9:1-2
*In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede, who became king over the realm of the Chaldeans, in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah, must be fulfilled for the devastation of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.*

Exile would be for 70 years because the people of God had lived in the promised land for 490 years but neglected to observe the Sabbatical years, that is, rest for the land every 7 years. Therefore the land would receive its rest by moving the people out of the land.

The purpose of sending the people into exile was, however, so that they will turn back to the Lord by repenting and purifying themselves. But unfortunately the exile didn't make any difference to them.

When our hearts are hardened and we go through sufferings and problems because of our sinful way of life, we usually try to get rid of our sufferings and problems by adopting new sinful methods and we ignore our spiritual purity. Thus we end up sinking deeper in sin.

Daniel was not selfishly asking for forgiveness only for himself. He was not looking only for *his* freedom from exile. Daniel, in his humility, was repenting on behalf of *his sinful nation*.

Like Daniel, we too must make it a regular practice to pray for all sinners that they may return back to God.

##### The Lord's Plans

[![The Lord's Plans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day243.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VQfD3oPeRX4 "The Lord's Plans")

##### Day #243 God‚Äôs plan for us is for our welfare not for evil.

We have read a lot about the false prophets, and how to speak on their own, they do not seek the Lord‚Äôs will. They only say words of comfort and prosperity, instead of speaking a message of repentance (the people were in a state of sin and needed to repent). Prophet Jeremiah was walking around with a yoke on his neck, as a visible icon that would remind the people that they are under the yoke of sin and are slaves because of their rebellion. Prophet Jeremiah heard from the Lord that Israel will be in exile for 70 years and after that, they will be restored back to Israel.
However, prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah speaks a false message that the yoke will be broken in 2 years. Prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah took the wooden yoke off Jeremiah and broke it, and Jeremiah went his way.
10 Then the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke them. 11 And Hanani‚Ä≤ah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, ‚ÄúThus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.‚Äù But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
12 Sometime after the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 ‚ÄúGo, tell Hanani‚Ä≤ah, ‚ÄòThus says the Lord: You have broken wooden bars, but I will make in their place bars of iron. 14 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.‚Äô‚Äù 15 And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah, ‚ÄúListen, Hanani‚Ä≤ah, the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. 16 Therefore thus says the Lord: ‚ÄòBehold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù
17 In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah died. Jer 28
The word of the Lord then came to Jeremiah that even though prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah broke the wooden bars but the Lord will place Iron bars on Israel and that they cannot break, and will serve King Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar. Prophet Jeremiah also prophesied that the false prophet will die this very year which happened. Now we need to be clear that God does not want to keep the people of Israel in exile, but wants them to repent. The thing that is most precious in the Lord‚Äôs sight is our soul, it is the most precious thing to us as well(we just don‚Äôt know it, we think our body is the most important thing.) The Lord will permit physical suffering if it cleanses the soul, the Israelites wanted the blessings of the Lord but did not want to be His.
This could be the struggle in our lives as well, we may be seeking the Lord only for the things of this world and not bother much about our soul and the next world. God‚Äôs plans for us to prosper us ‚Äì the best way to prosper us is to make our souls pure. Even if the Lord gave us abundant earthly prosperity ‚Äì we will never be satisfied. The only way we will be whole is when we become holy/complete/whole, of course not on our own but by what Christ did for us on the cross. So when we experience suffering on earth it may just be the yoke that Lord wants us to carry, so that it will condition our hearts and purify our souls to holiness.
Through the process of purification, we may get so frustrated with the yoke/suffering in our life that we just want to break it. This will not help, trying to avoid suffering will not help us progress. We need to pickup our cross and follow the Lord daily. If we break the yoke of wood, the Lord will place a yoke of iron. Let us accept the sufferings and allow them to melt and mold our hearts.
10 ‚ÄúFor thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfil to you my promise and bring you back to this place. 11 For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13 You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart, 14 I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile. Jer 29:10-14
Many times this verse is misused to mean that God will give us great earthly fortunes and prosper us, this may be the case sometimes. But we should not focus on earthly riches and abundance our focus should be on our spiritual life. The only way to be satisfied is to be in love with Jesus, connected to the Vine we will receive all the necessary nutrients. We need not worry about tomorrow or the earthly things ‚Äì for the Lord feeds the birds of the air and clothes the lilies of the valley. Instead of dreaming of riches we should focus on the Lord and knowing Him more.
When we suffer like the people of Israel, let us remember that God has plans for us, to restore us to himself. We will go home like the Israelites, even though sin has held us captive, as were repent the Lord will deliver us and prosper us. Once we come into a state of spiritual wholeness, we won‚Äôt even bother about the other things that much. We will also receive an abundance of earthly riches because we will know how to use them properly and not be attached to them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 243 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 29:11
*For I know the plans I have for you declares the lord, plans to prosper you, not to harm you; plans to give you a future with hope.*

This message from God was not a promise to prosper each person separately. The promise was meant for the whole community of God‚Äôs people for a better future. When God said ‚Äúyou‚Äù it was a plural ‚Äúyou,‚Äù not a singular ‚Äúyou.‚Äù God was giving the whole community an assurance of a better future because of the bad news they heard regarding the long exilic period.
This message was, however, not meant only for the old Israel. It is the same message for the new Israel (the Church). It is a message for the community of believers until the end of time.

In the present time, even if we have been prosperous in this material world, this promise is not for individual material prosperity. It is not about ‚ÄúI, me, myself.‚Äù It is about ‚Äúus.‚Äù God is speaking to the whole community of believers. God sees all believers as one family, and no loving father will protect and prosper only a few of his children from his family and leave the others to suffer.

Physical exile caused the people to go through much suffering and distress because their mortal sins separated them from God, and this put them in the custody of Satan.
But physical exile was just a shadow of spiritual exile, which is spiritual separation from God due to mortal sins. Spiritual exile also leads to suffering and distress.

When we commit mortal sins we choose the devil over God and although our mortal sins separate us from God, God does not abandon us. God promised that if we call out to Him and pray to Him, He will hear us (v.12). God also promised that if we seek Him with all our hearts He will let us find Him and He will lift us up from our suffering and bring us back from our spiritual exile (v.13).

This was a promise of hope when God would come down to earth to dwell with His people in the new Covenant through the Sacraments, until the end of time, and thus bring all His children back from their spiritual exile.

We may be suffering as a community because of our own sins or because of the sins of others. We may be going through persecutions or oppression because of our faith.
Since the whole Body (of Christ) suffers when any one part is out of order, we need to pray for each other as a community.

Let us therefore meet together at God‚Äôs appointed place of worship (the Church), call out to Him and pray to Him as one community, as one family, as one Body of Christ (Matthew 6:9-13) and He will hear us.

Let us not delay in seeking the Lord with all our hearts during Mass so that He can let us find Him (Luke 11:9 & 13; Luke 18:7-8) and He can lift us up from our suffering and bring us back from our spiritual exile through the Sacraments.

Daniel 10:2
*At that time I, Daniel, had been mourning for three weeks. I had eaten no rich food, no meat or wine had entered my mouth, and I had not anointed myself at all, for the full three weeks.*

This is known as "Daniel fasting."
This is the type of fasting we observe during the season of Lent.

A person observing ‚ÄúDaniel fasting‚Äù must avoid all delicious food including meat, fish and any kind of alcohol, and must eat only simple food.
We deny our body the pleasure of the foods and drinks which we love. We sacrifice them. We don‚Äôt lose out on anything but instead we gain the grace of controlling the desires of our flesh.
During the season of Lent we must eat to live and not live to eat.

But giving up our favorite/delicious foods and drinks is not fasting unless the fasting is accompanied with praying, reading the scriptures, confessing our sins, etc.

Daniel 10:12-20
"Prince of Persia" and "prince of Greece" are demons assigned to these regions. Just as God has separate angels assigned to different regions and people (Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, etc.), Satan also has separate demons assigned to different regions and people. The angels and demons are in constant battle and they are represented by the people to whom they are assigned (Revelation 16:13-14).

The accumulation of mortal sins makes Satan‚Äôs army stronger and more powerful, thus making it difficult for our angels to protect us. Wars, pestilence, famines, earthquakes, etc. are all results of unforgiven mortal sins of God‚Äôs people (the Israelites & the Christians).

Israel was sinking deep in sin (Daniel 9:11-14) and Daniel seemed to be the only one man in the whole of Israel who was pleasing to God because he was asking for forgiveness not only for his sins but also for the sins of his people (Daniel 10:11 & 19), but God still heard his prayer on day one and sent an answer.

When we pray, God hears our prayers the very first day, whether one person is praying or many, but how long it takes for the angel to reach us with God‚Äôs answer depends on what we are asking for and how strong our angelic army is. The answer may or may not be in our favour therefore we must not expect a positive response from God.
While he was waiting for God‚Äôs answer (Daniel 9:12-13), Daniel repented for his sins and for the sins of his nation. He also did penance for the sins by fasting, mourning and praying.

While we are waiting for God to answer our prayers, God may be expecting something from us. God is well aware of each and every thing that is happening on the earth. Satan cannot harm God‚Äôs people without God‚Äôs permission and God allows problems in our lives for a reason. Therefore, whenever we are in distress, while we ask the Lord to save us, let us not forget to examine ourselves for any unforgiven sins and repent, if any, while we also ask Him to help us know His Will for us. In the meanwhile, let us ensure that we obey God‚Äôs commandments and wait patiently for Him to send us His answer, whether positive or negative.

On the other hand, if we know someone who is living in sin and has not repented then, like Daniel, let us intercede for them and ask the Lord to have mercy on them, instead of being quick to point our finger and highlight their sins.

‚ÄúThe prince of Persia‚Äù was the demon over Persia who was battling with Michael and impeding Gabriel, but success came by way of the Persian kings who eventually allowed Israel to rebuild the Temple and the city. However, the prince of Greece (the demon power over Greece) would prove more formidable and would later inspire Antiochus to desecrate the temple and devastate the city. This is about the spiritual warfare going on in the spiritual realm, and mirrors and brings about the battles we see in the material realm, depending on whom we serve, God or Satan.

Gabriel was speaking of the Persian demon as a current event and of the Greek demon as a future event.

##### Susanna's Righteousness

[![Susanna's Righteousness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/August/jpgs/Day244.jpg)](https://youtu.be/J_sr52dXJHE "Susanna's Righteousness")

##### Day #244 Abusers prey on the innocent and don‚Äôt hesitate to misuse authority for their own gain

Abuse is a really sensitive topic to discuss, even talking about abuse can cause grief to some of those who were abused. Unfortunately, there are not enough of Daniels in this world today, who can stand up for the innocent and bring justice. Susanna was very beautiful and righteous; her parents did a good job bringing her up. She is now married to a really nice person who is the most honored of all Jews in the town, he owed a beautiful garden which the Judges used to hear the people‚Äôs cases. This is such a lovely setting and there is so much harmony in the lives of Susanna and her husband. However, two of the Judges started lusting over her and they plotted to fulfill their lust when she come into the garden to take a bath (she would come in once everyone left). The two elders hid in the bushes and when her maids left, they tried to seduce her.
19 When the maids had gone out, the two elders got up and ran to her. 20 They said, ‚ÄúLook, the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us. We are burning with desire for you; so give your consent, and lie with us. 21 If you refuse, we will testify against you that a young man was with you, and this was why you sent your maids away.‚Äù
22 Susanna groaned and said, ‚ÄúI am completely trapped. For if I do this, it will mean death for me; if I do not, I cannot escape your hands. 23 I choose not to do it; I will fall into your hands, rather than sin in the sight of the Lord.‚Äù
24 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the two elders shouted against her. 25 And one of them ran and opened the garden doors. 26 When the people in the house heard the shouting in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her. 27 And when the elders told their story, the servants felt very much ashamed, for nothing like this had ever been said about Susanna. Daniel 13: 19-24
Now the elders being Judges were going to pass judgment on her and stone her to death. They were accusing her of this crime she had never committed. She cried out to the Lord in tears for she was innocent of any sin.
44 The Lord heard her cry. 45 Just as she was being led off to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young lad named Daniel, 46 and he shouted with a loud voice, ‚ÄúI want no part in shedding this woman‚Äôs blood!‚Äù
Daniel Rescues Susanna
47 All the people turned to him and asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this you are saying?‚Äù 48 Taking his stand among them he said, ‚ÄúAre you such fools, O Israelites, as to condemn a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts? 49 Return to court, for these men have given false evidence against her.‚Äù
50 So all the people hurried back. And the rest of the elders said to him, ‚ÄúCome, sit among us and inform us, for God has given you the standing of an elder.‚Äù 51 Daniel said to them, ‚ÄúSeparate them far from each other, and I will examine them.‚Äù
52 When they were separated from each other, he summoned one of them and said to him, ‚ÄúYou old relic of wicked days, your sins have now come home, which you have committed in the past, 53 pronouncing unjust judgments, condemning the innocent and acquitting the guilty, though the Lord said, ‚ÄòYou shall not put an innocent and righteous person to death.‚Äô 54 Now then, if you really saw this woman, tell me this: Under what tree did you see them being intimate with each other?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúUnder a mastic tree.‚Äù 55 And Daniel said, ‚ÄúVery well! This lie has cost you your head, for the angel of God has received the sentence from God and will immediately cut you in two.‚Äù
56 Then, putting him to one side, he ordered them to bring the other. And he said to him, ‚ÄúYou offspring of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has beguiled you and lust has perverted your heart. 57 This is how you have been treating the daughters of Israel, and they were intimate with you through fear; but a daughter of Judah would not tolerate your wickedness. 58 Now then, tell me: Under what tree did you catch them being intimate with each other?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúUnder an evergreen oak.‚Äù 59 Daniel said to him, ‚ÄúVery well! This lie has cost you also your head, for the angel of God is waiting with his sword to split you in two, so as to destroy you both.‚Äù
60 Then the whole assembly raised a great shout and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him. 61 And they took action against the two elders, because out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness; they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor. 62 Acting in accordance with the law of Moses, they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was spared that day. Dan 13
Praise God! It‚Äôs such an inspiring story that we can read and re-read. In this case, the innocent was saved, but that is not the case most of the time. We see time and again how people in power get away with abuse, it happens in almost all walks of life, politics, sports, the film industry, schools, and even in the church. Just like they say ‚ÄúCrime has no zip code‚Äù abuse can happen anywhere even in a family setting, even parents who are supposed to protect the children have abused them. We need more Susannas and Daniels in this world today, we need people who are righteous and brave enough to stand up for the innocent. Let us take a moment to pray for those who have been abused and pray for protection over the innocent of the world.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #245 Man Made gods

Praise God that we all worship the true God who made heaven and the earth and follow true religion. Although we may not outright worship an idol, we may tend to distort the true God and make an idol out of the true God. Daniel was faced with situations where the people were worshiping dead idols or a powerful real living creature a Dragon. Daniel demonstrates how these man-made gods are not really God. That the true God made all these creatures.
3 Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel, and every day they provided for it twelve bushels of choice flour and forty sheep and six measures of wine. 4 The king revered it and went every day to worship it. But Daniel worshiped his own God.
So the king said to him, ‚ÄúWhy do you not worship Bel?‚Äù 5 He answered, ‚ÄúBecause I do not revere idols made with hands, but the living God, who created heaven and earth and has dominion over all living creatures.‚Äù
6 The king said to him, ‚ÄúDo you not think that Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?‚Äù 7 And Daniel laughed, and said, ‚ÄúDo not be deceived, O king, for this thing is only clay inside and bronze outside, and it never ate or drank anything.‚Äù
8 Then the king was angry and called the priests of Bel and said to them, ‚ÄúIf you do not tell me who is eating these provisions, you shall die. 9 But if you prove that Bel is eating them, Daniel shall die, because he has spoken blasphemy against Bel.‚Äù Daniel said to the king, ‚ÄúLet it be done as you have said.‚Äù
10 Now there were seventy priests of Bel, besides their wives and children. So the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. 11 The priests of Bel said, ‚ÄúSee, we are now going outside; you yourself, O king, set out the food and prepare the wine, and shut the door and seal it with your signet. 12 When you return in the morning, if you do not find that Bel has eaten it all, we will die; otherwise Daniel will, who is telling lies about us.‚Äù 13 They were unconcerned, for beneath the table they had made a hidden entrance, through which they used to go in regularly and consume the provisions. 14 After they had gone out, the king set out the food for Bel. Then Daniel ordered his servants to bring ashes, and they scattered them throughout the whole temple in the presence of the king alone. Then they went out, shut the door and sealed it with the king‚Äôs signet, and departed. 15 During the night the priests came as usual, with their wives and children, and they ate and drank everything.
16 Early in the morning the king rose and came, and Daniel with him. 17 The king said, ‚ÄúAre the seals unbroken, Daniel?‚Äù He answered, ‚ÄúThey are unbroken, O king.‚Äù 18 As soon as the doors were opened, the king looked at the table, and shouted in a loud voice, ‚ÄúYou are great, O Bel, and in you there is no deceit at all!‚Äù
19 But Daniel laughed and restrained the king from going in. ‚ÄúLook at the floor,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand notice whose footprints these are.‚Äù 20 The king said, ‚ÄúI see the footprints of men and women and children.‚Äù
21 Then the king was enraged, and he arrested the priests and their wives and children. They showed him the secret doors through which they used to enter to consume what was on the table. 22 Therefore the king put them to death, and gave Bel over to Daniel, who destroyed it and its temple.
Daniel Kills the Dragon
23 Now in that place there was a great dragon, which the Babylonians revered. 24 The king said to Daniel, ‚ÄúYou cannot deny that this is a living god; so worship him.‚Äù 25 Daniel said, ‚ÄúI worship the Lord my God, for he is the living God. 26 But give me permission, O king, and I will kill the dragon without sword or club.‚Äù The king said, ‚ÄúI give you permission.‚Äù
27 Then Daniel took pitch, fat, and hair, and boiled them together and made cakes, which he fed to the dragon. The dragon ate them, and burst open. Then Daniel said, ‚ÄúSee what you have been worshiping!‚Äù
Daniel was full of the wisdom of God and he was able to expose the corruption of the priests.
We face similar situations in our modern lives, one tries to make created things into God. Some people dedicate their whole lives to becoming rich, beautiful, famous, and powerful. We make gods out of people, political parties, sports icons, movie stars, etc.. We make God out of things, like house, cars, jobs, and relationships. When we have God first in our lives, our priorities are correct and we are on the right path.
THE CORRECT PRIORITY SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.

1. GOD
2. FAMILY
3. JOB
4. MINISTRY
5. FRIENDS AND POSSESSIONS

If we have the priorities in the above order, we will have a harmonious life. Putting others first will bring us JOY. We all know this good old formula
JOY
J = Jesus First
O = others Next
Y = Yourself last.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 245 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 31:6
*A day will come when the watchmen call out on Mount Ephraim, ‚ÄúCome, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD, our God.*

Ephraim was the tribe which provided kings. The northern tribes had cut themselves off from the Temple and the licit valid worship of God, the Temple being in the south. Jeremiah prophesied reconciliation between northern and southern tribes because Ephraim would talk about going to mount Zion in the south, in the future.

This prophecy was fulfilled when the Judaeans from the south (Acts 2:14) and the Samaritans from the north (Acts 8:4, 12, 14) came into the Church, the new Zion.

Jeremiah 31:34
*"I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.‚Äù*

God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

##### Rejoice in Doing Good

[![Rejoice in Doing Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day246.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mwmk2EmKf8M "Rejoice in Doing Good")

##### Day #246 God does not resentfully help us but rejoices in doing good to us.

When we commit sin our natural tendency is to stop praying or to run away from God. One tries to avoid a God encounter because we have hurt our all-loving God. We feel that God is upset with us and is very angry with us, we try to associate the experience that we had as children. Children tend to avoid their parents when they have made a mistake, knowing that they will be punished for the wrongs. This has been written so deep into us that we try to run away from God when we sin, we try to hide like Adam and Eve. We try to cover up our shame and hide our mistakes from God, but God knows it all. God knows us better than we know ourselves, we may run but can never escape God.
On the contrary, we should run to God, because He is a loving, merciful, and forgiving God. When Adam and eve committed sin, they were hiding but God came in search of them. Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the Lost sheep. When Peter denied Jesus 3 times, Jesus did not rebuke him but offered him another chance, he entrusted him with being the shepherd of the flock again. Our God is different from anything we have ever experienced, God wants to forgive us and give us another chance. God does not do this out of reluctance but rejoices to do us good.
I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.Jer 32:14
There is great rejoicing when one sinner repents than over 99 who did not need to repent. God loves the sinner and understands us, Jesus took on this weak human nature and knows how frail we truly are.
The next time you need forgiveness, do not run away but run towards the Lord. He is waiting with arms wide open.
Let us then approach God‚Äôs throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:19
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 246 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 32:40
*I will make an everlasting covenant with them.*

The old Covenant did not have a provision for renewal because a price has to be paid by a priest, with holy blood, to make atonement, whenever God's Covenant is broken. Therefore it was not an everlasting Covenant.

The new Covenant is everlasting because Jesus, our High Priest, paid the price by offering His physical holy blood, once for all. Thereafter, whenever we break the new Covenant with our sins, God renews it through the Sacrament of Reconciliation and when we receive the sacramental Body and Blood of Christ (Communion), which was offered by an Apostolic priest, in atonement for our sins.

##### True Repentance

[![True Repentance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day247.jpg)](https://youtu.be/brdYj4UPNfw "True Repentance")

##### DAY #247 TRUE REPENTANCE BRINGS CHANGE

The people of Israel were under siege, and they had limited supplies, they were finding it hard to feed their families and the slaves. When the word of the Lord came to free the slaves, they readily accepted it but not out of obedience but because this was convenient for them in the time of famine. Once the enemies left, they decided to take back the slaves to do their hard work.
Let us take a read.
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. 9 Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. 10 So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. 11 But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.
12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 ‚ÄúThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, 14 ‚ÄòEvery seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.‚Äô Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. 15 Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. 16 But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.
17 ‚ÄúTherefore this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô for you, declares the Lord‚Äî‚Äòfreedom‚Äô to fall by the sword, plague and famine. Jeremiah 34: 8-17
The Lord knows the hearts of these people, they freed the slaves for their convenience and took them back when they wanted. This is just unfair to the slaves, and the people who committed this sin brought upon themselves sword, plague and famine.
Sometimes we tend to make this kind of half-hearted confession, we may not truly repent from our sin but make a confession because we want to get away from the punishment. We happily pick up the same sin again when we feel like it. Our repentance is short-lived and we go back into the same old filth. Repentance is not just about confessing our sins, but about changing our ways as well.
Jesus always told people to sin no more.
After Jesus healed the man at the pool, he found him and told him not to sin anymore.
Later Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, ‚ÄúSee, you have been made well! Do not sin any more, so that nothing worse happens to you.‚Äù John 5:14
Jesus also gave the same instruction to others who He healed and delivered.
Let us take this instruction to heart today, and try to even avoid the near occasion of sin. May God the Holy Spirit help us in our weakness. And if we ever fall back into sin, let us sincerely repent and walk again in truth.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Cut to the Heart

[![Cut to the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day248.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jJ24ExMKoFc "Cut to the Heart")

##### Day #248 Does suffering make you bitter or better?

The proverb in today‚Äôs reading hits the nail on the head about suffering and testing. Fine metals are made pure by heating in the furnace and shaped by hammering when red hot. The human heart is made pure by testing and suffering.

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, but the Lord tests the heart. Prov 17:3

Today we see how the Rechabites have been faithfully following the instructions of their fathers, to not drink wine. They were testing and passed the test.

We need to ask ourselves: will we pass the test? Let‚Äôs read.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of King Jehoiakim son of Josiah of Judah:

2 Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them to the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers; then offer them wine to drink. 3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah son of Habazziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. 4 I brought them to the house of the Lord into the chamber of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, ‚ÄúHave some wine.‚Äù 6 But they answered, ‚ÄúWe will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‚ÄòYou shall never drink wine, neither you nor your children; 7 nor shall you ever build a house, or sow seed; nor shall you plant a vineyard, or even own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you reside.‚Äô 8 We have obeyed the charge of our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, 9 and not to build houses to live in. We have no vineyard or field or seed; 10 but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done all that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 11 But when King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‚ÄòCome, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.‚Äô That is why we are living in Jerusalem.‚Äù

12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Can you not learn a lesson and obey my words? says the Lord. Jer 33:1-13

In the book of Judith, we see the Israelites in distress, they have been surrounded by their enemies for 35 days now and are running low on supplies. The water in their cisterns is drying up and people are fainting on the streets due to thirst. They came to the point of giving up and wanted to surrender. They were willing to surrender and become slaves of the enemies. But then the word of the Lord came to Uzziah and he encouraged them to hold on a little longer for 5 more days.

29 Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice. 30 But Uzziah said to them, ‚ÄúCourage, my brothers and sisters! Let us hold out for five days more; by that time the Lord our God will turn his mercy to us again, for he will not forsake us utterly. 31 But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do as you say.‚Äù
32 Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went up on the walls and towers of their town. The women and children he sent home. In the town they were in great misery. Judith 7: 29-32

As we continue to read the book of Judith, we will see how God saves them from their enemies. The lesson to learn today from them is to keep strong in times of suffering, trusting God and knowing that we just need to hold on a little longer for help is on the way. Let us be encouraged by this story from the bible, even if we are weak and fainting and see no way out ‚Äì if we want to give in and surrender to the enemy ‚Äì we should not. Stay strong, stay brave, for you are under testing, the Lord will soon bring you help.

You are precious to the Lord like gold is precious to people. The Lord is refining you by testing. Your suffering is meant to help you grown in holiness.

But does your suffering make you bitter or better?

Don‚Äôt worry if you answered bitter, you could get better. You will have many more chances of suffering and testing and hopefully we can become better. When we encounter suffering let us praise God and offer up our suffering for those who need our prayers. Our bitter will slowly become better.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Prayer of Judith

[![Prayer of Judith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day249.jpg)](https://youtu.be/f27psD92Kv8 "Prayer of Judith")

##### Day #249 Setting a deadline for our petitions is like putting God to the test.

Who said beauty, wisdom, and goodness cannot be found together in a woman, we have a heroine from the Old Testament ‚ÄúJudith‚Äù who has all these qualities.

We are all aware of the long-suffering they were going through, people are fainting due to lack of drinking water. Uzziah come up with a hack of an idea to wait for 5 more days and if God does not come to their aid, they would surrender. Judith was witnessing all this commotion and holds them to the truth.
Judith and the Elders

9 When Judith heard the harsh words spoken by the people against the ruler, because they were faint for lack of water, and when she heard all that Uzziah said to them, and how he promised them under oath to surrender the town to the Assyrians after five days, 10 she sent her maid, who was in charge of all she possessed, to summon Uzziah and Chabris and Charmis, the elders of her town. 11 They came to her, and she said to them:
‚ÄúListen to me, rulers of the people of Bethulia! What you have said to the people today is not right; you have even sworn and pronounced this oath between God and you, promising to surrender the town to our enemies unless the Lord turns and helps us within so many days. 12 Who are you to put God to the test today, and to set yourselves up in the place of God in human affairs? 13 You are putting the Lord Almighty to the test, but you will never learn anything! 14 You cannot plumb the depths of the human heart or understand the workings of the human mind; how do you expect to search out God, who made all these things, and find out his mind or comprehend his thought? No, my brothers, do not anger the Lord our God. 15 For if he does not choose to help us within these five days, he has power to protect us within any time he pleases, or even to destroy us in the presence of our enemies. 16 Do not try to bind the purposes of the Lord our God; for God is not like a human being, to be threatened, or like a mere mortal, to be won over by pleading. 17 Therefore, while we wait for his deliverance, let us call upon him to help us, and he will hear our voice, if it pleases him. Judith 8:9-17

Yes, indeed we cannot set a timeline for God to work, they were setting a timeline of 5 days for God to answer their prayers. Which is nothing but putting God to the test, it‚Äôs like throwing God a challenge ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt answer our prayers in 5 days we will surrender. Judith in her wisdom brought out this aspect of testing God and saved the Israelites from going into slavery.
Sometimes we need to be aware that we are putting God to the test when we pray prayers like, ‚ÄúPlease give me a job within this month‚Äù or ‚ÄúHeal me at service today‚Äù.

Our attitude should be more like ‚Äì ‚ÄúLord I offer my prayer to you and know you can do things instantly but if you want me to bear this cross longer so be it."

We should not be making prayers like bribes ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you answer this petition, I will donate $1000‚Äù.
Our prayers should be prayers of faith, thanking God for what we are asking for, and knowing that He will grant what is best for us in His time. -Michael Eltham

We should stop putting deadlines to our prayers to be answered, building character, faith and trust is more important than results.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 249 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 38:4‚Äì6
*Then the princes said to the king, ‚ÄúLet this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.‚Äù King Zedekiah said, ‚ÄúBehold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.‚Äù So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king‚Äôs son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.*

Jeremiah was a foreshadow of Jesus.
Some centuries later Jesus also went through a similar experience.
Like Jeremiah and Jesus, Christians also may have to go through a similar experience during their lifetime.
When the Word of God is preached the evil one gets very disturbed and he therefore stirs up his disciples to block the Word from reaching millions of people by getting rid of the preachers.

##### Final Wave of Exile

[![Final Wave of Exile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day250.jpg)](https://youtu.be/U8IW-EHokos "Final Wave of Exile")

##### Day #250 Choosing God‚Äôs will or the easy way out?

We are reading about the final exile of the Israelites, the fall of Jerusalem. Now the captain of the guard of Jeremiah must have seen something in him or must have recognized that this prophet is truly from God. He offers to take Jeremiah with him and to keep him comfortable.
2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, ‚ÄúThe Lord your God threatened this place with this disaster; 3 and now the Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said, because all of you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice. Therefore this thing has come upon you. 4 Now look, I have just released you today from the fetters on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take good care of you; but if you do not wish to come with me to Babylon, you need not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. 5 If you remain, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or go wherever you think it right to go.‚Äù So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. 6 Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land. Jeremiah 40:2-6
If anyone of us were given this offer, we may have chosen to go with the captain. Now Jeremiah was not a person to seek out an easy life, all he wanted to do was "the will of God". He decides to stay with the poor in desolate Jerusalem.
Let us learn a life lesson from this prophet Jeremiah, that the most important thing to do is the will of the Lord. In life, we will be given multiple options, and more often than not, we tend to pick what is easy over the right thing to do.
Let‚Äôs look at a couple of examples.

1. If you go to the store and your kid hides a toy and does not check it out, would you go back to the store and tell them what happened or just say ‚Äúthese stores overcharge us ‚Äì it‚Äôs good we got to take something from them‚Äù
2. If your teenage kid comes back to you and says she is pregnant, would you allow her to have an abortion or ask her to raise the kid and learn a life lesson.
   Hopefully, we will have the courage to do the will of God, when we are faced with these hard decisions in our lives.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Judith and Holofernes

[![Judith and Holofernes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day251.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vPnfDIwTaZY "Judith and Holofernes")

##### Day #251 Drunkenness can cause you to let your guard down.

It‚Äôs worth reading the whole episode on how Judith kills Holofernes.
Judith Attends Holofernes‚Äô Banquet
10 On the fourth day Holofer‚Ä≤nes held a banquet for his slaves only, and did not invite any of his officers. 11 And he said to Bago‚Ä≤as, the eunuch who had charge of all his personal affairs, ‚ÄúGo now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to join us and eat and drink with us. 12 For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at us.‚Äù 13 So Bago‚Ä≤as went out from the presence of Holofer‚Ä≤nes, and approached her and said, ‚ÄúThis beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us, and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve in the house of Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar.‚Äù 14 And Judith said, ‚ÄúWho am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day of my death!‚Äù 15 So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman‚Äôs finery, and her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofer‚Ä≤nes the soft fleeces which she had received from Bago‚Ä≤as for her daily use, so that she might recline on them when she ate.
16 Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofer‚Ä≤nes‚Äô heart was ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her; for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since the day he first saw her. 17 So Holofer‚Ä≤nes said to her. ‚ÄúDrink now, and be merry with us!‚Äù 18 Judith said, ‚ÄúI will drink now, my lord, because my life means more to me today than in all the days since I was born.‚Äù 19 Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared. 20 And Holofer‚Ä≤nes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born.
13 When evening came, his slaves quickly withdrew, and Bago‚Ä≤as closed the tent from outside and shut out the attendants from his master‚Äôs presence; and they went to bed, for they all were weary because the banquet had lasted long. 2 So Judith was left alone in the tent , with Holofer‚Ä≤nes stretched out on his bed, for he was overcome with wine.
3 Now Judith had told her maid to stand outside the bedchamber and to wait for her to come out, as she did every day; for she said she would be going out for her prayers. And she had said the same thing to Bago‚Ä≤as. 4 So every one went out, and no one, either small or great, was left in the bedchamber. Then Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart, ‚ÄúO Lord God of all might, look in this hour upon the work of my hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem. 5 For now is the time to help thy inheritance, and to carry out my undertaking for the destruction of the enemies who have risen up against us.‚Äù
6 She went up to the post at the end of the bed, above Holofer‚Ä≤nes‚Äô head, and took down his sword that hung there. 7 She came close to his bed and took hold of the hair of his head, and said, ‚ÄúGive me strength this day, O Lord God of Israel!‚Äù 8 And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and severed his head from his body. 9 Then she tumbled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the posts; after a moment she went out, and gave Holofer‚Ä≤nes‚Äô head to her maid, 10 who placed it in her food bag. Judith 12: 10-16, 13:1-10
Although it‚Äôs not an explicit sin to drink alcohol, alcohol can open the door to other sins. When you consume alcohol in excess you let down your guard and would do things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do. Although drinking alcohol is not a sin, drunkenness is a grave sin that will not permit you to go to heaven.
Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor: 9,10
We read in today‚Äôs readings that Holofernes drank much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since he was born. This led to him letting his guard down and gave Judith an opportunity to strike his head with a sword and kill him.
Let us all pray for the virtue of temperance, it the virtue that will help us avoid any kind of excess whether it be food drink or tobacco.
The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess: the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco, or medicine. Those incur grave guilt who, by drunkenness or a love of speed, endanger their own and others' safety on the road, at sea, or in the air. CCC 2290
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Queen of Heaven

[![Queen of Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day252.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XJfmBfWX_7Y "Queen of Heaven")

##### Day #252 The Queen of Heaven

As we read Jeremiah, the goddess with the title ‚ÄúQueen of Heaven‚Äù comes up a lot. Given the fact that the catholic church gives Mary the title ‚ÄúQueen of heaven‚Äù can be confusing. If you take the title out of context then it can seem confusing. However there are many differences that are very obvious, first Mary is not a goddess she is human. The Queen of heaven spoken about in Jeremiah was an idol, it‚Äôs talking about idol worship.

6 ‚ÄúAs for the word which you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not listen to you. 17 But we will do everything that we have vowed, burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out libations to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no evil. 18 But since we left off burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.‚Äù

The Israelites stopped listening to the word of God that Jeremiah spoke and even stopped burning incense to the idol. They are confused that they are in a poor state because they stopped burning incense to the idol. However, the real reason is that they stopped worshiping the true God of Israel.

When it comes to the title of Queen of heaven for Mary, the first thing is she is not a goddess or an idol. She is just a human being chosen by God to partner with God to bring salvation to the world. She is the daughter of Abba father, the spouse of the Holy Spirit and the mother of Jesus. In the Jewish kingdom, the queen was always the mother, because the kings had many wives.

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.

And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus‚Äô dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1

May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are ‚ÄúI am a handmaid of the Lord‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDo as he says, listen to him‚Äù. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Queen of heaven intercede for us as we try to understand scripture.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 252 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 43:1-3
*When Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all these words of the Lord their God, with which the Lord their God had sent him to them, Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other insolent men said to Jeremiah, ‚ÄúYou are telling a lie. The Lord our God did not send you to say, ‚ÄòDo not go to Egypt to settle there‚Äô; but Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldeans, in order that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.‚Äù*

The Jews did not want to obey God's Word and they were afraid to accuse God's anointed prophet (Jeremiah) directly so they accused Jeremiah's secretary, Baruch, of inciting Jeremiah to give them false messages thus making him a false prophet. This was the only way they could defend their disobedience to God's Word. This was a hypocritical defence on their part because earlier they had taken an oath that they would obey the Lord always, irrespective of whether the message was easy or difficult to follow (Jeremiah 42:5-6).

Like those Jews, sometimes we too twist the wrong to make it look like the right so that we can defend our wrongdoings, and thus we make the good ones look like the bad ones.

Jeremiah 43:13
*He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt.*

An obelisk is a tapering stone pillar, typically having a square or rectangular cross section, set up as a monument or landmark. It was a symbol of the fertility of Egypt.

Jeremiah 44:1-30
A dispute broke out as to why the city of Jerusalem had been defeated in battle (v. 2-3). One side (Jeremiah) declared that it was punishment from Yahweh (God) for the sinners who had worshipped the false Queen of Heaven; while another side (the Israelites) insisted that military defeat occurred because people had stopped worshipping the Queen of Heaven.
The Queen of Heaven was most probably the false goddess Astarte, because the Mesopotamians worshipped the same goddess by offering baked cakes, but they called her ‚ÄúIshtar.‚Äù

It was the idolatry of the people that brought devastation to the nation and their lives, not the cessation of idolatry.

God wants us to worship Him by following a liturgical pattern, which includes offering to Him incense and baked cakes/wafers and pouring out libations to Him as a perpetual statute until the end of time (Exodus 29:38-42). The Israelites were following the same liturgical pattern but to worship the false goddess (v.17 & 19).
God is a loving Father and therefore He provides us with our daily needs irrespective of whether we ask Him or not, just as our earthly father would provide for us even if we were unproductive or disobedient. It is not Satan or the false gods who provide for our survival.

The Israelites connected their earthly pain and gain with the deity they worshipped, but the spiritual reality is opposite.

When we walk on the right path towards God‚Äôs Kingdom, worshipping the living God and obeying all His Commandments, Satan is not happy and therefore he works 24x7 to destroy our souls by destroying our peace and happiness with persecution and/or constant suffering (Revelation 12:17), in and out of our homes, to mislead us into believing that our misfortunes are due to the living God who we worship. But God allows Satan to create those problems and sufferings in our lives to heal us spiritually.
On the other hand, when we walk on the wrong path Satan is very pleased and therefore he will not create any major crisis in our lives so that we are comfortable and happy. He may create small problems in our lives to mislead us into believing that those are the crosses which Jesus wants us to carry and we start believing that we are walking on the right path.

If we focus on our earthly peace and happiness, we end up making wrong decisions and moving forward on the wrong path, which is exactly what Satan wants us to do.
The Israelites were making the same mistake.

The people attributed their prosperity to the queen of Heaven when, in reality, it was God who was blessing them with prosperity.

Sometimes we too are like those people.
We attribute our success to our benefactors on earth and we forget that it is God who makes it possible for them to help us prosper. We go out of our way to give them so much importance that we won't even think twice about cancelling our time with God (Sunday Mass, daily prayers, etc.) to attend to our benefactors and please them.

##### Lamentations of Jeremiah

[![Lamentations of Jeremiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day253.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SDKW8fEUP44 "Lamentations of Jeremiah")

##### Day #253 Let our lamentations be prayers to Christ.

As we read the book of lamentations, we can only imagine the suffering that Baruch experienced. It is not just statements of the bad situations but it‚Äôs more like prayers rising up to God.

‚ÄúSee, Lord, how distressed I am! I am in torment within, and in my heart I am disturbed, for I have been most rebellious. ‚Äù Lam 1:20

When you see your children in need of something and we cannot do anything to help them, it breaks every parent's heart. The children of Israel are destitute and there is no one who can comfort them.

‚ÄúThis is why I weep and my eyes overflow with tears. No one is near to comfort me, no one to restore my spirit. My children are destitute because the enemy has prevailed.‚Äù
Our usual response when we go through suffering is ‚Äúwhy me Lord‚Äù or "What did I do wrong" or we end up focused on the suffering and say "Earlier It was much better", "I was able to do this/that" or "I should not have done this or that" .

Suffering on earth is inevitable and everyone will go through various suffering on earth. We have to train ourselves to accept suffering, to voice our prayers to the Lord, to be able to lament and offer up our sufferings for the salvation of souls. We should not only focus on the why of things or how to get out of suffering, but we have to be able to live in suffering and allow the Holy Spirit to comfort us when we go through difficult times.

Difficult times make us stronger, and the Lord is always with us. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted, so don‚Äôt hesitate to lament and talk to the Lord about those hard things you are facing.

Ps 34: 18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
We should unite our suffering to the suffering of Christ, for the salvation of the world.
12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. 1 Pet 4: 12-13

We should not be surprised that we have suffering in our lives, we should rejoice that we are able to participate in the sufferings of Christ. Even if the suffering seems like a lot, we need to remember that the Lord will not permit anything we cannot handle, and there will always be a way out. So let us accept our sufferings, lament and pray, and be united to Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Judgment of Nations

[![Judgment of Nations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day254.jpg)](https://youtu.be/AHlUaRhb2Mc "Judgment of Nations")

##### Day #254 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing personal opinion.

Have you ever met those kinds of people, who want their voices heard? They don‚Äôt respect the conversation or the person but would cut you off and say only what they want. These are the people who have an opinion and don‚Äôt want to change it at any cost. Having an argument with such people is meaningless for they don‚Äôt want to understand or listen ‚Äì they just want to voice their opinions. They will even twist the truth to win an argument. I‚Äôm sure you have a list of people who fall under this category, and if you find yourself on the list don‚Äôt worry the Holy Spirit will help you.
Here is some practical advice from the book of James.

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. James 1:19

Let us become good listeners, let us not be quick to judge but take time to listen, understand, ask questions, and pray about everything. We should be slow to react, slow to reply and prudent in what we speak.
Words are like bullets, once shot they will never come back.
Take your time to polish every word before you speak.

We are God‚Äôs children and our words carry weight, just as God‚Äôs words bring action even our words can affect positively or negatively. We should be very careful what we say for every word we speak is recorded, we will need to give an account of every careless word we speak.

Matthew 12:36 ‚ÄúBut I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an account for it in the day of judgement.‚Äù

Let us clean up our speech, let us speak words that we are comfortable speaking to God. Let us stop all hate speech, gossip, slander, negative talk, and mean words. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen, let us understand and not just speak our heads off. Let our words be words of love and care, words that will lift up people, and that will build community.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 256 The Lord is a strong tower

The safest place in this world is in the arms of Abba Father. There are so many dangers that we face in our life, right from the time we are born till we die ‚Äì there are dangers on all sides. We can meet with an accident, be part of a shooting on the road, we can get infected by a dangerous virus, can lose our job and livelihood. There are so many things that can go wrong, and bad things can happen to us. There is no need to fear everything around us all that is needed is for us to run to safety, for the Lord is a strong tower those who run to Him will be safe.
The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe. Prov 18:10
The key is "run to God" and to stay in the presence of the Lord, to stay in friendship with God.

You who live in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 2 will say to the Lord, ‚ÄúMy refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.‚Äù 3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence; 4 he will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. 5 You will not fear the terror of the night, or the arrow that flies by day, 6 or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, or the destruction that wastes at noonday. Ps 91:1-6

We need to live in the shelter of God and abide in the shadow of the Almighty. We can find refuge under his wings and God‚Äôs faithfulness will be our shield and buckler. Even if we are faithless the Lord will be faithful and protect us from all harm and danger.
God will put his angels in charge of us and they will patrol around us ‚Äì we will not even dash our foot against the stone, and not even a hair will be lost unless the Lord permits it.

11For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. 12 On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone. Ps 91:11,12

And

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. Ps 34: 7
Let us not fear, as we have angels around us protecting us from all harm and danger.

I met with two accidents in my life and on both occasions ‚Äì I did not get seriously hurt.
I am sure that God placed angels around me and protected me at the time of those accidents. It‚Äôs also important to recognize that we have been saved from many accidents in life even without our own knowledge.
So let us all run to the Lord our strong tower and be safe in His arms.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Choose to Love

[![Choose to Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day257.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JqRK-YQxun8 "Choose to Love")

##### Day 257 We should try to love our extended family

The book of Obadiah is the only 1-chapter book of the Old Testament. One of the main things that come up is the enmity between distant family. Jacob and Esau fought and reconciled ‚Äì however, their descendants grew strangely apart.

For the slaughter and violence done to your brother Jacob,
shame shall cover you,
and you shall be cut off forever.
11 On the day that you stood aside,
on the day that strangers carried off his wealth,
and foreigners entered his gates
and cast lots for Jerusalem,
you too were like one of them.
12 But you should not have gloated over your brother
on the day of his misfortune;
you should not have rejoiced over the people of Judah
on the day of their ruin;
you should not have boasted
on the day of distress. Ob 1:10-12

This could be the challenge most of us are facing as well, loving family ‚Äì especially distant family can get tough. It could be something that happened generations ago and the family ends up not talking to each other or rejoicing when the other family fails. If we have this nature of rejoicing over other people's failures, we need to check our hearts for jealousy, hatred and revenge.

Forgiveness is at the heart of the Christian life and we are able to forgive, but the wounds may be deeper.

For Example: If you grew up listening to your Mom saying that your Dad‚Äôs side of the family is very sly stay away - it could be hard to know the truth as you have been brainwashed.
Or For Example: If your single Dad told you to never reach out to your mom because she does not care about you, it could be hard for one to cross that bridge and understand both sides of the story.

We all have a complex history in our families and may never be able to under the negative wiring we have, however, all hope is not lost. We need to allow the Holy Spirit to heal us and make us better people. We should pray for a just heart, a heart that is pure and guided by the Holy Spirit. A heart that cares and does not judge or rejoice when your enemies fail.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 258 St Joseph our model

We have been journeying with the Israelites for what seems like centuries and millions of people. As we read the Genealogy of Jesus we know a few more names because of our ‚ÄúBible in a year‚Äù experience. We also recognize that not everyone in the genealogy of Jesus is perfect, we read their stories, but God is able to draw a straight line with our crooked lives. We recognize that there are women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. Tamar who bore a child to her father-in-law (re-read day 20), Ruth (The Non-Jew), and Bathsheba(remarried due to King David‚Äôs sins), the ancestors of Jesus were not perfect people ‚Äì however, the Lord makes all things new in Jesus.
Let us take courage when we find ourselves in sin or have bad ancestors or family. We just need to trust the Lord and do good, He will make all things new.
St Joseph was such a just and humble man, that when he was confronted with the decision to be the guardian of the Savior, he felt unworthy and decided to divorce Mary. He was instructed in a dream that it was indeed God‚Äôs plan for him to be the foster father of Jesus.
St Joseph‚Äôs dream would have been confirmed when baby Jesus received gifts from the wise men, the Gold symbolized his Royal Kingly line. The Frankincense revealed that he would be of priest and offer sacrifices, however, the Myrrh would have been the most difficult to understand and it was used to embalm the dead bodies. However, this was just symbolic of His death and resurrection. It must have been hard being baby Jesus‚Äô parents, that‚Äôs why Mary pondered all these things in her heart.
Joseph became "the savior of the savior" when we had to flee with the Holy Family to Egypt. He protected that family in Egypt and brought them safely back when Herod died. St Joseph is given the title "the terror of demons" because even when he sleeps he communicates with God in dreams.
Let us learn from St Joseph to be humble, discerning, and docile to the will of God. Dream like St Joseph.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 258 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 1:1-17
The genealogy of Jesus has Jews and gentiles which means it needs the unity of Jews and gentiles to birth the complete Body of Christ, the Kingdom of God.
By linking Jesus to Abraham through David, Matthew wants to show his Jewish audience that Jesus is the royal Messiah, the divine Son of the promise.
David is spelt DVD in Hebrew, and the numerical value is 14 ( D=4, V=6). That is why Matthew has shown the ancestry of Jesus to Joseph in groups of 14.
The Gospel according to Matthew was written for the Jews.

Matthew mentions four women in the genealogy.
All four women were not Jews. They were either gentiles or associated with gentiles.
Tamar and Rahab were Canaanites, Ruth was a Moabite, the tribe with which God had forbidden the Israelites from intermarrying, and Bathsheba had been married to a Hittite before David.
Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba were not very clean in character.
Tamar‚Äôs two sons were conceived through an illicit relation with Judah;
Rahab was running an establishment of ill repute.
Bathsheba had an adulterous relation with King David.

The people of the Judah tribe were also descendants of these same four women.
Matthew was preparing the Jews to receive a Saviour who was criticized for hanging around with gentiles and sinners because they themselves were the descendants of gentiles and sinful people. They were also the descendants of illicit relations.
Matthew also shows that Jesus came to redeem not only the Jews but also the gentiles.
Matthew also shows that Jesus was the rightful heir to the Davidic throne as Joseph‚Äôs legal son (Luke 2:21), and Mary‚Äôs biological son (Romans 1:3).

Matthew begins his genealogy from Abraham who was the Father of Judaism

The first century Jews believed that Solomon was the chosen Messiah for Israel.
Therefore, after the Resurrection of Jesus there were conflicts within Jewish families where some Jews in the family accepted Jesus and the others did not.
Matthew, being aware of the situation around him, split the genealogy of Jesus to show the Jews that if Solomon could be accepted as the Messiah even though he was an offspring of an adultrous affair, and a descendant of non-Jewish women, of which two were women of ill repute, and then why couldn't Jesus, who was born of a virgin mother, be accepted as the Messiah?

Matthew 1:20
*‚ÄúJoseph son of David.‚Äù*
Joseph's father was Jacob, not David, but the angel was reminding Joseph of his royal lineage, his dynastic line, because all descendants of David were generally referred to as ‚Äúsons and daughters of David.‚Äù
The angel was reminding Joseph that the Messiah was going to be from the lineage of David, and since Joseph was a descendant of David, he fitted the role as father of the Messiah.

Matthew 1:21
*‚ÄúYou are to name Him Jesus."*
The one who gives the name is the owner or controller of the recipient, just as God named the light ‚Äúday‚Äù and darkness ‚Äúnight‚Äù (Genesis 1:5), the dome ‚Äúsky‚Äù (Genesis 1:8), the dry land ‚Äúearth‚Äù (Genesis 1:10), etc., and just as Adam named all the living creatures (Genesis 2:19-20).
Giving Joseph the authority to name Jesus meant giving Joseph the authority to be the one who controls Jesus, the Son of God, and yet Joseph never misused his authority.

Matthew 1:24-25
*When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; he took her into his home as his wife and he had no marital relations with her until she bore a son.*
Matthew‚Äôs emphasis was on the virgin birth which was according to the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:22-23). Matthew wrote for a Jewish audience and therefore he wanted to make it known that the baby was purely from the Holy Spirit and not from Joseph.

Accepting a pregnant woman as his wife would bring Joseph a lot of shame and scorn because it would now be believed that he was the man who fathered the child before marriage, which means that Joseph had broken the law. But Joseph was willing to sacrifice his respect to save Mary.
This is where Jesus learnt about sacrificial love.

*About Joseph.*
Joseph was called a righteous man because he was obedient to the Will of God. He carried out his duties as a father and a spouse perfectly.
Joseph is mostly painted as an old man because most people find it hard to believe that a young man could remain chaste inspite of being married to a pretty young woman.
If we cannot agree that Joseph was a young man, then we do not know what true sacrificial love is. That is where Jesus got His values from.
Joseph knew how to master his desires, which is why he is called "righteous."
Joseph reminds us that we can do God's work even when we are working silently in the background.

Matthew 2:12
*Then they returned to their country by another road because God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.*
The magi were experts in interpreting dreams so they knew exactly what the dream meant and how important it was. Also, they had seen how disturbed Herod was when he heard the news of the new king.

What can we learn from the magi ?

1. They were men who read and believed the Word of God.
2. They started on a journey looking for Jesus.
3. They recognized the kingship and priesthood of the Messiah and therefore presented him with the appropriate gifts, the best of what they had.
4. They humbled themselves to worship Jesus inspite of their high position in society.
5. They obeyed God and not men.
   They were truly wise men.
   The magi were not only seekers, but, most importantly, they were finders.
   They did not stop looking for Jesus until they found Him and the star led the wise men to Jesus.
   Let us become like this special star, and guide many people to Jesus.
   Like the wise men, let us not stop looking for Jesus until we find Him.

Matthew 3:9
*‚ÄúDo not presume to say to yourselves, ‚ÄòWe have Abraham as our ancestor‚Äô; for I tell you, God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.‚Äù*
Our God who is leading His Kingdom on earth (His Church) today, is able to raise priests and missionaries from the stones of the Cathedral / Church.
Some years ago we didn‚Äôt even imagine that the Word of God would be preached through different online platforms, which is now made available to millions of God‚Äôs children. God gave us the social media well in advance before Covid hit the globe. God is magnificently guiding the evangelization ministry through social media, creating new opportunities to reach people.
Having the DNA of Abraham is not a guarantee for salvation and neither is Baptism.

Matthew 3:13-17
*Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything. During His baptism Jesus (the sinless man) was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give Him the means by which He could impart to us the Holy Spirit which we were lacking in due to original sin, and He gives the Holy Spirit to us through our Baptism.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.
God always begins a new creation with water and Spirit, a symbol of baptism (Genesis 1:2; Genesis 8:10-11; Exodus 14:22).
Likewise Jesus started the new creation with His baptism.

*And a voice from heaven said, ‚ÄúThis is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.‚Äù*
God is very pleased, not only when Jesus was baptized, but also when any human is baptized. Baptism is a gift from God, given with love, to make us members of His family and it makes Him very happy whenever a human accepts His gift, just as it makes us happy when someone accepts our gift given with love.

Matthew 4:1-11
Satan tried to tempt Jesus because Satan wanted Jesus to abandon His mission so that humanity would be trapped in sin forever.
If Satan didn't spare the Son of God, then we have no reason to believe that Satan will spare us.

Satan promised to return to Jesus all creation which belongs to Jesus but without suffering.
Satan tempts humanity with this offer of wealth, comfort and pleasure without suffering, even today.

Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly and obey God's Commandments, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us.

Jesus was alone in the wilderness when the devil attacked Him.
The devil's strongest instrument is our isolation from family. He therefore starts by breaking families with divorce, fights for possessions, etc. and then starts working on attacking each soul separately.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.
Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc. How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test. If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Temptations are God‚Äôs way of training us for spiritual warfare.
A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.
Similarly, we cannot fight the spiritual enemy (Satan) by leading comfortable lives.

To be able to win a physical battle, a soldier of the country has to undergo constant physical training and practice of the use of physical weapons.
Similarly, to be able to win a spiritual battle, a soldier of Christ must undergo constant spiritual training to stay out of sin with daily prayer, reading the Word of God, regular repentance and reception of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist (Communion), etc. and practice the use of spiritual weapons (peace, love, understanding, patience, humility, kindness, generosity, etc.).

Satan offered 3 shortcuts to Jesus to increase the number of His followers.
*The first shortcut:*
*The tempter came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.‚Äù*
In other words, do whatever you think is right in your eyes; no rules, forget duty, only remember your rights and your desires, etc.

*The second shortcut:*
*Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the pinnacle of the temple, saying to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down;*
In other words, humans love excitement and surprises. They love anything that makes them say "vow" even if they forget it after a week. So perform some magic here and there to keep them entertained and they will follow you.

*The third shortcut:*
*Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor; and he said to him, ‚ÄúAll these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.‚Äù*
In other words, Theology is boring. It only talks about suffering. It encourages living in poverty. It tells you not to retaliate when someone insults or humiliates you. So forget theology and get involved in politics in whichever field you may be, whether in school, at work, in a religious community, or anywhere else, and do whatever it takes to reach the top and have power in your hands, even if you have to hurt some people along the way.

What shortcuts do we take in our lives to increase the number of our likes, followers, viewers and subscribers?

Matthew 4:19
*I will make you fishers of men.*
Why only fishers and not hunters?
Jesus called His first disciples ‚Äúfishers‚Äù because He wanted them to first focus on finding the Israelites who were scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing. The gentiles/lost tribes, living in the woodlands, would be found later by the ‚Äúhunters‚Äù (Jeremiah 16:16). After His resurrection Jesus sent Saul/Paul on the mission to bring the gentiles/lost tribes into the Church.

##### The Sermon on the Mount

[![The Sermon on the Mount](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day259.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fXSy0DsEnak "The Sermon on the Mount")

##### Day 259 Do not be anxious, isn‚Äôt life more than food and clothes

At the start of the sermon on the mount, Jesus sets the scene when he goes up the mountain and sits down. In the OT going up the mountain was almost always an indication of a God experience ‚Äì here the people meet God in the person of Jesus Christ. In the OT the teachers would sit down to teach ‚Äì unlike in our modern culture where they stand up to preach, so when Jesus sat down, they know He will be teaching. Jesus is the new Moses who gives us the new law of love. Moses brought the ten commandments written on stone tablets and Jesus was the word of God himself - the word written on our hearts ‚Äì he spoke those beautiful beatitudes ‚Äì not just the law but the life ‚Äì Jesus tells us what we need to do to be happy.
One thing that steels happiness is anxiety. We are a generation that is worried and anxious about too many things. We are constantly thinking about tomorrow, what we will eat and what we wear. It seems that we are overly concerned about earthly matters and achievements. We seem to forget the more important things like our soul and our prayer life.
The Lord reminds us that He is in control of our lives, He feeds us just as He feeds the birds of the air that are there today and gone tomorrow. Would not the Lord cloth us, He would cloths the lilies of the field.
25 ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your span of life?28 And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you‚Äîyou of little faith?
31 Therefore do not worry, saying, ‚ÄòWhat will we eat?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat will we drink?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhat will we wear?‚Äô 32 For it is the Gentiles who strive for all these things; and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But strive first for the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
34 ‚ÄúSo do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring worries of its own. Today‚Äôs trouble is enough for today.
Mat 6:25-34
The best way to rid ourselves of anxiety would be to know our relationship with God. He is a Good Father who takes care of his children.
9 Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone? 10 Or if the child asks for a fish, will give a snake? 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Let us shun all our anxiety because we are children of Abba Father who cares for us. In Jesus we have this beautiful relationship ‚Äì we are made bold enough to cry out ‚ÄúAbba Father‚Äù.
Our father in heaven will supply every need of ours, let us not forget to pray. We will receive our daily bread.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### DAY 259 By Sheila

Matthew: ln Matthew we learn to love our enemies those whom we consider unworthy of our love and affection. It is precisely in loving, the love of God surpasses way beyond human norms of acceptability. The Father's Love is given to the good and the unpleasant and is humbling. God never withdraws His Love for us just because we did something that is not right.

The Our Father we say is To God, Our Father whom we can relate to, with sheer intimacy, veering away from pagan ways of praying. Jesus wants us to come to God as a child approaches his father, a whole new way experience of Divine nearness to burst out our hearts desires.

```text
Don't worry, don't be anxious and don't be too preoccupied. Set our hearts on the Kingdom of God and all other things will be given.

Sadly, in our faith life, many tend to despise the things which require time. We have become so impatient whenever God seems to delay His response to our prayers. We are accustomed to instant life, an easy way and the urgency to wait. Thus lost the thrill of choosing the Narrow Gate which requires careful discernment, endurance and let God be God.
```

Proverbs: therefore teaches us to choose life, love, whose price is far above and encourages devotion and perseverance with a deeper loyalty.

##### BIAY Day 259 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 5:1-12
Jesus is uniquely qualified to answer what happiness is because, he made us with His divine nature, so he knows what will fulfill us; and with His human nature he experienced the most perfect happiness possible, so we can follow him to the same destination.
At the dawn of our race, there was a great shipwreck, and among the things that went down with the ship was the human heart. So damaged was the human heart by the wound of original sin that its full potential for happiness and love remained largely unknown until Jesus came with the instruction manual for the human heart, namely, ‚Äúthe Beatitudes.‚Äù

While men were vainly seeking happiness in wealth, Jesus came with the instruction ‚Äúblessed are the poor in spirit.‚Äù
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the fleeting pleasures of the emotions, Jesus came with the instruction ‚Äúblessed are those who mourn.‚Äù
While men were vainly seeking happiness in the esteem of men, Jesus came with the instruction ‚Äúblessed are you when men reproach you and persecute you.‚Äù
Truly, the human heart is counterintuitive, and without Jesus we could not have found happiness on our own. We were like flies vainly seeking the light of the sun through a windowpane when the way out was an open door through the darkness right behind us.

In this sermon Jesus teaches us how to live a true Christian life.

In the old Covenant, the righteous people were blessed with material wealth and prosperity.
In the new Covenant, the righteous people may or may not be blessed with prosperity in this life but they will definitely be blessed with prosperity in Heaven if they take up their cross and endure through their suffering to the end (Matthew 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23).

Jesus showed us the meaning of the beatitudes by living His life in accordance with His teaching. The beatitudes are a spiritual profile of Jesus Himself. He wants us to follow His example.
The devil has a million ways to drag us into his kingdom. Jesus wants us to be alert to sin in everything we do and say.

Matthew 5:3
The poor in spirit are those who are humble, and depend upon God completely for everything good, bodily and spiritual. They have three qualities in common:

> > they all trust in God to provide for their needs;
> > they are all detached from wealth or honor; and
> > they all love God more than wealth or honor.

Matthew 5:16
The sanctity of the world depends totally on the sanctity and obedience of Christians to the teachings of Christ, and not so much on the sanctity of non-Christians who have not heard of Jesus but are leading holy lives.
And when the world is sanctified, God is glorified.
Jesus did not focus only on maintaining the sanctity of His soul. While maintaining the sanctity of His soul, Jesus focused on bringing others to God.
We too must do the same.
If we live our Christian lives in a state of grace at all times, then the world will be sanctified and God will be glorified because the percentage of faithful Christians will be far greater than the percentage of non-believers.

Jesus came to bring light to the world.
As followers of Christ we must use the scriptures to dispel our own darkness first and then the darkness in others.
If we have any confusion we can always ask the Lord for His help.

Like the Olympic Torch bearers, God required the Patriarchs to carry His light through thousands of years across the world.
Like the Patriarchs, we too can become torch bearers and carry the light of Christ to the world around us. We don't need to run several miles like the Olympics Torch bearers. We can do it from where we are.

We don't do good works to gain merits.
We must do good works because good works are part of God‚Äôs plan for salvation of the entire world and God uses His children to accomplish His divine plan.
When we help or pray for those in need we become the instruments through whom God works. We can enter into God's divine plan for salvation through prayer, good works or suffering.

Matthew 5:17
The old law was not perfect because it could not purify the souls of the people.
‚ÄúHe abolished the old (sacrifice) in order to establish the new (sacrifice)‚Äù (Hebrews 10:9).
By His life, death and resurrection, Jesus fulfilled the shadows of the old Religious Law and gives Himself to us through the sacraments to purify our souls.

Matthew 5:20
Jesus was not speaking against the scribes and Pharisees.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees was real but it was earthly, human and natural, and it was based on the Mosaic Law.
The righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees could only discipline God's people to make them good citizens of the earthly Jerusalem. It could not purify their conscience/souls. But the Law of Christ makes us saints of the heavenly Jerusalem because it purifies our conscience/souls through the sacraments.
Therefore, as a new Covenant people, our righteousness must go beyond the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, not against it.

Matthew 5:21-22
The old law said ‚Äúdo not kill‚Äù (Exodus 20:13).
But Jesus did not just forbid murder. Murder was already forbidden in the old law. Jesus forbade us from using harsh or insulting words when speaking to others so that our anger does not progress to hatred, hatred does not progress to revenge, and revenge does not progress to murder. Jesus wants us to nip the evil in the bud.
It is not wrong to be angry when someone has offended us but we must not allow our anger to progress to sinful words and actions.

Matthew 5:23-24
Before offering our gift / sacrifice at the Altar, Jesus wants us to make peace with everyone around us and change our anger, hatred, enmity into love because we cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbor (everyone around us).
If we have anger, hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness against anyone then we cannot have union with the Lord at the Altar and all our fasting, almsgiving, prayer, etc. is all a waste.

Matthew 5: 27-32
In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church. Physical adultery and divorce are symbols of spiritual adultery and divorce.
In a spiritually adulterous relation we (the Church) abandon our spouse (Jesus) and join with our lover (Satan) when we commit mortal sins. Therefore, Jesus forbade adultery and divorce.

Matthew 5:38-39
*‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.‚Äô But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also;‚Äù*
If God had allowed the ancient form of justice to continue till the end of time then, at the speed with which violence is increasing in today‚Äôs world, by the end of time two thirds of humanity would probably have no eyes and teeth.
Jesus softened the law by introducing forgiveness because retaliation doesn't create peace and security around us.

Development of morality in salvation history:
After the fall of man, Cain could avenge 7 times.
Moses could avenge equal times (an eye for an eye).
Prophets preached that mercy was as important as justice.
Jesus said, "love your enemies; forget vengeance and forgive 70 times seven; leave the vengeance to God. If enemy repents then God will forgive them too."

Due to man‚Äôs sinful nature, it took thousands of years for God to forbid retaliation totally and bring humanity down to this level.

Matthew 6:1-2
Hypocrites are not only those who make a public show of their good deeds.
When we profess our faith in Christ but don‚Äôt live our lives like Christ then we are hypocrites.
When we pray The Lord‚Äôs Prayer on one side, and live with a grudge against our offenders and speak ill about them on the other side, then we are hypocrites.

Matthew 6:5
Synagogues were places where the Law was explained to the people (Acts 13:13-16) and they were taught how to apply it to themselves in their daily lives. They also sang the psalms. The Jews never prayed or worshipped God in the Synagogues. Worship was strictly reserved to be only in the official Temple where the sacrifice was offered (John 4:20). The hypocrites prayed on the streets and in the Synagogues because those were the places where there were crowds of people and the hypocrites wanted people to see them praying.

There is no harm in praying at home with our families but additionally Jesus wants us to spend time with God in solitude, every day, just as He did. There is also no harm in gathering with people outside homes to pray as long as we are not making a show of it for personal gain.

Matthew 6:6
Prayer is not about giving God information. It is an activity he wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.
We don't pray to God to change His mind to do our will.
We pray to God to change our mind to do His Will.
By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

Matthew 6:7-8
Jesus was condemning the heathen's/pagan's repetitive prayers because :

1. their prayers were not made to the living God.
2. their prayers did not include praise and thanksgiving to the living God.
3. their prayers did not have any repentance and request for forgiveness.
   Repetitive prayers made to the living God are not condemned by God (Daniel 3:25-45; Daniel 3:51-90; Psalm 118:1-4; Psalm 136:1-26; Matthew 26:44).
   Our prayers to the living God must always begin with praise, thanksgiving for blessings received and repentance for sins committed. This may or may not be followed by our petitions.

Matthew 6:10
Jesus taught us to pray, ‚ÄúMay Thy Kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done‚Äù,
But how can God's Kingdom (Heaven) come down on earth if we, Christians, remain silent and worry about our own comfort and reputation when we see people around us doing sinful things?

Matthew 6:24
*You cannot serve two masters.*
God does not want our divided attention, that is, 50% with the Church and 50% with the world. He wants us to surrender ourselves to Him totally, which is 100%.

Matthew 6:33
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers, unless we are in a critical condition and cannot pray).
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God‚Äôs Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Matthew 7:1-5
When we remove the log from our eye, we will notice that what was in our brother's eye was only a splinter. It is not wrong to hate someone else's sins and expect them to correct themselves. But it is definitely wrong if we are only focusing on correcting others and not correcting our own errors. Our holiness must not be in comparison with other humans. Our holiness must be in comparison with Jesus, which no human can surpass but we must try to get as closer to Him, in holiness, as possible.

Matthew 7:21-23
*‚ÄúNot everyone who says to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.*
What is the will of our Father in heaven?
God's Will is that we must worship Him the way He wants us to and to obey all the teachings of Christ which are:
A) repentance (Luke 24:47);
B) caring for others, specially the poor and needy (Matthew 9:13);
C) serving God by serving others (Matthew 20:26-28).

*On that day many will say to me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many deeds of power in your name?‚Äô Then I will declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers.‚Äô*
Those people had been given the power to prophesy and perform miracles, and yet they were not allowed to enter Heaven.

That is because the Holy Spirit gives us two types of graces:
(1) charismatic or natural grace, and;
(2) sanctifying grace.
Sanctifying grace is the saving grace (Ephesians 2:8) and those who do not have this grace when they die are the ones whom Jesus says He will reject, even though the Lord may have done many good works through them through their charismatic or natural grace.
We must therefore ensure that we are in a state of grace at all times.

Matthew 7:21
*Faith and works.*
Works are not meant to earn our way to Heaven.
Every Christian has an obligation to allow the Holy Spirit in them to do good works for the growth of the Church and the salvation of the world thus becoming the salt and light of the world while they make sure they maintain their own holiness.

Matthew 7:24-25
*‚ÄúEveryone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on rock.*
There will definitely be storms in the life of a Christian because our faith must be tested. But the question to ask is not "will there be a storm in my life?" The question to ask is "when the storm hits my life, will I be spiritually ready for it?"

##### Carrying the Cross

[![Carrying the Cross](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day260.jpg)](https://youtu.be/j6PaYtQRu34 "Carrying the Cross")

##### Day 260 Faith, Healing, and carrying our cross

We read multiple healings in today‚Äôs Gospel of Matthew, one thing that is most common in all of the healings is faith. The best example is that of the centurion, even though he was not a Jew or a person who we can expect faith from, he did set the best example. He used a real-life example of how his soldier listened to every command, that just a word from Jesus would cure his servant. This is such a great revelation, it was eye-opening and even got Jesus' attention, Jesus praised the centurion's faith.
5 When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, appealing to him 6 and saying, ‚ÄúLord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.‚Äù 7 And he said to him, ‚ÄúI will come and cure him.‚Äù 8 The centurion answered, ‚ÄúLord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only speak the word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô and he goes, and to another, ‚ÄòCome,‚Äô and he comes, and to my slave, ‚ÄòDo this,‚Äô and the slave does it.‚Äù 10 When Jesus heard him, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, in no one in Israel have I found such faith. 11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 12 while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù 13 And to the centurion Jesus said, ‚ÄúGo; let it be done for you according to your faith.‚Äù And the servant was healed in that hour. Mat 8:5-13
Jesus said that in all of Israel he never found faith like that of the centurion. The centurion recognized the divinity of Jesus. That is why we use this as the prayer before communion. When we pray ‚ÄúLord I am not worthy to receive you only say the words and I shall be healed‚Äù ‚Äì we are making a prayer of faith ‚Äì a prayer that recognizes the divinity in the Eucharist. It is not a piece of bread that we consume, but Jesus‚Äôs body ‚Äì Jesus enters the door of our bodies, the mouth. When Jesus comes into our hearts we are healed ‚Äì physically, mentally and spiritually.
Although receiving healing is great and we need to have faith for it. The other thing that we need faith for is the cross, sometimes God‚Äôs will is not to heal us immediately but permit us to suffer, which will lead us closer to God. Just like healing, even the cross needs faith. We cannot carry the cross without faith, we have to deny ourselves everyday pickup our cross, and follow Him, all of this needs faith. If we only want healing and no cross we are not worthy of the Kingdom of God.
34 ‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
35 For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and one‚Äôs foes will be members of one‚Äôs own household.
37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38 and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it. Mat 10:34-39
Sometimes to follow Jesus we may have to pay the ultimate price of going against our family/loved ones. Our friendship with Jesus should have priority ‚Äì nothing or no one should prevent us from following the Lord. No one should prevent us from loving our Lord and loving our neighbor. Our family may something not like that we spend time in prayer or may call it a waste of time. The constant nagging of family members can dampen our spirits, but we should not give up, we should pick up our cross daily and follow Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 260 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 8:1-4
Leprosy was a symbol of sin. Leprosy separated the man from his community until he came to Jesus and asked to be healed.

If we have any sins (anger, hatred, envy, etc.) which have separated us from our community or family or relatives, let us go to Jesus today and ask Him to forgive us and heal our souls so that we can reconcile with the ones whom we have been separated from.

*And then a leper approached, did him homage, and said, ‚ÄúLord, if you wish, you can make me clean.‚Äù*
The man believed that Jesus could heal him, but he surrendered himself to the Will of the Lord because he didn't know what the Lord‚Äôs Will was.

During the agony in the garden, Jesus also believed that God the Father could save Him from the torture He was to go through during His passion, but He surrendered himself to the Will of the Father.

When we pray, we ask the Lord for whatever we want because we believe that He can give it to us, but our prayers must always end with our surrender to the Will of the Lord.

*He stretched out his hand, touched him, and said, ‚ÄúI will do it. Be made clean.‚Äù*
By touching the leper Jesus bridged the gap between the holy and the unclean. In the new Covenant all unclean people would be able to worship God along with the clean ones. The climax was when the Temple curtain was torn in two at the death of Jesus (Mark 15:38).

The touch was, however, only symbolic. The actual healing took place because of God‚Äôs Will and the man‚Äôs faith. God doesn't have to touch someone to heal the person. His Will is sufficient.

*".... but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the gift which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.‚Äù*
Leprosy was a shadow of sin and the leper was a shadow of all sinners.
God allowed the people to be struck with leprosy, whenever they disobeyed Him, to show them how sin damages the soul.

The Israelites were consecrated to belong to God's family. A leper had to be isolated from God‚Äôs family and was also not allowed to enter the Temple until the leprosy was healed. Quarantine from the community and Temple was to show how sin separates us from God and His heavenly family and thereby brings suffering into our lives.
Like leprosy, a sinful life also stops us from worshipping God.

Like the unclean man, when we show ourselves to the priest in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, we first go down on our knees to humble ourselves, then we confess our sins to the Lord through the Priest.
Healing the leper was a shadow of the priest giving us absolution, after forgiving us our sins, to renew the broken Covenant.

Matthew 8:5-7
*A centurion came to Jesus, and said, ‚ÄúLord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress.‚Äù And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI will come and cure him.‚Äù*
Inspite of knowing fully well that the centurion belonged to the occupation troops of the enemy camp, Jesus did not misuse the centurion's weak moment to make an ungodly deal with him. Jesus did not tell the centurion that He would heal the man's servant if he and his troops left their territory. On the contrary, Jesus, out of compassion, humbled Himself to go all the way to the centurion's house to heal the sick servant.
Likewise, if our enemy is in distress, we must forget our differences and reach out to them and help them without any condition.

Matthew 8:11-12
*I tell you, many will come from east and west and will eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the heirs of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äù*
The kingdom of Heaven will ultimately be occupied by the gentiles who convert to the faith, more than the Jews who became Kingdom members by natural descent, because most of the Jews rejected Christ.

But that does not mean all Christians will go to Heaven.
The same also applies to the Christians who take the Kingdom for granted and choose to separate themselves from Christ with their mortal sins, thus living in disobedience to God and losing their heavenly inheritance.

Matthew 8:15
*Now Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law lay sick in bed with a fever. They immediately told Jesus about her. He approached her, took her by her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them.*
The healing which Jesus brings is meant for serving others. Therefore, if Jesus has healed us of any illness (physical, spiritual, emotional, etc.), it is because He wants us to start serving others.
What Jesus has done for Simon‚Äôs mother-in-law, He has done for all humanity; He has raised all of us who lay dead through our sins (Ephesians 2:5).

Matthew 8:20
*And Jesus said to him, ‚Äúfoxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.‚Äù*
Jesus has nowhere to rest because His resting place is in our hearts.

Matthew 8:23-27
This was a foreshadow of the Church.
Likewise there will be many violent storms for the Church on the celestial journey and maybe the boat will be capsized many times due to persecutions, but if we, the sailors/followers obey God‚Äôs commandments and have faith that Jesus will always be with us to the end then we will not drown.
When God is with us it doesn't mean that we will sail in a boat with no storms. It means that we have a boat which no storm can sink.

If we look at the physical side of the scene, it seems like Jesus was asleep and the disciples were awake.
But if we look at the spiritual side of the scene, Jesus was spiritually awake and the disciples were spiritually asleep.
Jesus knew that God the Father is aware of everything that happens on earth and that God is in control. God just wants us to focus on Him and trust in Him. But the disciples forgot that God (Jesus) was right beside them.
Like the disciples, when we are going through a crisis we too feel that God is asleep.

Matthew 8:28-34
Jesus and the disciples were faced with a storm at sea on their way to Gadara (Matthew 8:23-27). Satan knew that Jesus was going to release the demons from the possessed man at Gadara. That is why Satan caused a storm at sea so that Jesus and his disciples would either be drowned or they would be filled with so much fear that they would turn and go back. But Jesus always placed His trust in God so He was not afraid.

When God has a special plan for our lives, Satan always tries to throw rocks and thorns on our path to discourage and stop us from carrying out God‚Äôs plan because he knows that every baptized child has been chosen by God for a divine purpose.

The people told Jesus to leave because they were more concerned about their material loss than their spiritual loss. They chose the pigs over Jesus.

The pigs were considered unclean and were therefore a symbol of a materialistic / sinful way of life in this world which is controlled by demons. And those people were a shadow of those who choose a materialistic life controlled by demons instead of a spiritual life led by Jesus. Such people will meet with their ultimate destruction.

Matthew 9:1-8
The paralytic's friends knew what he needed and they knew they couldn't heal him themselves, so, inspite of the obstacles, they brought him to Jesus.

When we know our friends are spiritually paralyzed (going away from God) it is our obligation to try our best to bring them back to God, irrespective of the difficulties and obstacles we may face. We must not allow anyone's criticism, humiliation, negative opinion, etc. to stand in our way.

There‚Äôs no mention of whether the sick man had faith in Jesus or not, but Jesus healed the sick man because the sick man‚Äôs friends had faith in Jesus.
God will answer our prayers even if we pray for the spiritual healing of those who don‚Äôt have faith in Him.

The man came for one miracle but Jesus noticed the need for two (physical and spiritual).

Matthew 9:15
*The days will come when the Bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.‚Äù*
Our bridegroom is taken away from us whenever we betray Him with our mortal sins because our sins destroy the divine life within us.

That is why we observe one hour fasting before Mass until we receive our bridegroom (Communion).

Matthew 9:18-26
This passage is about two miracles where Jesus heals a matured woman and a little girl. The common things about both miracles were that both recipients were females in different age groups, both had a connection with the number 12, and both miracles were performed by Jesus due to someone‚Äôs faith in His power.
When the woman was healed, Jairus‚Äôs daughter died.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God‚Äôs daughter for 12 years.

If we are God‚Äôs children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during worship.

The woman was the only one of a multitude to barely touch the hem of Jesus‚Äôs garment, yet she alone was healed.

Many people stand in the long queues for Holy Communion, like that crowd bumping into Jesus, but like that woman, very few of them receive the Body of Christ (Communion) with true faith in Him.
Let us be among those few ones who receive the Lord into our hearts with true faith.

Matthew 9:27-31
This miracle was a type of the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.

*The blind man went to Jesus and asked Him for mercy.*
We can receive mercy only if we go to Jesus with humility during Confession and Mass, and ask for it.

*When Jesus touched the man he received physical sight.*
When we receive the sacraments Jesus touches us and gives us the Holy Spirit to open our spiritual eyes to perceive the spiritual reality, thus taking away the blindness which covered our eyes due to sin.

*The man was able to see only because he believed.*
Similarly, spiritual healing through the sacraments will happen only if we believe that God‚Äôs grace flows through the sacraments.

Matthew 9:32-33
*After they had gone away, a demoniac who was mute was brought to him. And when the demon had been cast out, the one who had been mute, spoke;*
Today, the mute are those of us who have a tongue but do not discuss or spread the Word of God because the evil spirit inside us makes us feel embarrassed and ashamed when we do so.
Like the mute man, let us go to Jesus and ask Him to release our tongue so that we may have the courage to spread the Gospel.

Matthew 9:36
*When Jesus saw the crowds, His heart was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.*
Are our hearts moved with compassion for the less fortunate ones?
If we are moved, then do we make any attempt to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, etc., as Jesus commanded us to (Matthew 25:34-36)?

Matthew 10:1-4
Jesus (the new Solomon) and His 12 apostles, of which Peter was chosen to oversee them, were foreshadowed, in the old Covenant, by King Solomon and His 12 governors/chief ministers and one Prime Minister.

Matthew 10:4
*Why did Jesus choose Judas Iscariot to be his apostle?*
To show us that :

1. all bishops and priests are not saints.
2. there is a Judas in all of us. When we betray Jesus with our sins we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified.
3. God can call anyone to be a priest, the good ones as well as the bad ones.
4. on the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front. Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers).
5. whatever Satan may do to destroy the Church through his Judases, from inside (through scandals, corruption, etc.) and from outside (through persecutions), the Church (the saints) will ultimately reach the promised land (Heaven).

Matthew 10:7-8
*As you go, proclaim the good news, ‚ÄòThe kingdom of heaven has come near.‚Äô Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons.*
The Gospel is the good news because it has overcome the bad news but for most people the Gospel is just "news" because they haven't focused on the bad news.
The bad news is that, due to the weakness of our souls, we are in captivity of the enemy (Satan and his minions) most of the time through the world, the flesh and the devil (1 John 1:8). Jesus identified the devil as the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) and Satan‚Äôs goods are we humans. Most of the time Satan and his minions succeed in getting humans to do what they know they shouldn't do, however big or small it may be, because sin is a power. At other times Satan succeeds in tricking humans into believing his half truths and his new ideologies, etc. Satan has a million ways to deceive humans. That is why Michael and his angels are constantly at battle with the evil spirits (Revelation 12:7-11), both types of spirits being represented by humans on earth.

We may not be having the power to cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons physically or dramatically but with our love, generosity, kindness, etc. we can give new life to the people who have lost hope, we can help the sick and the lepers by attending to their needs, and we can help those who live in darkness to get rid of the demons in their lives (anger, hatred, revenge, greed, selfishness, loneliness, addictions, cruelty, etc.) who are holding them in bondage.

By these physical miracles Jesus was demonstrating how He was going to free us of our spiritual suffering through the sacraments and how the power of God works.
Jesus didn't come to earth to abolish evil and heal us of our physical suffering. He came to heal us of our spiritual suffering (sin) which is the cause of our physical suffering and which thwarts us in our vocation as God‚Äôs children.

Matthew 10:28
"Fear of the Lord" is not about being afraid of God like we would be in the case of a tyrant. "Fear of the Lord" is fear of losing Him and therefore we choose to follow Him. We must ask the Lord to give us the grace to stay close to Him always.
When we fear the Lord we will make sure that whatever we do we will do it to please Him, just as we would do to the one we love.

Matthew 10:31
*Do not be afraid.*
Whenever we face a crisis fear grips our hearts because we have a fallen human nature, and the devil does everything he can to install fear in our hearts so that we despair and seek immediate solutions even if they are ungodly.

Jesus tells us not to fear because if God is truly in our hearts then we will leave all our worries in His hands trusting that He will eventually bring us out of the storm even if we get injured on the way out.

Matthew 10:39
*Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.*
Those who fear death are the ones who die only once. Those who live for Christ are the ones who die a thousand deaths before they leave this world.

Whoever focuses on nourishing and saving his natural life will eventually lose his natural life as well as his eternal life because natural life is temporary and he has not prepared himself for his eternal life.

On the other hand, whoever has lost his natural life (maybe because of persecutions) because he was faithfully following Jesus, will receive eternal life because he knew which life was more important and he spent his time on earth preparing himself for eternal life, therefore he was not afraid of losing his natural life.

Matthew 10:40
Like the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:8-35), Jesus wants us to welcome priests in our homes because, by their apostolic ordination, when we welcome them we welcome Jesus and God the Father into our homes.

##### DAY 260. By Sheila

Matthew: The Lord has remembered his Mercy. "Oh Lord I am not worthy to receive You but only say the Word and I shall be healed." We often say these words right before we take Communion. What do they mean? Essentially, it is an expression of deep faith. Faith is fundamentally an adherence to the Person of Jesus, whose Words bring Life and Healing. Our faith ought to go way beyond our assent to a body of doctrinal teaching but to a relationship with the One who comes to us as a Gift to be taken, Jesus. He is God's Gift, who bore our infirmities and took on Himself, our diseases. Each time, we receive Jesus, we commit to adhere to both, His Message and His Person.
We go on to live in a World that puts premium in having things at the tip of our fingers. We want to have 'control' over the circumstances of our life. We are no strangers of fear but fear is neither good nor bad. The things we are afraid of pushes us to shout, 'Lord save us! We are lost'. We have the wrong notion that to combat fear, all we need is to summon all the courage we have but in the end, only our faith in Jesus can save us.
Jesus saw their faith. We are in front of a proof that while faith is a personal adherence to Jesus, it is at the same time communal. The paralytic was cured only because he believed but also because of the faith of those who carried him to Jesus. This should teach us the value of nourishing one another's faith life with our brothers and sisters in Community. The Lord constituted the Church as a Community to encourage and enrich one another in our pilgrim way to Him.
Vocation to Priesthood and religious life, if we fall short of workers in the Lord's Vineyard, it is also because we have lamentably failed to look for them. This task is given to all members and hence make the daring proposal to the young people we know, who may be just there, near to you and waiting for your gentle prodding.
"DO NOT BE AFRAID", repeated three times seeks a demonstrate that God will be in charge of those who follow Him and will faithfully carry out His Promise. No amount of human effort can effect change without God by Our Side. Let's head to The House of God's Love where even a strand of hair is left unharmed. Lets only believe and fear no more.
Proverbs: The poor, foolish, sinners and all who are righteous and wise makes The Lord their refuge.

##### Day 261 Is religion boring?

Many people complain that Christianity is boring and has a bunch of rules. We hear phrases like ‚ÄúI tried church, it‚Äôs not for me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get anything out of the sermon today‚Äù.
If one doesn‚Äôt experience anything it mostly is not a problem with the Church or the Bible or God the problem lies in the person. As we read in the parable of the Sower, the "seed" and the "Sower" are always good there is no problem with them. The Sower is very generous with the seed, He is sowing it on all types of soil ‚Äì on the paths, the rocky ground, among thorns, and on good soil.

The problem lies in the soil, in the person itself.
The person does not even listen to the word of God being proclaimed at Church ‚Äì is like the seed sown on the path that the evil one snatched away. When we are distracted or not paying attention at church or while reading God‚Äôs word ‚Äì the evil one is snatching away all the good seed that is being sown.

We may be the type of person who listens to the word and accepts it with joy, however, it does not take root in us ‚Äì we easily forget it and move on to the next thing.

Or we may be the third type of soil that grows the seed into a plant but gets choked as it‚Äôs growing among thorns, thorns are the care and anxieties and troubles of this world that cause us to lose the Word we have received.

So the next time we try to complain about the word of God or the Church we should also examine ourselves ‚Äì to see if we were good soil or we let the evil one snatch the seed away or did not let the word take root or let the cares of this world distract us from the word of God.
Everyone at Mass receives the same Eucharist, yet some turn out to be saints and others, sinners. It's not about what we receive but what we allow Christ to do in us.

As we have dedicated a year to reading God‚Äôs word in this BIAY program, I hope and pray that we are all being good soil for the good seed we receive.

I pray that we produce abundant fruit ‚Äì 30, 60 and a 100 fold fruit and produce.

May we be good soil for the Word of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 261 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 11:3
*"Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"*

John was the one through whom God had revealed the identity of the Son of God (John 1:34) to the people. So why was John doubtful now after so many months?
There are three possibilities:

AAA)
John was going to be executed shortly, but his disciples were still following him instead of following Jesus, probably because they were doubtful about Jesus being the promised divine Messiah king. Therefore, John sent his disciples to Jesus with the question so that Jesus might clear their doubts, as well as our doubts, that Jesus is the Messiah who was to come.

BBB)
Like many of the Jews, John too may have been expecting a royal warrior Messiah who would free them from oppression under the Roman enemy and their allies. The silent healing miracles and peaceful preaching of Jesus, who was living a poor man's life, didn't fit the description of a royal warrior Messiah whom they were expecting.
This is one reason why the Jews, to this day, are still waiting for the promised Messiah.

CCC)
While in prison John had heard of the miracles Jesus was performing. It was getting close to the time for John's execution and John must have been expecting and hoping that Jesus would come and use His miraculous power to free him (John) from prison;

John was the one who led the people to Christ, but when John himself was in distress and there was no sign of Jesus, John started doubting if Jesus was the God of Israel who was to come as prophesied (Malachi 3:1), and free them from oppression (Malachi 3:5).

When Jesus received the message He only reminded John‚Äôs messengers of the miracles which He (Jesus) had performed.

Sometimes we too can be in the same situation like John (the Baptist).
We may lead people to Christ and assure them that Jesus will be with them during their difficult times. But when we ourselves are going through distress and we cannot see help coming in the vicinity, then we may tend to get doubtful whether Jesus really has the power to save us from our difficult times and whether we preached correctly about Him.

During such depressing moments Jesus will remind us of all the miracles which He has performed in our lives so that we start counting our blessings, and don‚Äôt focus on the storm which has hit our lives.

Matthew 11:12
*From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent people are taking it by force.*

Jesus was not talking about physical violence in the sense of doing harm. He was talking about the fact that the people of God must be determined. We must be willing to ‚Äúfight the good fight of faith.‚Äù
Christian life is a constant battle with the evil spirits who are represented by humans on earth.

‚ÄúWe wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers in heavenly places‚Äù (2 Corinthians 10:3-6).

There is no such thing as ‚Äúquietism‚Äù in the Church.
We cannot be passive and make it to Heaven. We must actively and determinately co-operate with God‚Äôs grace. We must ‚Äúget violent‚Äù in the Spirit of God, and not by any illicit means.

Matthew 11:18-19
*‚ÄùJohn came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‚ÄòHe has a demon‚Äô; the Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‚ÄòLook, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!‚Äô‚Äù*

The Pharisees always found some fault with almost all their prophets, including John and Jesus. They were not satisfied with anyone.

Like those Pharisees, our pride does not allow us to accept any of God‚Äôs anointed ones. Whichever priest, preacher or spiritual leader God sends to us, we always have some negative comments to make about them. When they preach, we are busy trying to find some fault in their behaviour or in their preaching, instead of listening to the message which God has sent through them. We don't seem to be satisfied with any of them even though God sends us messengers who are not identical in their character or in their preaching or in their approach. We forget that God's messengers are human like us and therefore not perfect. We forget that we ourselves are not perfect.

Matthew 11:28-30
*Come to me, all you that labor and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for yourselves; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.‚Äù*
Yoke refers to the religious law (1 Kings 12:4 & 14).
The kings of the old Covenant had introduced harsh laws for the people which made it difficult for the people to follow them.
Jesus gave us a simple law "to love God and love our neighbour as ourselves" along with the gift of the Holy Spirit, through the sacraments. The Holy Spirit helps us to follow the new law. It is the spiritual gift which the old Covenant people did not have and so they struggled manually to obey the law.
When we love one another our sufferings become light.

Matthew 12:8
*The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.*
In the old Covenant, God was the Lord of the Sabbath and only God could change the Sabbath or authorize someone to work on the Sabbath (Leviticus 23:3). By these words Jesus was revealing His identity as God.
Jesus was never against the Sabbath. He never questioned the sacredness of the Sabbath. He was working towards restoring the purpose of the Sabbath according to the original Will of God at creation.
The elders had covered the spirit of the Law with numerous traditions. Although their intentions were noble, over the centuries, in the process of honoring the Sabbath the spirit of the Law was forgotten. Jesus was uncovering them and gradually fulfilling the Law by disregarding the man-made traditions which were against God‚Äôs Will.

Matthew 12:14
*The Pharisees went out and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, to put him to death.*
It is very unusual for the religious authorities to join hands with secular political groups to destroy an enemy.
The Herodians were a group of Jews who were loyal to King Herod, although Herod was not a Jew. They were normally at war with the Pharisees and Scribes.
But now the Pharisees and Scribes joined together with their enemy (the Herodians) because now they both had a common enemy (Jesus) whom they saw as more powerful than both their groups put together, even though Jesus had no army or weapons.

Matthew 12:29
*How can one enter a strong man‚Äôs house and plunder his property, without first tying up the strong man? Then indeed the house can be plundered.*
By His sacrifice on the Cross Jesus put Satan on a leash (tied him), and by His resurrection Jesus has given us the sacraments to release all God‚Äôs people who were kept there in bondage in Satan‚Äôs house since the time of Adam.

Matthew 12:32
*Whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this life or in the life to come.*
This statement of Jesus implies that there are some sins that can be forgiven in the next life and some that cannot, which was according to the general belief of the Jews.
Mortal sins cannot be forgiven after physical death but venial sins can and will be forgiven after physical death when the person has completed his/her purification term in Sheol / Purgatory.

Matthew 12:38-42
The Pharisees & Scribes did not ask for a miracle from Jesus because He hadn‚Äôt performed any or because they hadn‚Äôt seen any, and not that they would believe Him if He performed one more. They were probably looking for entertainment.
Jonah loved his people and was willing to die to save them.
Jesus too loved His people and was willing to die to save them.
Jonah was in the belly of the whale (the earth) (Jonah 2:2 & 6) for 3 days.
Jesus too was in the belly of the earth for 3 days.
After he came out of the whale‚Äôs belly, Jonah went to the evil and adulterous Ninevah with a message from God and Ninevah repented.
After the Resurrection of Jesus, Peter and Paul went to evil and adulterous Rome with a message from God (the Gospel) and many in Rome repented and converted to Christianity.
After Ninevah repented, God used them as an axe to destroy Israel.
After many in Rome repented and converted, Jesus used pagan Rome as an axe to destroy Jerusalem.
The evil and adulterous Jews had asked Jesus for a sign (Matthew 12:38-39) and Jesus promised to give them the sign of Jonah. Jesus fulfilled His promise 40 years later (in AD 70) when Rome destroyed Jerusalem.

Matthew 12:43-45
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc. A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are Baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don‚Äôt keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying. We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Matthew 12:48
And he replied, ‚ÄúWho are my mother and my brothers?‚Äù And looking at those who sat around him, he said, ‚ÄúHere are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.‚Äù
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to bear the Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Matthew 13:24‚Äì30
The weed/darnel grows with the wheat and both look identical. We can only tell the difference when the wheat starts bearing fruit.

The devil is very tricky and evil. He takes half the truth and twists it. He then tries to prove how it matches with God's Word (Genesis 3:4-5; Luke 4:9-11). If he succeeds in tricking us, it may sometimes be too late before we realize our errors, after we see the consequences, as in the case of Adam and Eve. But, like Jesus, if we know our scriptures well, then we will know the difference between good and evil, and between truth and lies, and save ourselves in time.

The line of separation between good and evil, also runs within each one of us.
Do we want to believe the full truth (the wheat) or are we happy to settle for half truth (the weeds/darnel)?

Matthew 13:31-32
The first century Jews, who knew their scriptures well, would have expected Jesus to compare the Kingdom of God (the new Israel) to a cedar of Lebanon, but instead Jesus compared it to a mustard shrub which grows upto 6 to 10 feet in height.
That is because:
A) the Kingdom of God *is glorious* but does not *look glorious* like the kingdoms of this world.
B) the Kingdom of God began with 12 inexperienced members and God empowered them to expand the Kingdom.
C) the size of God‚Äôs Kingdom (the Church) depends on the *number of saints* and not on the *number of people*.
D) the Kingdom of God spreads like the roots of the mustard shrub which spread rapidly and eventually occupy the entire garden where they are planted.

Matthew 13:33
Jesus used examples from creation to teach the people because Israel was an agricultural society and also because God speaks to us and teaches us through His creation.

Preparing bread is one such example.
To prepare bread we must :

1. *crush the grains.*
   This should remind us of the scourging & death of Jesus to form the Church.
2. *then we combine the flour with water.*
   This should remind us of the baptized people meeting together for worship in Church as one family of God.
3. *then we add yeast for the dough to rise.* (Luke 13:21)
   This should remind us to spread the Word of God so that we can bring people to Christ and help the Kingdom of God to grow.
4. *then we bake the bread.*
   This should remind us that together we are one Body in Christ when we celebrate the new Passover (the Mass).
5. *then we consume the bread.*
   This should remind us that when we receive the Bread of Life / Eucharist (Communion) we are all united with Christ in a spiritual marriage.

Matthew 13:52
*And he said to them, ‚ÄúTherefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.‚Äù*
The kingdom of Heaven cannot be understood unless we understand how the new Testament is hidden in the old and the old Testament is revealed in the new.
In other words, to understand the new Testament we must first understand its Jewish roots.

On one side are the gentiles and on the other side are the Jews and Jesus is the hinge between the two.

##### Day #262 Authority ‚Äì Keys to the Kingdom

Jesus and his disciples go on a 29-mile hike ‚Äì to a place where most Jews would not want to even go. Caesarea Philippi was in a hills country which was the epic center of all pagan worship. In the caves of the big Rocky Mountains were temples to many pagan gods, and there was a lot of pagan sacrifice happening at any given time. Jesus possibly took the disciples to the highest peak and asked them this question ‚ÄúWho do you say that I am?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho do people say that the Son of Man is?‚Äù 14 And they said, ‚ÄúSome say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.‚Äù 15 He said to them, ‚ÄúBut who do you say that I am?‚Äù 16 Simon Peter answered, ‚ÄúYou are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.‚Äù 17 And Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúBlessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. 18 And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.‚Äù

When Peter declared Jesus as the Messiah, the son of the living God, Peter was also saying that all of those other pagan religions are nothing but fake earthly idol worship. Jesus in return standing on a big high rock proclaims Peter as the rock on which Jesus would build His church. Unlike the rock in Caesarea Philippi that housed all pagan temples ‚Äì Jesus is building His church in living people ‚Äì our bodies will be the temple of the Holy Spirit.

The gates of Hades will not prevail against us ‚Äì is not a defensive statement but an offensive statement. So we the church should not be fearful of the evil one and his kingdom ‚Äì but the evil one has to be afraid of us ‚Äì here the reference is on the gates of Hades ‚Äì that means we will be able to go to the gates of Hell and defeat the evil one in his own home ground. Even the gates of Hell will not be able to stop us, who bear the light of Christ.

Peter is given authority ‚Äì the keys to the Kingdom.
In order to understand the Keys to the Kingdom, we need to put on the lens of the Israeli Kingdom, not this 21st-century lens. The King was the supreme authority, but when he was going away, he would give all governing authority to the ‚Äúal-habbayit‚Äù he would give him this big Key that he would literally carry on his shoulder. He would have the same authority as the king, along with authority he was also given the responsibility to be a father to the people. As we read the below verses we can read about the authority and the role of the al-habbayit/stewart/father over the household.

‚ÄúIn that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots‚Äîall its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. Is 22:20-25

This prophecy is fulfilled when Jesus instituted Peter as the first Pope(Papa/Father) the ‚Äúal-habbayit‚Äù.
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.‚Äù Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Mat 16:18-20
The concept of the papacy is not something new that was introduced by the catholic church it‚Äôs seen back in Isiah. The al-habbayit who had the key which opened the gates of the kingdom and the treasury, he had the authority to bind and loose. The first pope Peter did this very role, we can see the evidence in the acts of the apostles and other letters ‚Äì they would always consult Peter on doctrine. This did not end with Peter, it was handed down to Linus, and Clement (who are mentioned in the NT).
Till this day the present Pope has the authority passed down, to bind and lose. In the OT we have read how the judges and lower and upper courts would sit in judgment. Creating laws and regulations ‚Äì going back and forth and finally agreeing on what is the law.
In the same way, the Catholic Church is the universal church that has the authority given by Jesus to define and expand the new law of the Spirit. The Old Testament temple authorities had very heavy laws that they would enforce on the faithful. Jesus abolishes all those man-made requirements and laws ‚Äì like the washing of hands/cups and eating of certain foods only. Jesus gives this role to Peter and the disciples.
Jesus takes us back to the heart of the commandments that God gave us to love God and to love our neighbor. Jesus appointed Peter and every succeeding pope to along with the councils to bind into law all the teachings of the Holy Spirit, the Bible is one of the initial things that the catholic church was instrumental in discerning the books that belong and finally authorizing the official books of the Bible. We will learn more about what the CC teaches when we do the catechism in a year. The catechism of the catholic church is the work of the church ‚Äìinspired by the Holy Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 262 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 14:15-20
This was a demonstration of how God wants to use our bodies to help the poor and needy till all are satisfied physically, which is in imitation of how Jesus generously feeds us, spiritually, with His Body (Communion).

Therefore, after seeking God‚Äôs blessings we must generously share whatever we can, with the less fortunate ones, and God will multiply our gifts so that we can share more till all are satisfied, just as Jesus generously multiplies and shares His sacramental Body (Communion) to feed us so that our souls are completely nourished.

*Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúThere is no need for them to go away; give them some food yourselves.‚Äù*
Jesus told the Apostles to share whatever they had, and they did, and God multiplied their resources so that everyone's hunger was satisfied.
Jesus tells us the same ‚Äúgive them what you have.‚Äù
We don‚Äôt have to be a Bible scholar to share the Word of God.
We can share whatever we learnt and God will multiply our resources.
We don‚Äôt have to be a millionaire to help the less fortunate ones.
We can just share with them whatever we have; whether it is food, clothes, love, prayers, or anything else, but we must share the best what we have and with a clean heart.

Peter gave Jesus only his friendly love (John 21:15-19), and Jesus accepted it, multiplied it and transformed it into sacrificial love, so that Peter ended up giving his life for Jesus.
In every act of generosity Jesus says, "You do your best and I will do the rest."
What we do not have, we cannot give and that is where we trust in God.
Let us therefore offer up to Jesus whatever loaves and fish we can offer, so that Jesus can multiply them and transform them for the growth of His Kingdom.

This miracle was not just about sharing. This was a miracle of God providing His people with supernatural food.
By the miraculous multiplication of the bread in the desert, Jesus was echoing the daily miracle of the first Exodus which was the miraculous bread from Heaven (Manna) given to the people by God to nourish their bodies during their physical journey through the desert.

Jesus was also foreshadowing the daily miracle of the new Exodus when God would feed His people with the Heavenly bread (the Eucharist / Communion) to nourish their bodies during their spiritual journey through the desert of earthly exile.
This miracle was a foreshadow of the Last Supper when Jesus used the same pattern (Matthew 26:26-30 / Mark 14:22-26 / Luke 22:14-20 / 1 Corinth.11:23-25).
He took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to his disciples to be distributed.

Matthew 14:22-33
Peter was a fisherman, he knew how to swim (John 21:7) and he knew the destructive force of the storm. When he looked at Jesus he was able to walk on the water. But when he looked at the storm he was afraid and started to sink because he took his eyes away from Jesus and focused on the world which only put fear in his heart. His knowledge of the storm weakened his faith in Christ.

Like Peter, sometimes too much knowledge of worldly matters and impatience, weakens our faith in Christ by creating doubts. When we are focused on Jesus, we can walk through any storm undisturbed.

When Peter called out to Jesus to save him, Jesus immediately reached out and took Peter by the hand but calmed the strong wind later.
When we are caught up in the storms of life, if we call out to Jesus ‚ÄúLord save me‚Äù he will reach out his hand and help us through the storm if we obey Him.

Matthew 15:1-6
*And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?‚Äù*
Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined God‚Äôs truths. He instructed his followers to abide by the traditions that are not contrary to God‚Äôs commandments. And, as the Apostles taught (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15), the rest are to be obeyed.

Matthew 15:11
*Jesus summoned the crowd again and said to them, ‚ÄúHear me, all of you, and understand. It is not what goes into a person‚Äôs mouth that makes him ritually unclean. It is the things that come out from his mouth that makes him ritually unclean.‚Äù*
Eating something that is dirty can make our bodies sick but not our souls. Our souls become sick and weak when negative words come out of our mouths, and this puts both our souls and bodies in the custody of the devil whose aim is to destroy both.

It is therefore always best to speak when our mind is cool, even when we face people whose minds are out of control. When our mind is heated, the words which come out of our mouths can be physically and emotionally destructive to those around us, and spiritually destructive to our own souls.

The mouth is only one God-given outlet in our body where we can control what comes out of it because whatever words come out of our mouths will always come out by our choice.
So let us avoid negative words coming out of our mouths (example: gossiping, insulting, ridiculing, speaking ill about others, lying, harsh words, offensive language, etc.). If we are guilty of this sin then let us ensure to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and, thereafter, spread the light of Christ whenever we speak.

Matthew 15:22-23
*Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, ‚ÄúHave mercy on me, Lord, Son of David.‚Äù But he did not answer her at all.*
Sometimes when we pray to God to help our wayward children to come back to Him, we may notice that God remains silent for a long time.
The silence of God is not His indifference. When God is silent He is secretly planning mercy for the children while He is also planning the spiritual healing of the parents.
Therefore, while the parents pray for their children, they must also focus on examining themselves.

*And his disciples came and urged him, saying, ‚ÄúSend her away, for she keeps shouting after us.‚Äù*
When we cry to the Lord to have mercy on our children who have gone away from Him, and the people around us try to silence us or discourage us, let us remember that it was the persistent prayer of the Canaanite woman that delivered her daughter from the evil spirit, inspite of facing objection from people.

*He said in reply (to His disciples), ‚ÄúI was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.‚Äù*
Jesus neither gave His disciples the permission to send her away nor did He tell His disciples to remain silent like Him.
By telling His disciples that His mission was to preach first to the Jews, Jesus was actually telling her to wait for her turn till later.

*Jesus answered, ‚ÄúIt is not fair to take the children‚Äôs food and throw it to the dogs.‚Äù*
It may sound like Jesus was being rude to the woman, but that is exactly how it feels when our faith is being tested.
When Jesus compared the woman to a dog, she had two options :

1. she could allow her pride to control her, take the response of Jesus as an insult and leave Jesus, OR,
2. she could humble herself and accept that she was not the greatest.
   If she chose Option 1, then, because of her pride, her daughter would have to live with the demon all her life.
   But the Cannanite woman made a wise choice. She chose Option 2, and Jesus healed the child because of the faith, humility and persistent prayer of the mother.
   Let us learn from the Cannanite woman to humble ourselves and choose our words wisely when we communicate with others.

Matthew 16:15
*Then he said to them, ‚ÄúBut who do you say that I am?‚Äù*
Do we really believe that Jesus is the Messiah and that he can give us eternal life?
Do our words and actions show that we are true followers of Jesus?
Would we follow God‚Äôs commandments when we are going through suffering?
To believe that Jesus is the Messiah is to follow His way of self-denial and live for others even if we have to go through suffering.

Matthew 16:16-17
*Jesus said to Simon in reply, ‚ÄúBlessed are you, Simon, bar-Jonah (or son of Jonah). For flesh and blood (your human brain) has not revealed this to you, but it was given to you by my Father in heaven.‚Äù*
All knowledge and intelligence comes from God because He is the one who created our complex brain and without God we are nothing. Therefore, whenever we make wise decisions in life, it is not because of the power of our brain, but because God opens our mind and makes it possible for us to make those decisions. Therefore we need to be thankful to God and give Him the glory for all our achievements, instead of boasting about our achievements and enjoying the glory ourselves.

Matthew 16:18
*Jesus said to Simon, ‚ÄúAnd so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.‚Äù*
By these words Jesus confirmed the guarantee of His perpetual divine assistance to protect the Church (the Eucharist) from Satan.
By these words Jesus also assured all Christians that as long as we live we will not be deprived of the heavenly Bread (His mystical Body / the Eucharist).
Jesus, in His humanity, is, and will be, with us in the Eucharist / the consecrated Bread every day, until the end of time (Matthew 28:20),

Jesus confirmed Simon‚Äôs office as Pope in the Kingdom of God on earth (the Church):

1. by changing his name;
2. by declaring that Simon Peter would be the leader of the foundation stones on which the Church would be built (Revelation 21:14);
3. by giving Simon the spiritual keys to the Kingdom of Heaven, an authority which rested only the Prime Minister in the Davidic Kingdom;
4. by giving Simon the power to bind and loose (the authority to interpret God‚Äôs Law, to absolve or retain sins, to pronounce doctrinal judgements, and to make disciplinary decisions in the Church) (John 20:20-23; Deut. 17:8-13).

Name change was meant to reflect the divine mission of the name owner.
Jesus was going to make Simon Peter the rock-solid foundation of the Church.
God does not call the qualified. This means God does not call us for His divine mission on the basis of our expertise but He may use our talents to accomplish His divine mission through us.

Peter himself was the longest reigning Pope, occupying his office from the year of the first Pentecost in 30 AD until around 67 AD. After Simon Peter‚Äôs death, his episcopal office was taken over by his successor, Pope Linus (AD 67), the same Linus who served the Church during the time of Paul (2 Timothy 4:21). Pope Francis is the 266th Pope since Simon Peter.

Matthew 17:22-27
Jesus didn't have to pay the Temple tax but He still gave to the Temple.
Maybe it is time for us to examine the level of our generosity towards the Church.

##### Day #263 Forgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts us

As we read through all the parables the theme of forgiveness seems to run through all of them.
The Good shepherd goes after the lost sheep with so much love and forgiveness instead of anger and frustration. If you find yourself in sin today and are feeling down and miserable ‚Äì don‚Äôt worry Jesus the Good Shepherd is coming to seek after you ‚Äì He loves you and will forgive you ‚Äì in fact, He will rejoice over you.

What do you think? If a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? 13 And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. 14 So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost. Mat 18:12-14

Now ‚ÄúForgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts us‚Äù that is why Peter asks how many times should we forgive.

21 Then Peter came and said to him, ‚ÄúLord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?‚Äù 22 Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúNot seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times. Mat 18:21-22

Jesus gives peter an answer that he didn‚Äôt like ‚Äì did Jesus mean that we should forgive 7\*70 times which is 490 times. No, we need to forgive them the 491st time as well, Jesus was using Hyperbole. Just like we say, ‚ÄúWill be back in a second‚Äù ‚Äì we mean in a few mins don‚Äôt we.
Jesus helps us understand this better with this parable, which shows that we should be forgiving because we have been forgiven.

The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant
23 ‚ÄúFor this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. 24 When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him; 25 and, as he could not pay, his lord ordered him to be sold, together with his wife and children and all his possessions, and payment to be made. 26 So the slave fell on his knees before him, saying, ‚ÄòHave patience with me, and I will pay you everything.‚Äô 27 And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt. 28 But that same slave, as he went out, came upon one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him by the throat, he said, ‚ÄòPay what you owe.‚Äô 29 Then his fellow slave fell down and pleaded with him, ‚ÄòHave patience with me, and I will pay you.‚Äô 30 But he refused; then he went and threw him into prison until he would pay the debt. 31 When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their lord all that had taken place. 32 Then his lord summoned him and said to him, ‚ÄòYou wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. 33 Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?‚Äô 34 And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. 35 So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.‚Äù Mat 18:23-35

Here the number thousand talents that the servant owed to the King ‚Äì is actually such a large number when you do the math on it.
ONE TALENT = 20.4kgs (of Gold or silver)
Ten thousand Talents = 20.4 x 10,000 = 2,04,000 kgs in measurement
1 gram of gold is like $50 so for the 2,04,000 kgs ‚Äì it is like $10,2000,000

So the servant owed the king 100 Million dollars.

The point here is the King knew that the servant will never be able to pay off the debt, so the king forgives the servant and expects the servant to do the same. When the servant did not forgive those who were indebted to him, that is when the King threw the servant into prison. The lesson to learn is we should forgive others as we have been shown great mercy from God. Let us learn to forgive our brothers and sisters from the heart.
Forgiveness is the "Key" that unlocks God‚Äôs super-abundant mercy.
Even if we don‚Äôt like to forgive because it hurts so much, we should pray for the strength to forgive those who hurt us and love them even though it hurts.
For our salvation depends on our forgiveness. We pray this prayer everyday when we say the Our father.

"Forgive us our trespasses ‚ÄúAS‚Äù we forgive those who trespass against us" Mat 6:12

In refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our hearts are closed and their hardness makes them impervious to the Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are opened to his grace. CCC 2840

So let us strive very hard to make things right with everyone, prayer and forgive them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY #264 THE NECESSITY FOR WATCHFULNESS

I think one of the most important things in life is to be prepared for Jesus‚Äôs second coming. In our lifetime we will surely meet the Lord either in the second coming or when we die. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful ‚Äì for no one knows the time when the Lord comes.

36 ‚ÄúBut about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. 37 For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, 39 and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. 40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. 41 Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. 42 Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. 43 But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.

The day of the Lord will come when people least expect it, there will be two types of people on the day of the Lord. The first kind of people are those who are prepared for Him, and the second type is those who are not prepared. Two women were grinding food, one was taken and one was left back, two were in the field one was taken and one was left back.

Which person would you want to be? I guess you will say that ‚ÄúI want to be the one that was taken, the one that was prepared‚Äù. It‚Äôs simple just follow the two keywords ‚Äì watchful and prayerful.

Just like in the parable of the wedding banquet, the banquet was ready and the people were not prepared for it. Those who were invited did not show up, which lead the servants to go and bring in all the people who were hungry. The people who came to the wedding banquet were not dressed accordingly. They were not prepared for the wedding banquet. The two keywords are watchful and prayerful.

11 ‚ÄúBut when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing a wedding robe, 12 and he said to him, ‚ÄòFriend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?‚Äô And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the attendants, ‚ÄòBind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äô 14 For many are called, but few are chosen.‚Äù

The Church provides us with two seasons every year ‚Äì Advent and Lent. Advent and Lent are perfect seasons to prepare "the way of the Lord". Just as every sports team plays different seasons ‚Äì probably yearly. We get to work on our readiness every year, through fasting prayer, and almsgiving we strengthen our resolve to become holy and renew our spiritual lives. May the Lord find us ready when He comes in glory, the best way to be ready is to stay in friendship with Jesus, always stay in the state of grace and be in communion with the church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 264 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 22:1-14 (1)
In this parable, God the Father is the King (Matthew 5:35) and Jesus is the bridegroom (Matthew 9:15).
Three times God the Father sent out invitations to humanity for the marriage (Passover / Mass) of His Son (Jesus).

The 1st invitation symbolizes the initial call to human beings, when God created Adam and Eve. He made a Covenant with them, but they broke it, and their descendants followed in their footsteps, thus declining the invitation to God‚Äôs banquet.

The 2nd invitation was for Israel, God‚Äôs chosen people led by Moses. He invited them to enter into a Covenant, at Mount Sinai, but this was also broken. Some ignored the invitation because they were too busy satisfying their own desires and others tortured or killed many of the prophets and priests and therefore God allowed their country to be destroyed by foreign countries.

So a 3rd invitation was sent out, through the Apostles/bishops, to the whole of humanity, good and bad alike (Matthew 13:47‚Äì48), and some people started accepting Christianity, but not everyone who accepted Christianity was accepted by the King.
One man was cast out because he wasn‚Äôt wearing a wedding robe, and this seems harsh. In the ancient world, it was customary for the person hosting the banquet to provide wedding robes for the guests. These robes were freely given by the host, just like salvation is freely given to anyone who wants to accept it.

By wearing their wedding robes the guests were honoring the host, which means that the man who was not wearing a wedding robe was showing extreme disrespect for the King and his son. The King couldn‚Äôt believe that someone would turn down a wedding robe that was so freely given. When the man was questioned he had no answer.

The robe (the grace of God) was given to the man and all he had to do was put it on, but the man chose to reject the grace of God. He wanted to enjoy the banquet but on his own terms, not on the King‚Äôs terms.

This is like following only selective parts of the Bible or creating our own brand of Christianity, or making decisions based only on what we think is right and not considering if our decisions are right in God‚Äôs eyes.
There are many who want to enjoy the heavenly banquet, but on their own terms. They want to follow their own gospels or ideologies. If we want to be part of the heavenly banquet, we have to follow all the rules laid out by the King.

If we are not covered with a white robe (in a state of grace), then we cannot attend the banquet (the marriage supper of the Lamb / Communion).

Matthew 22:1-14 (2)
Our wedding garment must be made up of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness, love, (Colossians 3:12-14). In other words, we can receive the robe of righteousness when peace, gratitude and the Word of God are within us (Colossians 3:15-16) and we engage ourselves with works of mercy, that is, loving concern for the people around us, specially to the least of our brothers and sisters.
We cannot participate in God's banquet of love if we remain indifferent to the suffering and needs of the less fortunate ones around us. We cannot say we love the God who we cannot see if we do not love our neighbours who we can see (1 John 4:20).

Therefore, before we gather together for the heavenly banquet every Sunday, let us ensure that we have kept our eyes and ears open to see and hear the voice of God through the cries of the needy ones so that we can be of help to them in whatever way we can.
Let us pray that we may be worthy of a place in God's kingdom by living our lives on earth according to His Will.

Matthew 22:15-21
*"Is it lawful to pay taxes to Emperor Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?‚Äù*
Herodians were a group of people who had made a deal with the Romans to allow the Herodian dynasty to rule Israel as vassal kings in the name of the Roman Emperors, allowing the Romans to occupy Israel, ensuring that Israel would pay their taxes to Rome, etc. Because of this deal the Herodians were not very popular with the Pharisees.
If Jesus said "yes" then the people would be angry and go against Him for supporting the Romans;
If Jesus said "no" then the Herodians would be angry and would definitely take the message to the Romans.
The answer of Jesus is not a confirmation that state and religion are to be considered separate. Everything that belonged to Caesar ultimately belonged to God.

*‚ÄúGive to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.‚Äù*
God gives us leaders for our countries to be good stewards of His creation. They are God's instruments given to us for maintaining public order and for the common good. We are therefore bound to pay our taxes regularly and pray for our governments that they may always do God‚Äôs Will (1 Timothy 2:1‚Äì2), while we give ourselves to God, body, mind and soul, for His work and to worship Him, because we belong to Him.

We must respect our governing authorities and obey the state Laws, if they are in line with God‚Äôs Will, because they are legitimate authorities.
Let us ask our Lord to forgive us for the times we have given ourselves to our Caesars (ungodly authorities) instead of giving ourselves to God.

Matthew 22:23
*Some Sadducees, who don‚Äôt believe in the resurrection, came to him and asked him a question.*
Sadducees don't believe in the resurrection, so they asked a tricky question. If Jesus failed to prove the resurrection then He would be proving Himself to be a false Messiah.

Resurrected life is not a transfer of earthly life into Heaven. It is a life of supreme communion with God.

The Pharisees believed in the resurrection.
The Sadducees did not believe in anything that was not mentioned in the Torah. They also didn't accept any word that was not mentioned in the Torah. Therefore they didn't believe in the resurrection because the word *"resurrection"* was not mentioned in the Torah.

The Sadducees were mocking the faith for which seven brothers and their mother had died, during the reign of king Antiochus (2 Maccabees 7:1-41).

Matthew 22:28-30
Marriage between man and woman was designed by God for procreation of life on earth to keep the human race alive, because every human has to be tested for their faith (in God), except those who die in the womb or before the age of accountability and those who are mentally unstable.
Man and woman must fill the earth with holy children who would then be taken to Heaven by God at the appointed time.

Procreation serves the purpose of transmitting life to the next generation.
In Heaven there is no testing so whoever passes the test on earth goes to Heaven and that is the termination of procreation, therefore there is no need for marriage in Heaven.
But this is not out of any natural necessity; it is the way God designed it.
Those in Heaven can neither die physically nor spiritually.

Marriage between man and woman is only a sign of the relation between Jesus and His bride (the Church) (Ephesians 5:23). Just as man and woman unite to bring forth new human life, similarly our marriage with Jesus, when we receive the Body of Christ / Communion, must cause us to go forth and evangelize the world to bring souls into the Church.

‚ÄúPeople in Heaven are like angels‚Äù does not mean that they will be spirits forever. Humans are special beings composed of body and soul whereas angels are pure spirits. When humans go to Heaven they will initially be only spirits but after the Last Judgement all humans in Heaven will receive their glorified human bodies, except Jesus and His Mother who were the only two humans who went to Heaven with their sinless human bodies.
What Jesus meant was that when humans go to Heaven they will live forever like the angels.

Matthew 22:35-39
The Gospel is a message of God‚Äôs pure, unconditional, sacrificial love for us. He wants us to return that love by loving all the people who we meet during our lifetime. But we struggle to love others because love was damaged in the Garden of Eden when humans made a Covenant with the devil and allowed him to control their conscience.
Let us, therefore, ensure that we receive the sacraments (Confession and Communion) regularly, so that we can receive the spiritual strength and ability to love others as we love ourselves and as God loves us.

Matthew 23:1-7
Jesus was not abolishing religion because it is God‚Äôs Will that we must be religious as well as spiritual, which is why He spent four decades in the wilderness giving Moses minute details to train the people of the old Covenant for the religious rituals of the new Covenant.
We cannot do away with religion just as we cannot do away with politics because humans are made of body and soul composite.
Therefore, just as God gives us political leaders to govern our bodies, so also God gives us religious leaders to govern our souls.

When majority of the Christians live in disobedience to God, that is, they receive Communion with mortal sins, or don't attend Mass, or don‚Äôt help the poor, etc., the world does not get sanctified and therefore God is not glorified.

Jesus commanded us to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20) and shine our light wherever we go (Matthew 5:14-16). When we ignore or neglect this command we make Satan‚Äôs army stronger. Instead of spreading the Gospel, we gradually start blending with the pagan world, our sins increase and our culture becomes corrupt.

In short, if we are not willing to transform the world to be godly, then the world will gradually transform us (into pagans).

And when we get religious and political leaders from this corrupt culture we cannot expect good leaders.
Such leaders may constantly make ungodly decisions because it is usually to win the people‚Äôs favour. When our desires are disordered we go along with their decisions and thus we walk on the road to hell along with our leaders because we ourselves are not aware of what is right and what is wrong.

Those who live in friendship with Christ will know when their leaders (religious and political) make decisions that are not in line with God‚Äôs Will.

Therefore, it is important that we shine our light wherever we go by living faithful Christian lives, receiving the sacraments (Confession & Communion) regularly, helping the poor and needy, praying daily and obeying all what Jesus has commanded us to do.

Matthew 23:19
The Altar of the old Covenant was a fore shadow of the Altar of the new Covenant. The Altar of the new Covenant represents the Body of Christ after it is consecrated. God had commanded the people that the Altar must always be consecrated before using it for worship (Exodus 29:37) because it is the Body of Christ that makes our gifts holy, through the power of the Holy Spirit, when we place them on the Altar, the most important ones being bread and wine.
But unfortunately the people started treating unconsecrated material goods as more holy than the consecrated Altar (Matthew 23:19).

Matthew 24:29-31
Jesus was speaking of two destructions: the Temple and the city.
The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe.
The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.

Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city. It was a Temple with a city around it, but it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).

Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city. It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it. The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally (because the Church has parishes all over the world).

##### DAY #265 FAITH & WORKS

We are not saved just by believing but our faith should have associated works. Faith without works is dead, of course, we are not saved because of our work only. We cannot separate faith and works ‚Äì because they are married together and one without the other is incomplete.

14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,‚Äù and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? 17 So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead. James 2:14-17
We see that in the final judgment of the nations people are either saved or lost eternally because of their works.
The Judgment of the Nations
31 ‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, 33 and he will put the sheep at his right hand and the goats at the left. 34 Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‚ÄòCome, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; 35 for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.‚Äô 37 Then the righteous will answer him, ‚ÄòLord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink? 38 And when was it that we saw you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you clothing? 39 And when was it that we saw you sick or in prison and visited you?‚Äô 40 And the king will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.‚Äô 41 Then he will say to those at his left hand, ‚ÄòYou that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; 42 for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.‚Äô 44 Then they also will answer, ‚ÄòLord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not take care of you?‚Äô 45 Then he will answer them, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.‚Äô 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.‚Äù Mat 25: 31-46

The sin of omission is the sin of failing to love your neighbor and failing to come to the aid of those who are in need. The works that we are called to do are feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting those in prison in general caring for the needy. Our faith should move us to action, we cannot just say ‚ÄúGod bless‚Äù to a person in need and expect everything to be fine. We cannot say we have faith and do no works, faith, and works are tightly interlinked.
We cannot sit tight on the gifts and talents that Lord gives us and expect everything to be okay. Like in the parable of the talents, the ones who used the talents were rewarded.
The servant of did nothing with the talents was punished and thrown in hell.

But his master replied, ‚ÄòYou wicked and lazy slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter? 27 Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received what was my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to the one with the ten talents. 29 For to all those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. 30 As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.‚Äô Mat 25

Let us not be lazy with all the resources that are given to us, let us come to the aid of those in need. Let us do as much charity as we can and bless those who are struggling.
May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 265 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 25:13
*Jesus said, ‚Äústay awake, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Lord will come.‚Äù*
Forewarned is forearmed.
In our day-to-day life many such situations arise when we have to be prepared in advance for a crisis, but we ignore them or put them off for another day, thinking we know better.
God has given us freedom of choice to obey Him always and live in a state of grace at all times so that when Jesus knocks at the door we will be ready to go with Him.
Let us, therefore, stay alert, be aware and be prepared at all times.

Matthew 25:34-36
The sheep go to Heaven, not just because they did the works of mercy and checked off the item on their checklist but, because they did those works out of love and compassion for their neighbour. The Gospel is a message of love and compassion, the kind of heart that God has. And because God's kingdom is a holy kingdom it is important that all the subjects/children keep themselves sanctified by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly.

Matthew 26:1-5
*It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.*
God had given these two festivals to the Israelites as two separate feasts but during the time of Jesus they were both being celebrated together as desired by God.
Both feasts of the old Covenant were shadows of the Unleavened Bread (Communion) and Passover (Mass) of the new Covenant which Jesus inaugurated in the Upper Room and finished on Calvary and thereafter gave them to the Church to be celebrated until the end of time.

*The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, ‚ÄúNot during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.‚Äù*
The normal population of Jerusalem was around 40,000 but during the Passover it would be around 200,000, because God had mandated that every male Jew must go to Jerusalem to celebrate the old Passover, so that, without their knowledge, every male Jew would be a witness to the sacrifice of the Lamb (of God) on the Cross for the first Passover of the new Covenant, in atonement for their sins.

Everything was going according to God's divine plan and God allowed the evil ones to go ahead with their plan so that God‚Äôs plan would be fulfilled.

On the day and hour when the hour earthly lambs would be slaughtered for the old Passover to commemorate the physical liberation of the people of the old Israel from the evil Pharaoh, on the same day and hour the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) would be killed for the new Passover to spiritually liberate the baptized people of the new Israel (the Church) from Satan.

Matthew 26:14-16
*Then one of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, ‚ÄúWhat will you give me if I hand him over to you?‚Äù They paid him thirty pieces of silver, and from that time on he looked for an opportunity to hand Jesus over.*
Judas was chosen so that he could forget his past habits and become a faithful disciple of Christ. But somewhere in between Judas lost his focus on discipleship and focused more on the world. By choosing to betray Jesus he was committing a mortal sin and therefore had a tragic end.

We are baptized into Jesus to be His disciples by living holy lives and to evangelize the world by sharing the Word of God. But, like Judas, when we focus more on the pleasures and comforts of this world and lose our focus on our discipleship then, like Judas, we too are betraying Jesus and our soul may meet with a tragic end.

The chief priests bribed Judas to betray Jesus and Judas accepted the bribe to do the unlawful act of selling Jesus.

The chief priests represent those Christians who bribe others to get work done illegally, and Judas represents those Christians who accept or ask for bribes to proceed with work against the law.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with accepting bribes, like Judas, we too are standing on Calvary and selling Jesus to the devil to be scourged and crucified.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with giving bribes to do something unlawful, like the chief priests, we are guilty of scourging and crucifying Jesus.
Whether we give bribes or take bribes or whether we are the middle person in a bribe, in all three cases we commit a mortal sin. If we are guilty of being involved in a bribe in any way, we must return the bribe or give it away and confess our sins without delay.

Matthew 26:17-25
*On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, ‚ÄúWhere do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?‚Äù*
Before the institution of the Last Supper / Eucharist, the disciples prepared a Passover lamb for the feast. That earthly lamb was a symbol of the physical sacrifice of Jesus and was supposed to be the ‚ÄúLAST‚Äù animal sacrifice offered to God.

‚ÄúPreparation of the Passover‚Äù meant that the lambs would be slaughtered and then roasted by spitting them with skewers, that is, passing one skewer vertically through the back of the lamb from head to bottom and the other skewer through the shoulders from left to right. This was a shadow of the Lamb of God on the Cross.

Thus, by spitting the lambs during the Passover of the Old Covenant, the people were asked to slaughter and crucify the lambs and eat the flesh, as a shadow of the real sacrifice of the Lamb of God and the Passover meal (Communion) of the New Covenant.

Matthew 26:26
*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

The priest consumes the bread and wine separately because that is how Jesus gave it to them in the Upper Room. The offering of the sacrifice is complete only when the priest consumes both.

*This is my body ...........*
*This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

The words of consecration can be repeated by anyone, but the transubstantiation takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit only when an apostolic priest says the exact words in obedience to the command of Jesus because the authority was given only to the ordained apostles, who in turn must give that same authority to their apostolic successors. Therefore, if any other person repeats the words of consecration the bread and wine will still remain bread and wine; they will not be transformed.

Offering bread and wine separately is a symbol of death, because death begins when blood is separated from the body.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice. Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real. Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired. By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

When God became man, He took on our human matter (the dust of the earth).
When Jesus was on the earth and He healed the people of their sicknesses, cast out demons, gave them sight, cured the deaf and mute, etc., the people received the sacraments (graces) from the living visible God.
After the descent of the Holy Spirit Jesus pours His graces into us through the sacraments using ordinary earthly materials (water, bread, wine, oil, etc.) as an outward sign of an inward grace.
Therefore, when we receive the sacraments we receive the invisible but living Jesus. The sacraments continue the incarnational principle when God touched the earth (Mary's womb) so that we can encounter the living invisible Jesus during our lifetime.

The first Adam gave us the forbidden fruit and thus brought death to the world.
The new Adam (Jesus) gives us the blessed fruit (the consecrated bread) when we are in a state of grace and thus brings life to the world.

Wine is a symbol of God‚Äôs love or wrath.
In the Garden of Eden. Adam & Eve were drunk on God's wine of love. After the Original sin man and woman ran out of the wine of God‚Äôs love within them because they destroyed the divine life within them.
By giving us His Blood in the form of consecrated wine, during Mass, Jesus restores creation to its original form through.
He restores the relationship between God and man, between man & wife, between body & soul, and between humans & the rest of creation.

Matthew 26:47-49, 56, 69-74
*All 12 apostles received their priestly ordination (Holy Orders) in the Upper Room and all 12 of them had the Eucharist (Communion) but shortly after that Judas betrayed Jesus, Peter denied Jesus and the remaining 10 abandoned Jesus.*
Receiving Communion or any other sacraments is not a guarantee that the devil will stop tempting us to follow him. One mortal sin is enough for the devil to start controlling our thoughts, words and deeds, and make us use our bodies (eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc.) for sinful purposes. He has a million ways to fool us into committing sins. We must, therefore, remain alert to sin until the last day of our lives and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation whenever we fail.

*Jesus was taken away from the Apostles after Judas betrayed Him. Thereafter the apostles were scattered by Satan.*
When we betray Jesus with our sins, God leaves us because sin separates us from God. This automatically puts us in the hands of Satan whose aim is to destroy families and communities and eventually the Church, by causing division between the members.

##### Day #266 I am with you always until the end of the age

We read about Judas, the man in despair. He did not know what to do when he realized that he handed over an innocent man.

3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. 4 He said, ‚ÄúI have sinned by betraying innocent blood.‚Äù But they said, ‚ÄúWhat is that to us? See to it yourself.‚Äù 5 Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.Mat 27

We see that Judas gave into despair, he could not come to terms with the mistake he made. There was nothing and no one to console him ‚Äì he took his life.
Now none of us should ever feel like taking our life, because of what Jesus did for us. Jesus paid the price for all our sins, he took away all our distress, and Jesus promises to be with us always I mean ‚ÄúALWAYS‚Äù.
Jesus knows how it feels to be alone and to feel rejected and abandoned.

45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. 46 And about three o‚Äôclock Jesus cried with a loud voice, ‚ÄúEli, Eli, lema sabachthani?‚Äù that is, ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù
Jesus was crying out to Abba father ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy God my God why have you forsaken me?‚Äù
Can you imagine the pain that the Holy Trinity went through ‚Äì the Father and the Holy Spirit are always united with Jesus. Even though Jesus was united to the Father, Jesus was allowed to experience the feeling of abandonment. The feeling that we feel when people betray us and abandon us. Jesus was allowed to feel the separation of God that we feel when we commit sin.

We have a loving God who knows how it feels when people abandon us. That is why Jesus reminds us that He is with us all the days of our lives.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.Mat 28
Knowing that Jesus is with us we can feel confident about our mission, the mission to tell everyone that we have Jesus. We have the love of God.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.‚Äù Mat 28

May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 266 By Cynthia Dsilva

Matthew 27:3-5
*Why did Judas kill himself when his plan was successful?*

If Judas really wanted Jesus killed then he would have celebrated when Jesus was arrested because his plan was successful. But it seems like Judas's intentions were different.

Judas may have been one of those Jews who were expecting a royal warrior Messiah.
Judas fully believed in the power of Jesus because he had seen Jesus performing many miracles, but he found Jesus to be too timid to overthrow the Roman empire and liberate Israel with His miraculous power. In his pride Judas would have believed that with his brains and Jesus's power, he and Jesus together could overthrow the Romans and rule Israel, and Jesus would always be indebted to Judas for his brainwork to get Jesus the throne.

The temptation offered by Satan to Judas to betray Jesus, arose out of Judas‚Äôs knowledge of the power of Jesus. Satan put the thought into Judas‚Äôs head that by having Jesus handed over to the authorities through betrayal (Satan‚Äôs method), Judas would force Jesus to use His power to release Himself from the enemy. Thereafter, he (Judas) could instigate the crowds to crown Jesus as their earthly king. And this is exactly what Satan wanted.

When Judas betrayed Jesus, he was actually planning his own glory as the right hand man of Jesus, so when he saw that Jesus was going to be killed, Judas understood that his glorious plans had been shattered and he had miserably failed. It didn‚Äôt work out as he had planned it.

After what he had done he would have been afraid to face the rest of the Apostles and the disciples of Jesus in the same town and therefore killed himself out of fear and despair.

Instead of killing himself, if Judas would have humbled himself and repented for what he had done, Jesus would have forgiven him, but Judas‚Äôs pride did not allow him to do so.

Like Judas, when our hearts are filled with pride it is difficult for us to say "sorry" with remorse ("metanoia" in Greek) and we end up committing more sins to cover up our wrong doings by living in fear or shame.
Repenting and confessing our sins regularly makes us humble enough to live without fear or shame.

Matthew 27:11
*Pilate asked him, ‚ÄúAre you the King of the Jews?‚Äù*
The Chief Priests and elders of the Sanhedrin had accused Jesus of blasphemy. But Pilate was informed that Jesus was claiming to be the political king of the Jews. There was no mention of blasphemy in Pilate's court.
Why?

The Sanhedrin unanimously condemned Jesus as deserving death on grounds of "blasphemy" (a false accusation), because Jesus called Himself the Son of the most High (Mark 14:63-64).
But there was a problem.

The Sanhedrin wanted Jesus dead but they did not have the power and authority to issue a death sentence. That authority rested only with the Romans, and under the pagan Roman law ‚Äúblasphemy‚Äù was not an offence that deserved the death penalty because they themselves didn‚Äôt believe in God. So the Sanhedrin sent Jesus to Pilate charging Jesus with the crime of treason against the Romans (another false accusation) which, according to the Roman law deserved the death penalty.

That is why Pilate had the inscription fixed on the Cross which read ‚ÄúJesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews‚Äù (John 19:19) so that, in future, if anyone would dare to rise against and overthrow the Roman power then they would meet the same fate as Jesus did.

According to the Roman law, the inscription fixed on the Cross was to indicate the crime of the person crucified. The inscription was written in Hebrew/Aramaic, Latin and Greek and the place of the crucifixion was near the city (John 19:20). Thus, without his knowledge, Pilate, the gentile governor, declared to the world that Jesus was King of the Jews, even though it was in mockery.

Matthew 27:11
*Falsely accused.*
If we are going through a difficult time because we have been falsely accused of a crime, let us ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was also falsely accused of two crimes (blasphemy and treason). Jesus was scourged and crucified even though He was innocent but He forgave His offenders and shed His blood to redeem them. He is with us through all our sufferings.
Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering.

Matthew 27:21
*All together they shouted, ‚ÄúNo, not this man. WE WANT BARABBAS!‚Äù*
Who was Barabbas?
Bar-Abba means ‚Äúson of the Father‚Äù or ‚Äúson of God‚Äù, the name which the Jews had given him. He was also a criminal who had committed many crimes. Bar-Abba or Barabbas represents all of us sinners who are sons and daughters of God.

Barabbas did not even turn round and thank Jesus for saving him by going to the Cross instead of him.
Like Barabbas, when we commit sins we too are being ungrateful to Jesus for going to the Cross instead of us.

The people rejected Jesus (their true Messiah) and voted for Barabbas (the false Messiah) so Pilate gave them what they wanted (Matthew 27:17).
When we choose to live in disobedience to God, God will allow us to choose the kind of leaders we deserve, religious and political, because our leaders will be chosen from among us and our sins block us from making the right choices due to separation from God. Therefore, if we are not happy with our leaders then we need to examine ourselves, instead of judging them.

Matthew 27:22-23
*Why was Jesus killed?*
We know that Jesus died for our sins but He was not killed for our sins. The religious leaders (High Priest, Pharisees and Scribes) did not know that Jesus came to die to save us from going to Hell and even if they knew they were too proud and arrogant to accept.

*So why was Jesus killed?*
Jesus was killed because:

1. He cured a deaf and mute man which was only possible for God but, according to them, Jesus performed the miracle with the power of Satan, because they didn't accept Him as the divine Messiah.
2. He touched an untouchable person (a leper) to heal him instead of telling the man to go away and quarantine himself.
3. He healed the sick people on the Sabbath.
4. He forgave the adultress woman instead of condemning her.
5. He dined with the despised people (tax collectors and sinners) instead of avoiding them.

In view of the above acts, according to the religious leaders Jesus had become ritually unclean and therefore had to be purged out of their land and community.

If we encounter a person in need, who was despised and shunned by society, would we reach out and help them like Jesus did or would we keep safe distance like those religious leaders?
Following Jesus is not easy. We either please God or we please the world.

Matthew 27:24
*When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all, but that a riot was breaking out instead, he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying, ‚ÄúI am innocent of this man‚Äôs blood. This is your doing.‚Äù*
Pilate had the power to release Jesus but Pilate chose not to.

Have we anytime ignored any innocent people being condemned?
When we heard the news did we try to give them physical or moral support?
If it wasn‚Äôt possible then did we try to give them spiritual support by praying for them till they received justice?

If we are guilty of having washed our hands when an innocent person was condemned, and we did nothing to help that person get justice, then we are no different from Pilate.

What you did not do for the least of my brothers, you did not do for me (Matthew 25:45).

We cannot attribute the injustice only to Pilate. Every time we ignore injustice we are guilty of the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus.
Pilate did it physically, we do it spiritually.

Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent but the Jews were screaming that Jesus must be crucified. If a riot broke out then Pilate would have to give up his chair as governor and thus his luxurious life because the emperor would not tolerate chaos in the jurisdiction of the governor. Pilate was in the middle of a difficult decision. Therefore, in order to save his position, Pilate ordered Jesus to be scourged and crucified.

But it wasn't just Pilate who made this choice.
Pilate represents all those who are guilty of crucifying Jesus with their sins because they prefer to give up Jesus and cling to their earthly glory and comfortable lives.

Matthew 27:26
*So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, he handed Jesus over to be crucified.*
Pilate‚Äôs wife sent him a message to spare Jesus, but Pilate chose to hand Jesus over to be scourged and crucified, because he wanted to please the crowd.

Pontius Pilate represents all of us sinners.
So often we do the wrong things to please the world instead of doing the right things to please God and in doing so, along with Pilate, we too are guilty of the scourging and crucifixion of Jesus.

Matthew 27:26
*Denied justice.*
Have we been denied justice at any time, thus causing us and our families a lot of pain and suffering (emotional and financial)?
Have we or are we going through physical or mental torment?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this injustice willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was innocent and yet He was scourged and crucified, thus putting Him and His mother through a lot of emotional pain and suffering, but He still redeemed His offenders.

*Scourged.*
Are we suffering from pain and discomfort due to skin diseases?
Let us ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was scourged, during which His flesh was ripped off thus causing Him extreme physical pain. Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering.

Matthew 27:28-31
*Mocked at, insulted & crowned with thorns.*
Have we been criticized or insulted?
Have we been crowned with a nickname in mockery?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus too was insulted and crowned with thorns in mockery, but He still redeemed His offenders.
On the other hand, if we are suffering from any kind of headaches, brain diseases, or any other mental disorders, let us ask the Lord to help us take our cup of suffering and go through it willingly, not forgetting that Jesus was crowned with thorns which were mercilessly sunk into His scalp. Jesus went through the major suffering for our sins; He is only asking us to go through the minor suffering because without suffering we cannot enter Heaven.

Matthew 27:34
*Wine mixed with myrrh.*
If we are addicted to alcohol or drugs to drown our problems, let us ask the Lord to help us get out of this difficult addiction, not forgetting that Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh to drown His pain but He refused.

Matthew 27:35
*Humiliated by being stripped of His clothes in public.*
Have we been humiliated or stripped of our shame in any way, physically or verbally?
Let us pray for our offenders while we ask the Lord to help us go through this suffering willingly, not forgetting that Jesus too was humiliated by being stripped of His clothes in front of all the public, but He still redeemed His offenders.
Let us also pray for those who are going through this suffering and have no one to help them, and those who are not able to cover themselves sufficiently during harsh weathers, due to poverty.

Matthew 27:40
*‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶....‚Äù*
Satan had tried this same trick with Jesus around three years ago, but failed (Matthew 4:3 & 6), the same trick which he had tried with Adam & Eve with success.
Power and wealth being one of the worst human weaknesses, Satan thought that this one last time he would push Jesus to the edge and then play the same trick again for the last time, ‚Äúif you are the Son of God ‚Ä¶..‚Äù

If we have been challenged by others when we have power in our hands, let us first remember that getting us to accept a challenge after reminding us of our position or power, is not God‚Äôs way of doing things.
Let us always be alert to the tricks played by the devil through the people around us, by staying in touch with the scriptures every day.

Jesus had only a few moments before His death but Satan was still trying his luck to drag Jesus into his kingdom.
If Satan didn‚Äôt spare the Son of God till the end then we the creatures should not expect that Satan will spare us. We must therefore be alert to sin until the last moment of our lives. If we try to avoid violence, Satan will use our loved ones to lead us on his path.

Matthew 28:6
Faith in the resurrection is based on divine revelation, and not on the empty tomb. The resurrection cannot be tested or verified in a laboratory. Also, there are no eye witnesses to prove how Jesus rose from the dead and exactly what time. But there were witnesses who saw Jesus die and they also saw Him after the resurrection.

Matthew 28:12-15
It is surprising that the Jews never thought of asking how it could be possible that all soldiers fell asleep together when they were supposed to be on duty? And if all the soldiers were asleep then who saw the disciples taking the Body of Jesus?

Matthew 28:19
*‚ÄúGo therefore and make disciples of all nations ‚Ä¶..‚Äù*
Jesus didn‚Äôt make evangelization optional and Jesus was not speaking of political nations. Jesus was speaking of ethnic groups which create their own gods and their own beliefs.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù*
By this command Jesus gave us the Sacrament of Baptism to restore the divine life within us (the life of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit), which Adam and Eve had destroyed in the Garden of Eden, by making a Covenant with Satan when they committed the first mortal sin.

Matthew 28:20
*‚ÄúI will be with you always until the end of time.‚Äù*
Jesus fulfills that promise by dwelling with us in the new Covenant Tabernacles in the Church until we receive Him in Communion. Thereafter He dwells within us and gives us divine life (John 14:23) until we commit a sin.

##### Day 267 The return from exile

When the Lord wills something it will happen, just a word is spoken from the Lord and things happen. The Israelites have been in exile for 70 years ‚Äì which is a couple of generations when the Lord causes the King of Persia, Cyrus to declare freedom to the Israelites.

1 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, in order that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia so that he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom, and also in a written edict declared:
2 ‚ÄúThus says King Cyrus of Persia: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem in Judah. 3 Any of those among you who are of his people‚Äîmay their God be with them!‚Äîare now permitted to go up to Jerusalem in Judah, and rebuild the house of the Lord, the God of Israel‚Äîhe is the God who is in Jerusalem; 4 and let all survivors, in whatever place they reside, be assisted by the people of their place with silver and gold, with goods and with animals, besides freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.‚Äù Ezra 1
Can you imagine, if you were waiting on something for generations ‚Äì like immigration status and you were given the news that the President himself has granted you and your family approval? It would have been music to the ears of many, but we can also see many who had gotten used to living in exile and didn‚Äôt want to return. Can you imagine how God works, the people were asked to go back home and even given supplies and valuables ‚Äì gold and silver.
Now as the people came back and were settling down, they started contributing towards the restoration of the temple.
68 As soon as they came to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the heads of families made freewill offerings for the house of God, to erect it on its site. 69 According to their resources they gave to the building fund sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly robes. Ezra 2

As the people settled in, we see that they have forgotten about the house of the Lord. Their focus shifted to their own houses, and they have forgotten the house of the Lord.
You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the Lord of hosts. Because my house lies in ruins, while all of you hurry off to your own houses. 10 Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. 11 And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the soil produces, on human beings and animals, and on all their labors. Haggai 1

Let us always be aware of the house of the Lord, of the church‚Äôs needs, and do everything we can to support our churches. This message comes in a day and age where churches and schools are closing in the western world due to lack of attendance. Hopefully, we as a human race will wake up and return home to church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Rebuilding the Temple

[![Rebuilding the Temple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day268.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CVYwsdZYNoM "Rebuilding the Temple")

##### Day 268 Sloth

What is sloth? Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work. Physical sloth is plain and simple laziness, not wanting to do any work or study or chores. Everyone has some amount of Sloth in them, given a chance ‚Äì people would live in filth. Laziness is fueled by luxury and comfort, one does not want to get off the couch to get the house tidy. Laziness can result in families facing financial problems.

4The lazy person does not plow in season; harvest comes, and there is nothing to be found. 5 The purposes in the human mind are like deep water, but the intelligent will draw them out. Prov 20:4,5

However bad Physical sloth may be, it‚Äôs not as bad as Spiritual sloth. Spiritual Sloth can lead us to Spiritual death. One can go to Mass every Sunday and still not pray, just going through the Mass without praying is disrespectful to Jesus in the Eucharist. Jesus is present Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity in the Eucharist ‚Äì He looks forward to entering our hearts and soul every time we receive communion.

Sloth is the desire for ease, even at the expense of doing the known will of God. Whatever we do in life requires effort. Everything we do is to be a means of salvation. The slothful person is unwilling to do what God wants because of the effort it takes to do it. Sloth becomes a sin when it slows down and even brings to a halt the energy we must expend in using the means to salvation.

Sloth can prevent us from doing God‚Äôs will because we are so lazy and do not want to pray. Some people think that they will be saved by virtue of being baptized. Although we are saved by what Jesus did for us on the cross, we cannot take it for granted and do nothing. We are called to pick up our cross and follow him daily. We are called to work out our salvation with trembling. Not sit and do nothing. We are called to pray and to know the Lord. We are called to be led by the Spirit and not just be dormant.

12 Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed me, not only in my presence, but much more now in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.Phil 2

Another form of laziness is being overly busy or preoccupied with many things, that we forget to pray. Sometimes we can be so busy doing God‚Äôs work that we even forget our own salvation.
Like those folks who did many things for the Lord but didn‚Äôt really do the will of God. To know the will of God we need to have a relationship with God and spend time listening to the Holy Spirits' guidance.

21 ‚ÄúNot everyone who says to Me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‚ÄòLord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?‚Äô 23 And then I will declare to them, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!‚Äô

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 268 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 4:4-5
*Then the people of the land (the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin) discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build (the Temple). The adversaries bribed officials to frustrate the plan of the Jews throughout the reign of King Cyrus of Persia and until the reign of King Darius of Persia.*

The Judah and Benjamin tribes were doing the work of God but the enemies were not happy so they stopped the Jews from re-building the Temple.

Whenever we get busy with God‚Äôs work Satan will always stir up his disciples to either stop the work or mess it up.

But the obedience of the Jews had won God‚Äôs favour (Ezra 5:5). The issue was resolved and the work resumed.

As long as we obey God‚Äôs commandments He will always send His angels to support us so that we can continue His work, and Satan‚Äôs evil plans will be foiled.

##### Day 269 Your words and actions only expose what‚Äôs in your heart.

Even children make themselves known by their acts, by whether what they do is pure and right. Prov 20:11

This is so simple and so true, our actions reveal who we really are. We sometimes do not know who we really are, we may think we are all good and don‚Äôt need help until we mess up. But God knows us well and still loves us.

Jesus taught that the mouth speaks what the heart is full off.
43 ‚ÄúNo good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit; 44 for each tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. 45 The good person out of the good treasure of the heart produces good, and the evil person out of evil treasure produces evil; for it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaks. Luke 6:43-45

Sometimes we can put on a mask and try to be good in front of people, but our truth can never be covered up all the time. Usually, the close family knows the true nature of the person. Also, certain circumstances and situates will reveal the person.

If we like to do some self-examination, we can keep track of our words and actions and this will reveal the state of our hearts. We can also keep track of our thoughts and see know what we are thinking all the time. These will help us know who we really are and we can work on our weaknesses.

Sometimes we have a hidden nature, this nature is revealed when we have a certain opportunity or are faced with a certain situation. For example, a husband may have never imagined that he would be physically violent, but when his wife kept fighting with him, he snapped and hit her. This hidden nature is revealed, and he feels ashamed. We store a lot of good and bad memories in our subconscious mind ‚Äì which shape our personality. We sometimes struggle with certain sins because of our past, we may not even remember what happened to us as children ‚Äì but it impacts us. A good inner healing retreat will help.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #270 Two ways to trust in the Lord.

We see two different approaches that Nehemiah and Ezra take to prayer and trusting in God. Both of them had a similar situation ‚Äì they needed to journey and in the days of Kings ‚Äì one would need a small band of armed soldiers to safely travel. The two took two different approaches ‚Äì Ezra was ashamed to ask the King for protection because he said that the Lord God will protect him.

21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might deny ourselves before our God, to seek from him a safe journey for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions. 2
2 For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and cavalry to protect us against the enemy on our way, since we had told the king that the hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his power and his wrath are against all who forsake him. 23 So we fasted and petitioned our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty. Ez 8:21-23

Nehemiah goes the route of praying that the King will send a cavalry with him and it did happen, the King granted his request.

4 Then the king said to me, ‚ÄúWhat do you request?‚Äù So I prayed to the God of heaven. 5 Then I said to the king, ‚ÄúIf it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors‚Äô graves, so that I may rebuild it.‚Äù 6 The king said to me (the queen also was sitting beside him), ‚ÄúHow long will you be gone, and when will you return?‚Äù So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a date. 7 Then I said to the king, ‚ÄúIf it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may grant me passage until I arrive in Judah; 8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king‚Äôs forest, directing him to give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple fortress, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall occupy.‚Äù And the king granted me what I asked, for the gracious hand of my God was upon me.
9 Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king‚Äôs letters. Now the king had sent officers of the army and cavalry with me. Nehemiah 2: 4-9

Sometimes in life, we are faced with a situation where we need to trust the Lord. We can take either route of praying that God Himself will take care of us and we will be safe, or we could pray that God will use people in authority to keep us safe.
For example, some people could have such strong faith that they feel that God will heal them Miraculously and stop taking medicine or don‚Äôt go for surgery.
There is also another kind of people that say that God will heal them with medicines and surgery and they pray that God will guide the hands of the doctor.
Now none of us will ever know what is the right method, but all of us know that we cannot limit the way God works. God can heal us directly with a Miracle and also can use doctors and medicine to heal us.
The important thing to remember is that God is the source of everything good, as long as we trust in him ‚Äì it does not matter what route we take ‚Äì if we ask for an army or if we blindly trust the Lord to protect us.
Our Faithful God will always protect us, we need to be sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to know what route to take.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Israel's Foreign Wives

[![Israel's Foreign Wives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day271.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vxEtEDgtKQw "Israel's Foreign Wives")

##### Day #271 Is your marriage making you holier?

The person you marry, can either make you holier or lead you away from the truth. We all know that marriage is the union of two souls, the two are united not just emotionally and physically but also spiritually. Ezra was able to clearly notice how those Israelites with mixed marriages we being led away from the true God. There were several warnings from the Lord and instructions to not marry outside the Israelite community. Not that the others were second class, but the Jews were God‚Äôs chosen people, and salvation was going to come from them.

9 After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, ‚ÄúThe people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2 For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons. Thus the holy seed has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands, and in this faithlessness the officials and leaders have led the way.‚Äù 3 When I heard this, I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled. Ezra 9: 1-3

By marrying the other people -the Israelites are slowly taking on idol worship and other practices that are forbidden. They are becoming unclean and committing grave sin.

10 ‚ÄúAnd now, our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, 11 which you commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, ‚ÄòThe land that you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations. They have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.Ezra 9:10-11

It finally came to the point where Ezra commanded the Israelites to separate from their foreign wives and children. We need to pay attention that this is Ezra‚Äôs instruction ‚Äì not sure if he waited on the Lord for instruction. It was a case-by-case decision ‚Äì where they determined if the separation was needed.
Of course, God does not like divorce, it is made clear by Jesus‚Äôs own words.

8 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúMoses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.‚ÄùMat 18:8-9

So the takeaway for us is the question ‚Äì Is our marriage making us holy or taking us away from God?
God‚Äôs design is for marriage to be a small trinity, Husband-Wife-God. Children are a fruit of a good marriage. We should pray for our spouses and help them become the best version of themselves. And if your marriage is abusive or preventing you from following Christ ‚Äì the Church is always there to guide you and help you with the annulment process.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 271 By Cynthia Dsilva

Ezra 9:5-9
Ezra, in his humility, was counting himself as one among his sinful brothers even though he stayed out of mortal sin.
Like Ezra, we too must refrain from pointing our finger at the sins of others as if to say that we are sinless.

Zechariah 9:9-10
This was an image of a future king who would stop war and bring peace.
It was an image of Jesus whose power comes, not from this world but, from the Father above. Jesus will bring peace in the world, not by using force or magic, but by spreading love and mercy through His people, the Christians.

##### The Call of Nehemiah

[![The Call of Nehemiah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day272.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zbvENgoZvbw "The Call of Nehemiah")

##### Day #272 Grace not Vengeance.

When someone does something to us, the first thing that we want to do is get back at them, hurt them back or do something even eviler. An eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth makes the whole world blind. The wisdom of the proverbs calls for us to refrain from retaliating and becoming like the person who did evil in the first place.

Do not say, ‚ÄúI will repay evil‚Äù; wait for the Lord, and he will help you. Prov 22:20

We need to wait for the Lord to help us and to help the person who hurt us. If we keep doing evil for evil, this will escalate and cause a really evil world. We have to pray for God‚Äôs help so that we can do good to those who do bad to us. We should pray that we are able to bless those who curse us. Pray for the strength to turn the other cheek, walk the extra mile, and to forgive the wrongs done to us.
Forgiveness is a good idea until someone hurts you.
When someone hurts you or does wrong to you, it actually is a prayer that they are making ‚Äì by their evil actions they are making a prayer ‚Äì a prayer that says ‚ÄúHey!! I have evil in my heart, please pray that God will give me the grace to overcome it‚Äù.
So the next time you feel offended, take a breath, prayer a bit, and let God help you. Do not avenge the action but pray for God‚Äôs grace in the other person‚Äôs life.
Just as God the father, cried over the pierced one. God could have taken vengeance on the human race and wiped out every single one of us. But God had Mercy instead of Vengeance on us.

10 And I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that, when they look on the one whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. Zechariah 12:10

We should get strength when we gaze at the crucifix, strength to forgive. He was stricken for our inequities and bruised for our offenses.
May we be moved to compassion and forgiveness, not to vengeance. Let us pray for God‚Äôs grace in everyone‚Äôs life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè

##### The Lord's Work

[![The Lord's Work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day273.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2qNdSZ_oPQc "The Lord's Work")

##### Day #273 Who is my neighbor?

We seem to be stuck with a bunch of names again in Nehemiah although it may seem boring to read them, we need to remember that it was a lot of people doing the work of the Lord. Everyone decided to leave their regular work and they picked up tools to build the wall. The high priest were only supposed to offer sacrifice at the temple, they were dedicated to the service of the Lord. Yet they took up common tools to build the wall, to do the will of the Lord.
Even though we see this massive effort to rebuild the walls around Jerusalem and the whole city was involved. We also read about those nobles who thought that doing a menial task like building a wall was below their dignity.

5 Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work of their Lord. Nehemiah 3:5

We need to check our hearts and see if we are open to doing anything the Lord may call us to do.
We are called to be servants and not masters, we should be like Jesus ‚Äì who came not to be served but to serve. Let us pray that our hearts be open and willing to do any little thing the Lord asks us to do. We should be open to all tasks for example: cleaning the church floor, visiting people in prison, going out of our way to talk to the person who everyone else ignores.
We may not all be called to be great preachers and evangelists ‚Äì but are certainly called to be a witness at our workplace, home and friend circle. Let us be prepared to do anything the Lord asks of us because most of the time, these small acts of kindness are what bring people to Christ.
We also read how many people were only building the wall in front of their houses and were possibly not concerned for their neighbors or those in need.

28 Above the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each one opposite his own house. 29 After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his own house. After him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs. 30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section. After him Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.

We are living in a very ‚ÄúmeWorld‚Äù and everything revolves around my wants and needs. My house, my children, my health, my family, my car, my parish, my group, my, my, my..

Our Christian calling is to live as a community, we should not just think of ourselves all the time, or else we will be like the priest who ignored the traveler in the parable of the good Samaritan.
We will be like those in the final judgment narration who failed to see Christ in the poor, the hungry, and the naked. We will end up asking the question

‚ÄòLord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?‚Äô Mat 25:44

We will end up like the rich man who was not able to see the needs of Lazarus the poor beggar who sat hoping to get the crumbs that fell from his table.

Let us not only build the walls near our homes but build the walls of the city of God. Let us not say things like ‚Äì that‚Äôs the work of the clergy or that‚Äôs not my calling or someone else will do it.
Let us be the hands and feet of Christ, let us not hide our light under the bushel basket but set it on a high place for the people to see our light and praise our creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 273 By Cynthia Dsilva

Nehemiah 3:5
*Next to him the Tekoites carried out the work of repair; however, some of their most powerful men (the nobles) would not submit to the labor asked by their masters.*

During the re-building of the Temple the nobles would sit and dish out orders to the poor who were doing all the work, but the nobles themselves did not help with the work. They considered themselves a class higher than the poor.

The commission to preach the Gospel is for believers of all categories in every age and not only for people who are classified as lower level because in Heaven there is no class distinction.

Jesus Christ, who is God Himself, had every reason to avoid putting on human flesh, yet He humbled Himself in order to be able to taste the various hardships and sufferings of man so that He could bring salvation for men.

We therefore need to step down from our pedestal of pride, humble ourselves and be like Christ. Spiritual leaders must humble themselves and not feel that they are too big to be involved with the hard work of evangelization or to go out with their teams and bow down to help the poor and needy.

Nehemiah 3:6-32
The construction of the wall of Jerusalem was done through a long and unbroken chain. Families (large and small) who came from the outskirts as well as from the metropolis of Jerusalem, were involved in doing the whole construction. It was done through 38 leaders. Seven villages provided volunteers, and skilled & unskilled workers. The job was accomplished through a commendable team spirit. None of the professional workers allowed his/her secular work to hinder the great task of rebuilding the wall, even if it meant losing their jobs.

When God gives us a task He provides workforce, resources, etc. for getting the task accomplished. But God‚Äôs call to serve Him is not only to a selected few; it is a call to all believers in Christ. The preaching and spreading of the Gospel is also the responsibility of all believers. We are all good co-workers with Christ, but when we are committed to expanding the Kingdom of God on earth, *NOTHING* should hinder us from rendering undisturbed service to God.

##### Perseverance in Opposition

[![Perseverance in Opposition](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/September/jpgs/Day274.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RU4FW7-X7b0 "Perseverance in Opposition")

##### Day#274 Perseverance in opposition

Whenever you try to do something good you will always face opposition, people will say stuff like ‚ÄúNo it won‚Äôt work‚Äù, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be able to complete it‚Äù, ‚Äúno one will want to do it‚Äù ‚Ä¶.
The list of negative suggestions or oppositions will never end.

We read about the massive effort among the Jews to build the wall, however, this was met with great opposition.
Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he mocked the Jews. 2 He said in the presence of his associates and of the army of Samaria, ‚ÄúWhat are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish it in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish‚Äîand burned ones at that?‚Äù 3 Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, ‚ÄúThat stone wall they are building‚Äîany fox going up on it would break it down!‚Äù Neh 4: 1-3

The Jews were mocked and insulted, and they faced threats and opposition. Imagine someone saying that the wall is so weak that even a fox standing on it will break it down. Don‚Äôt we face similar oppositions when we try to do something for the Lord? Usually, the opposition is from people around us and it can really hurt and dampen our spirit.
Nehemiah had the best response to the opposition and to the threats of attack.

So we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night. Neh 4:9

He did two things

1. Pray
2. Guard.

As soon as there was opposition Nehemiah resorted to prayer.
Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their taunt back on their own heads, and give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.Neh 4:4
Guard: The workers split into two groups, one group would build the wall while the other group guarded the wall. They would swap duties working day and night until the wall was built. Some even had a sword in one hand and a construction tool in the other.

15 When our enemies heard that their plot was known to us, and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his work. 16 From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and body-armor; and the leaders posted themselves behind the whole house of Judah, 17 who were building the wall. The burden bearers carried their loads in such a way that each labored on the work with one hand and with the other held a weapon. 18 And each of the builders had his sword strapped at his side while he built.

Let us learn a life lesson here, we can use this two-step approach to face opposition.

1. Pray
2. Guard
   As soon as someone opposes us or ridicules us for our faith or mission, we should pray first. We should never give in to discouragement or despair ‚Äì we should just pray. The second thing to do is guard ourselves against these negative people. We need not even listen to such negative comments, just walk away or ask them to stop. If we are unable to get away from the opposition just stand your ground and do not give in. Guard the spiritual wall you are building from the enemy, most lies, insults, and mockery are from the devil (the father of lies).
   Let us ‚ÄúPray‚Äù and ‚ÄúGuard‚Äù and be strong in the Lord, for our God is fighting for us.
   Pray as though everything depends on God and fight as though everything depends on us(meaning - do our best).
   Let us do our best but know that God will take care of the rest.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

The king had promoted Haman to a very high rank, seating him above all his fellow officials. Thereafter all the king‚Äôs servants who were at the royal gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, as ordered by the king.

Mordecai, the Jewish guard, was also working under Haman, but he would not kneel and bow down to Haman. When his colleagues reminded him daily, he explained that, because he was a Jew and in obedience to the commandment given by God (Exodus 20:5), he could not kneel and bow down to anyone except God, even though it was the king‚Äôs order (Esther 3:2). When Haman heard about it his pride was hurt and he was filled with anger. Thereafter he started on a mission to destroy not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the land (men, women and children), and he made it look like he was destroying all the enemies of the king.

Haman had every reason to rejoice and be content due to his high ranking position in the kingdom, but he allowed pride to rule his life and it ultimately destroyed him and his entire family (Esther 9:7-10).

If we have been promoted in whichever area we serve, let us be careful to ensure that pride does not rule our lives. Whatever level we have been elevated to, let us always use it to serve others with humility.

##### Day #275 We live in a broken world

When we read the old testament with this 21st-century lens we cannot help but say that the stuff they did is just wrong. For example, the way the kings treated the queens and the concubines is just wrong.
We read about king Ahasuerus who had these banquets for his ministers, nobles, and governors, the armies of Persia and Media were also present for this really long party which lasted one hundred and eighty days.
When the king was drunk with wine, he ordered that his queen Vashti be brought out so that everyone could admire her beauty, but she refused to come out. Good for her to take a stand against the king ‚Äì even though it cost her the crown.

7 For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, since they will say, ‚ÄòKing Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.‚Äô 18 This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen‚Äôs behavior will rebel against the king‚Äôs officials, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath! 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. 20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.‚Äù
21 This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan proposed; 22 he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, declaring that every man should be master in his own house. Esther 1
In that male-dominated society, women were put down and treated like servants. Queen Vasthi was expelled from the king‚Äôs presence because of her disobedience. They needed to pick a new queen, and there is a process that can make a 21st-century audience sick.
12 The turn came for each girl to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their cosmetic treatment, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women. 13 When the girl went in to the king she was given whatever she asked for to take with her from the harem to the king‚Äôs palace.

Imagine the poor self-image those women would have had if they had to be treated for months together just so that the King can pick them. We can read this saying ‚Äì how corrupt they were but we need to check our own hearts, do we treat each other‚Äôs bodies like objects? In this pornographic age ‚Äì beauty has become ‚Äògod‚Äô ‚Äì both men and women treat their bodies like objects. People classify others based on looks, appearance and style. We have lost the true beauty of the soul. Physical beauty will fade away but a beautiful heart gets more beautiful.
Right from the start, God created both men and women equal and they were both created in the image and likeness of God. God never wanted the Kings to have many wives and concubines. In fact, as we read many times over - God forbid the kings of Israel from having many wives. Most of the Jewish kings met their downfall because of their many wives and their disobedience to God.

Let us thank God for the progress we have made when it comes to respecting women. We in the 21st century may criticize the Old Testament people, but are our hearts clean of corruption?
Do we look at Jesus present in our brothers and sisters?

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Haman's Plan

[![Haman's Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day276.jpg)](https://youtu.be/94bkfSB7XCM "Haman's Plan")

##### Day #276 Take a stance for what is right.

Ester 3:1-2 ‚ÄúMordecai Refuses To Honor Haman. Sometime later, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, giving him a higher rank and seating him above all his royal nobles. All the royal officials who were at the king‚Äôs gate would kneel down and render homage to Haman, for that is what the king had ordered to be done toward him. But Mordecai refused to kneel and bow down to him.‚Äù
Mordecai‚Äôs refusal to kneel did not sit well with Haman. Haman came up with a plan to wipe out the Jews. Based on Haman‚Äôs advice King Ahasuerus send out a decree to kill all those who did not abide by the kingdom ordinances, specifically the Jews. King Ahasuerus wants to have peace and tranquility in the kingdom at any cost.
Although we may never need to kill someone who does not agree with us, we may exclude and alienate them. We sometimes like to live in a shell ‚Äì where we allow on those who agree with us or keep things that make us happy. We may want to throw out church teachings, commandments and laws that we don‚Äôt like and live according to what gives ‚Äúus‚Äù peace or makes us happy. We may want to even distance ourselves from people who reveal our truth or who correct us and keep us on track.

A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. Prov 21:6

We sometimes try to get peace from earthly securities like our bank balance, our position in society or influential friends or family. We try to gain a fortune in any way possible by lying or cheating others ‚Äì let us remember this will not bring us peace.
We are willing at times to make a comprise of our faith and beliefs just so that we can fit into society or gain money. Let us learn from Mordecai and take a stance for the truth even if it will cost us something. We will have true peace and deliverance when we stand for the truth and do what is right in the eyes of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Nehemiah 8:2‚Äì10
After the Babylonians were defeated by the Persians, King Cyrus of Persia decreed that the Jews who were exiled (from 587 to 537 BC) could return home to Jerusalem.¬† They rebuilt their ruined temple (Ezra 6:15‚Äì17) and under Nehemiah finished rebuilding the city walls (Nehemiah 6:15) around 450 BC.

During this time, God raised Ezra and commissioned him to go to Jerusalem and preach to the people. Ezra was a Scribe and a Priest (v.1, 2 & 9) who had studied the Law at one of the schools of the Jewish Scribes in Babylon.¬† This is first time we hear of a wooden platform (pulpit) in the Temple (v.4).

The Book of Nehemiah gives us a glimpse of the details of the liturgical service of the old Covenant.

Ezra, the Priest, was conducting a liturgical service.¬† He read the Law (the Word of God), it was explained to the congregation, then they celebrated with a sacrificial meal.

This was a prototype or shadow of the liturgical service (the Mass) of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, during the liturgical service the Priest reads the Gospel (the Word of God), explains it to the congregation, teaches them how to apply it to their lives and then they celebrate with the sacrificial meal (Communion).

*Ezra read the Law from early morning to midday (six hours)* (v.3).

The people were so hungry for the Word of God that they didn‚Äôt mind sitting in the Temple for six hours to hear it (v.3).

*When Ezra opened the scroll, all the people stood up* (v.5).

When the Priest reads the Gospel during Mass, the congregation stands to hear the Word of God in reverence because the Priest is reading the message from our God and heavenly King (Jesus).

*At the end of the Reading, the people answered ‚ÄúAmen, amen‚Äù* (v.6).

At the end of the Readings when we give a positive response to the Word of God (v.6) (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ, etc.) we are swearing to God that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7).¬† Saying ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù and doing otherwise means we are breaking our oath.

*After the Law (the Word of God) was read, the Priests interpreted the Law to help the people understand, while the people remained sitting* (v.7-8).

After the 3 readings and Gospel are read in Church, the congregation sits to hear the Priest interpret the Gospel and explain how the New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is revealed in the New, and how we can apply it to our lives.

*When the people heard the Law and the consequences for disobedience, they wept because they realized how far they had gone from God due to no one being available to read the Law to them.¬† They understood that they themselves were responsible for their exile due to their sins (v.9).*

When a person realizes that he/she has been walking in the wrong direction, and repents, it is normal for him/her to cry because that is the time the Holy Spirit is activated and therefore the evil spirits must leave the soul, thus causing some reaction.

*But Ezra and the Levites consoled the people that this was not a time for weeping and grieving. They had renewed their Covenant with God during the liturgical service, so it was a time for rejoicing* (v.9).

In the New Covenant Church also, after our venial sins are forgiven and after we have heard the Word of God and offered the divine sacrifice (the Lamb of God), we are covered with white robes because we have renewed our Covenant with God.¬† It is therefore not a time for us to weep or grieve over our past sins.¬† It is a time for rejoicing with the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal.

*Ezra and the priests advised the people to share the sacrificial meal* (v.10).

In the New Covenant Church also, the priests must ensure to share the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal with those who are not able to attend the liturgical service (the elderly, the sick, the disabled, etc.).¬† However, it is the duty of the lay congregation to inform the priests of any such persons so that Communion can be given to them at their homes.

Although the Judeans rebuilt the Temple, their knowledge of the faith was very poor because there was no one to read the Word of God to them so the people had not heard the Word of God for many years. Moreover, they did not have access to the written Word of God, because copying and printing was not very common in those days.

But 2500 years later, in today‚Äôs world we are blessed to have so many ways to read the Word of God. We have hard copies, online text Bibles, online audio Bibles, etc. So let us not waste this opportunity which God has given us to have access to His Word. Let us make use of it as much as we can before it is too late.

[![Such a Time as This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day277.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z3UE1ws8JtU "Such a Time as This")

##### Day #277 Pray hard in times of trouble.

The Jews face being wiped out and there seems to be no way out as King Ahasuerus already passed the ordinance to kill anyone who does not comply. Mordecai is such a good example of not backing off when the enemy threatens. He and the other Jews resort to mourning and prayer.

When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the king‚Äôs gate, for no one might enter the king‚Äôs gate clothed with sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king‚Äôs command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. Esther 4:4

Mordecai also requested that queen Esther make supplications on behalf of the Jews. However it was not permitted for queen Ester to approach the king unless she was called. In that province, if anyone went to the King without being called they could face death.
This information did not deter Mordecai, he went on to remind Queen Esther.

‚ÄúDo not think that in the king‚Äôs palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father‚Äôs family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.‚Äù Esther 4:13,14

This advice gave Esther courage and she agreed to this difficult calling.
‚ÄúGo, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.‚Äù Esther 4:16

When we face tough situations we may want to run away or ignore it, but we should pray hard and face them instead. We should not just think about ourselves but about everyone else as well. We may be filled with fear but we should surrender our fear to the Lord and realize our current position and calling in life, maybe we were born for such a time as this. Maybe God has put us in a position so that we can help God‚Äôs people. Let us not fear to take a stand for the truth, even if it may cost our lives. We cannot do it on our own, we have to pray and surrender like Esther who prayed for 3 days before she approached the King.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Esther 6:1-11

Mordecai was not given honor for saving the King's life (Esther 2:21-23) but Mordecai being a humble man, did not complain or do anything to remind the king about it.¬† He continued doing his gatekeeper‚Äôs duty and focused on worshipping the living God and would not let anyone change that for him. God saw his heart for almost 7 years and then took the necessary action to shower Mordecai with blessings.

God allowed Haman to make the ungodly command that all his subordinates must kneel and bow down to him, because God wanted to test Mordecai's faithfulness.

God allows the ungodly ones to make evil plots against His people to spiritually heal the good ones or to glorify the holy ones.

For the Lord will raise the humble, but the haughty eyes He will bring down. (Psalm 18:27).

When we obey the devil our physical destruction may or may not happen but our eternal destruction is definite.

We get whatever we give others and whatever we wish for others.

Let us therefore spread love and compassion, wherever we go, and wish the prosperity of others.

Let us avoid spreading anger, hatred and envy, and wishing the destruction of others.

Esther 6:13
*Haman‚Äôs wife and friends said to him, ‚ÄúIf Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him.‚Äù*

He, who had planned the destruction of God‚Äôs faithful people and their families, himself met with destruction along with his family.

God has sent each one of His chosen people to the earth with a mission, but Satan always stirs up his disciples to plant obstacles or to destroy the mission.¬† Those who plot to destroy God's people before His mission is accomplished, will meet their own destruction.¬† It is for God to decide when we should leave the earth. Satan cannot destroy us (body and soul) if we allow God to control our lives and remain obedient to His commandments.¬† That is not a guarantee for a long life.¬† It just means that we will have sufficient time to accomplish the mission which God assigned to us for the growth of His Kingdom on earth (the Church), and God will be with us all the way through.

When God is for us, no one can be against us (Romans 8:31), and no weapon fashioned against us shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17), but God will be for us only if we obey Him.

##### Power in Weakness

[![Power in Weakness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day278.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z-VCoqUsnS0 "Power in Weakness")

##### Day #278 When we are weak He is strong.

After praying for 3 days, Queen Esther surrendered everything to God and went to meet the king adorned in splendor.

‚Äú She was radiant with perfect beauty, and she looked happy, as if beloved, but her heart was frozen with fear. 6 When she had gone through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones. He was most terrifying.
7 Lifting his face, flushed with splendor, he looked at her in fierce anger. The queen faltered, and turned pale and faint, and collapsed on the head of the maid who went in front of her. 8 Then God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself. He comforted her with soothing words, and said to her, 9 ‚ÄúWhat is it, Esther? I am your husband. Take courage; 10 You shall not die, for our law applies only to our subjects. Come near.‚Äù Esther 15:5-10

God came to her assistance and saved Queen Esther, what her beauty could not do God did. Had the Lord not intervened and changed the heart of the King, Queen Esther would have lost her life as that was the law of the Kingdom that anyone who appears before the king without his permission would die.

We can be assured that the God who saved Queen Esther and the Israelites will also save us. We need to trust in God and surrender every situation to his providence. God will come through when our earthly ability and strength fails. He will never let us suffer beyond our ability. When we are weak He is strong, His grace is sufficient for us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

Esther 8:8
*The king said to Queen Esther, ‚ÄúYou may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king‚Äôs ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king‚Äôs ring cannot be revoked.‚Äù*

Haman managed to convince the king that all the Jews must be destroyed because they were not obeying the king‚Äôs laws and therefore there was no reason for the king to tolerate them (Esther 3:8-9); and the king agreed. Haman did this to take revenge on Mordecai for not bowing down to him (Esther 3:5-6).

When we are in the midst of a negative and difficult situation we are usually faced with a difficult choice; one would be God‚Äôs way and the other would be the devil‚Äôs way. God does not intervene in the situation until we make our choice according to His Will.

If we choose to follow God‚Äôs way, irrespective of what the consequences may be, only then God will intervene and steer the situation in our favor according to His plan.
If we choose to go the devil‚Äôs way, then God will NOT intervene and we will meet our destruction, if not in this world then definitely in the next world.

When the people of Israel were going to face a death penalty, Esther was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let her people die, OR
2. to risk her life to save her nation.

Esther made an unselfish choice. She knew that if she went to the king‚Äôs inner court without being called by the king, she could be put to death (Esther 4:11). Esther, however, did not care about her own comfort and safety. She decided she would risk her life to save her nation. She chose Option 2 (Esther 4:16). God was pleased and intervened to save her nation from annihilation. As a result many non-Jews converted to Judaism (Esther 8:17).

If Esther had chosen Option 1, then she may have been safe temporarily, but eventually she too would have perished along with her people according to the decree.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

When the world was going to face the eternal death penalty (Hell), due to original sin, Mary was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let the world perish, OR
2. to risk her life to save the world.

Like Esther, Mary made an unselfish choice. She chose option 2.
Mary risked her life to bear a child when she was still unmarried, knowing that she could be stoned to death according to the Mosaic Law. But Mary did not care about her own comfort and safety. She was more concerned about the redemption of the world and she knew how important it was for God. She therefore chose to do God‚Äôs Will. God was pleased and intervened to send an angel to speak to Joseph to accept Mary as his wife so that she could be saved from being stoned. Thereafter God sent His Son to save the world from eternal damnation. As a result many Jews and non-Jews converted to Christianity.

If we are faced with a difficult decision to choose between benefits or safety of ourselves and that of others, let us make unselfish choices, like Esther and Mary, so that we may be blessed along with the others.

*Thank you, mamma Mary, for your unconditional ‚Äúyes.*‚Äù

##### Day #279 Live life in moderation.

We live in a consumeristic and materialistic world today, where everyone is in a race to get the best. Most of the conversations revolve around the best cars, gadgets, makeup, and house. People boast about the holidays they took or how much they spent on destination weddings. This generation wants the most extravagant experiences, the most lavish travel, comfort and luxuries are all we seek after. We want to satisfy all the senses and are focused on this world more than eternal life.

Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.
18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.
19 Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
20 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. Prov 21:17-20

Today‚Äôs proverb helps us keep our appetites in check, we should not be lovers of pleasure if not we will end up becoming poor ‚Äì both financially and spiritually. It‚Äôs better to live in a desert than with a spouse who wants materialistic stuff and keeps on nagging and complaining until it's provided, BTW it‚Äôs not just the wife who nags. ü§£

The wise store up riches and save for the future, the foolish burn holes in their credit cards and get into debt. We should learn from the St Benedict and live a balanced life.
St. Benedict also displayed a spirit of moderation. His monks are allowed clothes suited to the climate, sufficient food and sufficient sleep (7 1/2‚Äì8 hours). The working day is divided into three roughly equal portions: five to six hours of liturgical and other prayer; five hours of manual work, whether domestic work, craft work, garden work, or fieldwork; and four hours reading of the Scriptures and spiritual writings. This balance of prayer, work, and study is another of Benedict‚Äôs
Let us be like wise people, work-eat-live-sleep-save-spend in moderation. Love the Lord and our families in excess, build up treasures for ourselves that moths and rust can‚Äôt destroy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day #280 Days of Remembrance

Most human beings have a problem of forgetting, we forget birthdays and anniversaries. Apart from forgetting dates we even forget the blessings, mercies, and love of the Lord. We should consider ourselves blessed as the mother church reminds us of the important things. We have feast days, memorials, solemnities, and Holy days of obligation. We have ordinary times and then we have Seasons like Advent, Lent, Easter, and Christmas. If we ever wondered why they were needed every year, one answer could be to help us remember and another answer could be so that we can go deeper in our understanding and love of them.
The Catholic church did not invent this process of remembering things, we just do as the Jewish people did. The feasts and memorials were set up as per God‚Äôs direction.
We read about the feast of `Purim` which reminds them of God‚Äôs intervention, God saved His people, rescued them from death and vindicated them.
So the next them we feel that repeating feasts and seasons is redundant let us dig deeper and immerse ourselves more and more into the life of the church, the sacraments, and the liturgy.
Didn‚Äôt Jesus as us to remember Him in the breaking of the bread?
And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‚ÄúThis is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù Luke 22:19

Even the followers of Jesus devoted themselves to remembering the Lord in the Eucharist and in the teachings of the Lord.
They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. Acts 2:42
Hope this inspires all of us to frequent the sacraments and study his word more.

##### Good and Evil

[![Good and Evil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day281.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NWGQu2xBNqU "Good and Evil")

##### Day #281 Does God really love us?

There are some fundamental questions that every human being across every generation asks of God. Even though the Bible has a lot of verses on God‚Äôs love we tend to doubt His love.
‚ÄúI have loved you,‚Äù says the Lord.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have you loved us?‚Äô Malachi 1:2

The world would say, ‚ÄúIf God loves us He would let us do what we want‚Äù Or ‚ÄúIf God loves us he would not let any suffering come into the world‚Äù. We need to realize that God has a plan for us a plan for us to be united with Him, for even if we have everything we want in this world we will not be satisfied we will only be satisfied if we rest in God.
Instead of serving that Lord with all their hearts, the priest at the time of prophet Malachi were corrupt and defiled the worship of God.

‚ÄúIt is you priests who show contempt for my name.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have we shown contempt for your name?‚Äô
7 ‚ÄúBy offering defiled food on my altar.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have we defiled you?‚Äô Malachi 1:6

It‚Äôs not just the priests but also marriages were not kept sacred. First of all the people were marrying foreign wives and the children were learning idol worship. Also, divorce was rampant and immortality was on the rise.
For I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and covering one‚Äôs garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless. Malachi 2:16

It seemed that humanity would never be able to redeem itself as we had dug ourselves into this rabbit hole of selfishness.

The last prophet before John the Baptist, Malachi reveals God‚Äôs plan to redeem humanity.

5 Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. 6 He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse. Mal 4:5

Here is the prophecy of John the Baptist and his role in preparing the way of the Lord. John proclaims that the Kingdom of God is at hand, that the redeemer of the world is coming with healing in his wings, that the sun of righteousness will rise and we will have a new covenant with holy priest offering a holy Sacrifice of the Mass and with Marriages where there is love and holiness.
The question we need to ask ourselves is ‚ÄúHas the world really changed, does my life reflect God‚Äôs love, are our priests serving the Lord with a pure heart, are marriages holy, is there divorce today because we read from Malachi that God hates divorce.‚Äù
Let us prepare for the second coming of Christ, the Church asks us to prepare for it every time we are called to repentance. We hear John the Baptist cry to prepare the way of the Lord every Advent and Lent. Let those who have ears hear!!!

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Malachi 2:1-3
*And now, O priests, this command is for you. If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart. I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.*

God was warning the priests because His priesthood was defiled.
God was also warning the married couples because the priests of the old Covenant were married men and, along with their priesthood, their marriages were also defiled.
Like marriage, the Covenant with the priesthood was to be a lifetime bond, but the priests had become lukewarm in their duties. They compromised with the Word of God to please the people.
This was a warning for all priests unto the end of time.

If the priests continue in their ungodly practices then God will discard them from His Kingdom like the dung from the sin offerings (Exodus 29:14).

Malachi 3:1
*Behold, I send my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father before the coming of the new Israel (Jesus) who would lead His people in the new exodus (Mark/1/2) towards the promised land (Heaven).

Jesus suddenly came to His Temple, without any public announcement, on the days He was to be circumcised and presented, and Simeon & Anna recognized Him (Luke 2:21-38).

Malachi 3:13-15
*You have spoken harsh words against me, says the LORD.*
*You ask, ‚ÄúWhat have we spoken against you?‚Äù*
*You have said, ‚ÄúIt is useless to serve God; what do we gain by observing God‚Äôs requirements, and by going about as mourners before the LORD of hosts? We call the arrogant blessed; for evildoers not only prosper but even test God and escape.‚Äù*

Like those people, we too can get caught up in the circle of questioning God when things are constantly going wrong in our lives, inspite of obeying God always, while the ungodly ones seem to be prospering.

##### Day 282 Patient Endurance

Life can be tough and we will have many opportunities to lose our cool. We can get angry and frustrated, resulting in hasty decisions or even harmful actions. We read some wise words from Sirach which can help us in times of anger.

Unjust anger cannot be justified, for anger tips the scale to one‚Äôs ruin. Those who are patient stay calm until the right moment, and then cheerfulness comes back to them. They hold back their words until the right moment; then the lips of many tell of their good sense. Sirach 1:22-24

We need to be patient and clam and wait for the right moment which is easier said than done. The Fear of the Lord can help us in times of anguish.

For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline, fidelity and humility are his delight. Sirach 1:27
The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish Sirach 1:18

The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, and gladness and a crown of rejoicing. 12 The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives gladness and joy and long life. Sirach 1: 11-13

The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a haughty person will find it hard to experience wisdom. The Fear of the Lord isn‚Äôt us getting afraid of God but it‚Äôs being afraid of offending the Lord with our sin. The next time we get angry imagine that Jesus is there in place of the person we are angry with and see if we are able to say the same things to them.
The Fear of the Lord drives out all fear of the world. Like some of the Jews that we read about in 1 Maccabees who did not fear being persecuted. Alexander the great died and gave his 4 generals authority, they wanted to setup pagan religions and forced the Jews to accept it. Some Jews gladly accepted it while other decided to endure the suffering they were put to, suffering unto death.
We are called to be people of patient endurance. We are to love the Fear of the Lord so we will be able overcome the fear of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Mattathias Attacks

[![Mattathias Attacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day283.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Hb1pUfIbetw "Mattathias Attacks")

##### Day #283 Zeal and righteous anger

THROUGH THE GENERATIONS THERE ARE SO MANY HEROES IN THE BIBLE WHO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, THE ZEAL FOR THE LAW OR FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD CONSUMES THEM AND THEY ARE FILLED WITH RIGHTEOUS ANGER. WE SEE ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IN MATTATHIAS, A PRIEST WHO SAW THE BLASPHEMIES BEING COMMITTED BY SOME OF THE JEWS UNDER THE GREEK RULE. IN ORDER TO PLEASE THE KING AND HAVE A GOOD LIFE THEY DECIDED TO PARTAKE IN PAGAN WORSHIP.
The King's officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town where Mattathias lived and suggested that he partake in the pagan worship.
‚ÄúYou are a leader, honored and great in this town, and supported by sons and brothers. 18 Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the nations and the people of Judah and those who are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.‚Äù 1 Maccabees 2:17-18

Mattathias would not cave in to such temptations but the zeal within him would grow stronger.

9 But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: ‚ÄúEven if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him and have chosen to obey his commandments, every one of them abandoning the religion of their ancestors, 20 I and my sons and my brothers will continue to live by the covenant of our ancestors. 21 Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances. 22 We will not obey the king‚Äôs words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.‚Äù
23 When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein, according to the king‚Äôs command. 24 When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal, and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and slaughtered him on the altar. 25 At the same time he killed the king‚Äôs officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar. 26 Thus he burned with zeal for the law, just as Phinehas did against Zimri son of Salu. 1 Maccabees 2: 9-26

Let us try to put ourselves in his shoes or one second, would we cave in or run away or would we fight like him. He was fearless and did not let any pressures or temptations of the world deter him, he was filled with righteous anger. Does this not remind you of Jesus cleansing of the temple of the money changers.
‚Äúzeal for your house will consume me‚Äù in John 2:17

Then Mattathias cried out in the town with a loud voice, saying: ‚ÄúLet everyone who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!‚Äù 28 Then he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the town. At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there, 30 they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them. Maccabees 2:27-30

Mattathias was that spark the set the fire of Zeal in many people and they were able to withstand the persecution, even fight for the right of worship.
May we be feel inspired to take a stance for the Lord, may the zeal of righteous anger fill our hearts and minds as we read these stories of these heroes in the Bible.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

#### BIAY Day 283 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Maccabees 2:15-22
It would have been more easier for Mattathias and his family to maintain their peace and become wealthy by obeying the evil king. But they chose to obey the true heavenly King and resist the earthly king so they revolted against Antiochus and eventually won the battle 3 years later.

Let us make sure that we too have the same zeal for the Lord so that we resist evil even if it means we have to give up our wealth and comfort.

1 Maccabees 2:62
*Do not fear the words of sinners, for their splendour will turn into dung and worms.*
Whenever we receive hurtful comments (criticism, humiliation, threats, etc.) from others, let us remember that there is a Word of God for us.
We must just brush off any type of comment that hurts or wounds us, for these are the words of those who obey the evil one and they have no power over us. If we are still holding onto hurtful words, let us let-go and pray for the person who used them. Their words will never have any impact on us, and their words will never have authority over us. We are children of God, so we need not fear the words of sinners.

Sirach 4:26
*Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, and do not try to stop the current of a river.*
A flowing river is a symbol of God‚Äôs flowing grace. When we don't confess our sins we block the inward flow of grace into our lives. An honest confession opens the floodgates of Heaven.

##### Near Occasion of Sin

[![Near Occasion of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day284.jpg)](https://youtu.be/34gZvSG-cTk "Near Occasion of Sin")

##### Day 284 Guard yourself against lust and avoid the near occasion of Sin.

Sirach has some good advice for anyone struggling with the sin of lust. It seems to be addressing a man but as we know most of the Bible is written with a masculine perspective but that was just how things were written back then. This advice is relevant for both genders, especially in our modern-day lifestyle. And Sirach was a book written by a father to his son, giving him a lot of advice about living a virtuous life.

Do not go near a loose woman,
or you may fall into her snares.
4 Do not dally with a female singer,
or you may be caught in her activities.
5 Do not look intently at a virgin,
or you may stumble and incur penalties for her.
6 Do not give yourself to prostitutes,
or you may lose your inheritance.
7 Do not look around in the streets of a city
or wander about in its deserted sections.
8 Turn away your eyes from a shapely woman,
and do not gaze at beauty belonging to another;
many have been seduced by a woman‚Äôs beauty,
and by it passion is kindled like a fire.
9 Never dine with another man‚Äôs wife
or revel with her at wine,
or your heart may turn aside to her,
and in blood you may plunge into destruction. Sirach 9:3-9

There advice given to us here is very practical and apt to the lifestyle that is portrayed in Media. Many TV soaps and movies portray extra marital affairs as glorious and pre-marital live in relationships a norm. Scenes like ‚Äúa man and women walk into a bar meet for the first time and end up in bed‚Äù, has caused the younger generation to think that has perverted the marital act as a pleasure seeking activity.
Unlike the times when Sirach was written where people had to go out in the streets to look for opportunities to lust, our generation has this at the finger tips ‚Äì the internet has allowed for anyone to access any content they wish. As parents and guardians we need to setup parental controls and boundaries for our younger eyes. Not just the younger eyes but for everyone, we are to avoid the near occasion of sin.

There is some good advice for married people as well to avoid wine and dine with other women or another mans wives or another woman‚Äôs husband.

9 Never dine with another man‚Äôs wife
or revel with her at wine,
or your heart may turn aside to her,
and in blood you may plunge into destruction. Sir 9:9

The Media is polluting minds by showing martial affairs as desirable, and cheating seems to be prevalent. This has caused a high divorce rate and society has made it the norm, re-marrying does not seem to help as people end up trying a few marriages and then finally give up on the idea of marriage.
Many good willing married people seem to fall into the trap of prostitution just because they did not guard themselves well. The advice ‚Äúto not go near loose women ‚Äú from Sirach is apt as no man or woman in an intoxicated state when given an opportunity to indulge in sexual activity can resist. Even the most good willing spouse will succumb to this temptation because we are all weak human beings and the flesh is very weak. The only way is to pray and avoid these evil opportunities.
The next time someone invites you to a party where you know there is a lot of drinking or to a bar that is in a shady part of town, just politely decline.
But always remember God‚Äôs Mercy is available to you if feel convicted of any sin in your thoughts, words, or deeds. Like we pray in the act of contrition ‚Äì let us avoid the near occasion of sin.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Story of Hanukkah

[![Story of Hanukkah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day285.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JZCJsc-Lt-E "Story of Hanukkah")

##### Day 285 Do not be boastful.

We can sometime become boastful about the stuff we have or our accomplishments. Almost every commercial is encouraging us to buy a better car, house or appliances. In order to keep up with the world we are trying to get slimmer, prettier, better hair or skin.
You must have heard the term ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù ‚Äì loosely put - people are doing something in order to show that they have as much money as other people, rather than because they really want to do it. Many have gone to their ruin because of keeping up with others. Instead we should just live by our means and not compare with our neighbor.
Do not make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,
and do not extol yourself when you are in difficulty.
Better those who work and have plenty
than those who boast and lack bread.
My child, honor yourself with humility
and give yourself the esteem you deserve. Sirach 10:26-28

Let us not make a display of our accomplishments but clothe ourselves with humility instead. They say pride goes before a fall, so stay humble and give the glory to God.
We also should not honor people who are rich or good good-looking or popular but those who fear the Lord and live a life of faith.
Do not praise individuals for their good looks or loathe anyone because of appearance alone. Sir 11:2

Many rulers have been utterly disgraced, and the honored have been handed over to others. Sir 11:6

We should not praise and honor only those in power or the rich and popular so the Lord can change their fortunes overnight. Instead praise those who fear the Lord or serve the poor, like Mother Teresa or any other saint that only honors God.
Whose offspring are worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![The Battle to Choose God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day286.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0OxsyVxbCEM "The Battle to Choose God")

##### Day 286 Self-care is choosing Life.

In the race of life, some people end up sacrificing a lot of their lives in the pursuit of making it big in life. Some have a good intention to make life easy for their kids and end up depriving themselves of a good life.
Whoever accumulates by depriving himself, accumulates for others; and others will live in luxury on his goods.
If a man is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous? He will not enjoy his own riches. Sirach 14:4,5
We should have a good balance between saving and spending, without overdoing either of them. We should take good care of our health as well, many people neglect their health and work 2 or 3 jobs to increase their wealth. Also, we have made our lives overly busy with many unwanted things. We set very high living standards for ourselves and end up struggling to pay off our debt.
My son treat yourself well, according to your means, and present worthy offerings to the Lord. Sirach 14: 11
It‚Äôs easier said than done, we should spend according to our means. If we could just follow this simple rule in life, we would never be envious or jealous of others.
Do not lift a weight too heavy for you,
or associate with anyone wealthier than you.
How can the clay pot go with the metal cauldron?
When they knock together, the pot will be smashed: Sirach 13:2
Let us remember that God provides for us and supplies all our needs, not our wants. We are given the freedom to choose let us choose good.
If you choose, you can keep the commandments, and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice. He has placed before you fire and water; stretch out your hand for whichever you choose. Before each person are life and death, and whichever one chooses will be given. Sirach 15:15-17
I pray that each one of us will be able to choose life, the good Christian life of moderation of earthly goods. We should store up riches in heaven and leave our children with a rich inheritance of good values and a Christian life.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Eleazar's Sacrifice

[![Eleazar's Sacrifice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day287.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SmO0KJZi4R8 "Eleazar's Sacrifice")

##### 287 Loved one‚Äôs not choosing Christ.

The number one concern parents have is their children are not prayerful and are not living a holy life. It can be frustrating to see your kids go astray and make wrong choices in life. Sometimes parents feel as though it would have been better if this prodigal child had never been born in the first place.

Do not yearn for worthless children,
or rejoice in wicked offspring.
Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them
if they do not have fear of the LORD.
Do not count on long life for them,
or have any hope for their future.
For one can be better than a thousand;
rather die childless than have impious children! Sirach 16: 1-3

We see the strong language used here in the Proverbs and may feel that the father in the proverb is too harsh. But I think it can be justified that the father truly wants the good of the child, he wants the child to do good and to have a good future. This is not just applicable for children but can be extended to any relationship, sometimes the children are in the Lord and the parents are away, many a times its one spouse in the Lord and the other one in the world.
Life can get very frustrating when we don‚Äôt see a child, spouse, parent, sibling or friend turning away from the Lord. It can be very painful to see a loved one trapped in addictions and lured into the traps of the world. We may reach a point of depression when we look at them ruin their lives, but we are called to have hope, hope against hope trusting God with every situation and every person. We have to take on the heart of the Father of the prodigal son who waits everyday for his son‚Äôs return. We are to pray and be open to God‚Äôs grace, hoping that the loved one will turn back to the Lord. Let us remember that God waits with us for them, we are not on our own but are partnering with God when we give someone a second chance. Let us ask great saints like St Monica to pray for us to be able to wait for others to change, remember waiting is loving.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Battling Against Gossip

[![Battling Against Gossip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day288.jpg)](https://youtu.be/u7P60ZXtjQU "Battling Against Gossip")

##### Day 288 Let anything you hear die with you; never fear, it will not make you burst

We all know someone or many people who struggle with the sin of gossip. There are folks who cannot stomach a secret or can‚Äôt even rest until they tell someone the gossip. Just reading Sirach will make you laugh when you think of gossipmongers.
Tell nothing to friend or foe;
and unless it be a sin for you, do not reveal a thing.
For someone may have heard you and watched you,
and in time come to hate you.
Let anything you hear die with you;
never fear, it will not make you burst!
Having heard something, the fool goes into labor,
like a woman giving birth to a child.
Like an arrow stuck in a fool‚Äôs thigh,
so is gossip in the belly of a fool. Sirach 19: 8-12
When you hear something confidential, or bad about a person try your best to not tell anyone unless it‚Äôs a sin to keep it to yourself. Just try not to say anything it may cause more ruin to that person. Come on, you won‚Äôt burst open don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre in labor and just have to deliver this gossip. Only a fool cannot hold gossip in any smart person will take it in from one ear and send it out the other. The better option would be to even step away from conversations that are not healthy.
So what should we do if we find out that someone has said something bad about us. We should first of all not reach until we investigate if it was actually true. We should go straight to the person who supposedly said something about you and talk to them directly to sort out the matter.
Admonish your friend‚Äîhe may not have done it;
and if he did, that he may not do it again.e
Admonish your neighbor‚Äîhe may not have said it;
and if he did, that he may not say it again.
Admonish your friend‚Äîoften it may be slander;
do not believe every story. Sirach 19:13-15
If we approach them directly there can be 3 positive outcomes

1. They may never say it or do it again

2. They may have never said it in the first place

3. They may apologize and we have made the friendship stronger.
   Let us try our best to avoid all gossip and to resort to speaking openly and directly to our friends and family. This will cause a much better society where everyone is built up and encouraged not slandered and brought down.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 289 No one sees me sin.

When someone wants to commit sin they usually want to cover it up, no one wants the world to know that they are evil. We can try to hide from the world but the Lord‚Äôs eyes are a thousand times brighter than the sun.

The man who dishonors his marriage bed
says to himself, ‚ÄúWho can see me?
Darkness surrounds me, walls hide me,
no one sees me. Who can stop me from sinning?‚Äù
He is not mindful of the Most High,
fearing only human eyes.
He does not realize that the eyes of the Lord,
ten thousand times brighter than the sun,
Observe every step taken
and peer into hidden corners.
The one who knows all things before they exist
still knows them all after they are made. Sirach 23:18-20

We have to remember that God observes every step we take, the God who knows all things before they exist also knows everything about them after they are made. God‚Äôs knowledge of us in unimaginable, He knows when we sit down, rise up, come in and go out, even before a word is on our lips God already knows it. Where can we go from His presence, if we go up to the heavens He is there if we go down to the deepest pit God is there. (Ps 139)

With the realization that God is everywhere we have to watch our actions, given that God knows every word of ours we also have to watch our language.

Do not accustom your mouth to coarse talk,
for it involves sinful speech.
Those accustomed to using abusive language
will never acquire discipline as long as they live. Sirach 23:13,15

Many people have made a habit to curse and use abusive language almost all the time. The explanation they provide is we are all grown-ups so it‚Äôs okay to curse. It‚Äôs not okay to abuse anyone or anything with your language as God is the creator of everyone and God is listening to every word we say.
We should correct our kids when they use abusive language as well as it is easier to correct things at an early stage, before it becomes a bad habit.

‚ÄúAn undisciplined child is a disgrace to its father‚Äù Sirach 22:3

##### Day 290 Good things in life

Our society has gotten us thinking that the good things in life are a good house, a good job, a car, a big bank balance, status in life etc. All of these are good and everyone should in moderation aim to get them. However, there are more important things than this it‚Äôs called a relationship.
With three things I am delighted,
for they are pleasing to the Lord and to human beings:
Harmony among relatives, friendship among neighbors,
and a wife and a husband living happily together. Sirach 25:1

When we talk about relationships the most important ones are 1. Family 2. Community and 3. spouse. not in any order.

Many families are divided, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, and in-laws are not talking to each other and can‚Äôt even be in the same room. There seems to be a lot of unrest in communities these days, with people forming groups, exclusion, enmity, fights, and the like.
Even the most precious relationship of a husband and wife seems to be broken sometimes. One tries to dominate the other or is driven by personal gain.
I would rather live with a dragon or a lion
than live with a wicked woman.
A woman‚Äôs wicked disposition changes her appearance,
and makes her face as dark as a bear.
When her husband sits among his neighbors,
a bitter sigh escapes him unawares.
There is hardly an evil like that in a woman;
may she fall to the lot of the sinner!
Like a sandy hill to aged feet
is a garrulous wife to a quiet husband.
Do not be enticed by a woman‚Äôs beauty,
or be greedy for her wealth. Sirach 25: 16-21

The scripture says wife but it‚Äôs also true for husbands, if your life partner is wicked ‚Äì it would be better to live with a wild animal. If there is no love in a marriage, when there is nothing left to talk about then life can become a living hell. When one spouse is overly quarrelsome and nagging even everyday life can become a drag. When a spouse does not make any effort to change or do better ‚Äì one can feel trapped in this beautiful sacrament. That is why we should be very careful while picking a spouse don‚Äôt look for beauty or wealth. Look for someone who is good and true, simple and God-loving.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 291 A good wife is a generous gift.

Joke alert: God told all bachelors ‚ÄúThere are many good potential wives in every corner of the earth and then God made the world round‚Äù hahahahaha. Hope this poor joke made you smile.
Imagine someone browsing matrimonial and dating sites that have tons of profiles, one can get frustrated trying to find a good match, it may seem as though there are no more good people left in the world. Although I cannot find you a partner, I would recommend praying that God will bring the right person into your life. The partner you pick will influence your future, your spiritual life, the care of your parents and most importantly the upbringing of children. Try to find a holy, modest, loving and caring person and then you will have a good life.
Happy the husband of a good wife;
the number of his days will be doubled.
A loyal wife brings joy to her husband,
and he will finish his years in peace.
A good wife is a generous gift
bestowed upon him who fears the Lord.
Whether rich or poor, his heart is content,
a smile ever on his face. Sirach 26:1-4
A good spouse is one who will be with you in good and bad times, in rich and poor, in health and sickness, till death do us part. Knowing how to live in moderation and according to one's means is one of the most important qualities that both spouses should have, this will help build a secure and loving environment for the children.
A drunken wife arouses great anger,
for she does not hide her shame.
By her haughty stare and her eyelids
an unchaste wife can be recognized.
Keep a strict watch over an unruly wife,
lest, finding an opportunity, she use it;
Watch out for her impudent eye,
and do not be surprised if she betrays you: Sirach 26:8-11
If a husband or wife is a drunkard then this can cause a lot of strife and unhealthy situation. Sometimes people are overly concerned for looks, fashion and lifestyle this can cause one to make a mistake while choosing a spouse.
A gracious wife delights her husband;
her thoughtfulness puts flesh on his bones.
A silent wife is a gift from the Lord;
nothing is worth more than her self-discipline.
A modest wife is a supreme blessing;
no scales can weigh the worth of her chastity.
We should always look for someone who is self-disciplined and modest. Someone who have virtue and is grounded in their faith. A good tree will bear good fruit and a bad tree bad fruit, we should be very careful and discerning to marry a person who is good. It is very hard for anyone to change their ways, so expecting someone to change after marriage is a far shot.
Let us remember that God has a plan for each of us as we will be given a spouse who will bring the best out of us. Let us pray for our spouses every day and support them in every way possible.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Power of Words

[![The Power of Words](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day292.jpg)](https://youtu.be/r-ozqr4wXMM "The Power of Words")

##### Day 292 Diffuse a quarrel with a good word

Let us try to take a moment to recall the last few times we got angry, and remember what we said when we were angry. More often than not, we would have said something that hurt the other person. When we are angry we say things that we ordinarily would not say.

When there is a quarrel then we can take one of these approaches, flight back, be silent, apologize or diffuse the flight with good words. In the heat of the moment, we are usually unable to say the right words with the right tone. We usually end up saying nasty things to each other and hurting each other. After things cool down, we realize how poorly we spoke and cannot take the words back. These words have broken many relationships and their damage can be felt a lifetime.

A blow from a whip raises a welt,
but a blow from the tongue will break bones.
Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,
but not as many as by the tongue. Sirach 28:17-18

We should train ourselves to be calm and speak well during an argument. Both good and bad words come out of the same mouth.

If you blow into a flame it burns more but if you split into it, it dies down.
If you blow on a spark, it turns into flame,
if you spit on it, it dies out;
yet both you do with your mouth! Sirach 28:12

We should learn how to choose our words wisely, and balance out every word we say. We should put a door and a bolt on our mouth, if we cannot say anything good say nothing.

As you fence in your property with thorns,
so make a door and a bolt for your mouth.
As you lock up your silver and gold,
so make balances and scales for your words.
Take care not to slip by your tongue
and fall victim to one lying in ambush. Sirach 28: 24-26

##### Day 293 We all need discipline

There is no rocket science to this anyone who wants to succeed in life needs to have discipline. Without discipline and dedication, it's almost impossible to be good at anything. We need to start them young and in today‚Äôs reading from Sirach we read a father's instructions to his son, probably showing him the ropes so that his grandchildren will be raised right.

Whoever loves a son will chastise him often,
that he may be his joy when he grows up.
Whoever disciplines a son will benefit from him,
and boast of him among acquaintances.
Whoever educates a son will make his enemy jealous,
and rejoice in him among his friends.
At the father‚Äôs death, he will seem not dead,
for he leaves after him one like himself,
Whom he looked upon through life with joy,
and in death, without regret.

My mom always said ‚ÄúIf you bring a soul into this world you are responsible for it‚Äù. Parents need to discipline their kids and educate them and make them a better version of what the parents are. If we raise our children right we can be joyful on our death bed knowing that this world is a little better because of our good parenting.

Do not withhold discipline from youths;
if you beat them with the rod, they will not die.
Beat them with the rod.
and you will save them from Sheol. Proverbs 23:13-14

This reading may seem harsh, as we don‚Äôt usually see youth being disciplined by the rod in our modern-day and age. The Bible verse does not promote beating children but focuses on disciplining them. Whatever you feel appropriate for your kids like time-outs, grounding, positive parenting, whatever method you take, you need to ensure they have boundaries and limitations, are responsible and accountable.
But discipline should not stop with our children, we should discipline ourselves as well. We should take good care of our bodies as well as our souls.

Better the poor in vigorous health
than the rich with bodily ills.
would rather have bodily health than any gold,
and contentment of spirit than pearls.
No riches are greater than a healthy body;
and no happiness than a joyful heart.
Better is death than a wretched life,
everlasting sleep than constant illness.
Good things set before one who cannot eat
are like food offerings placed before a tomb. Sirach 30:14-18

What good it is if we neglect our health and earn a lot of money, health is better than wealth. Hence the saving ‚ÄúHealth is wealth‚Äù. If we earn all the money in the world and cannot eat anything delicious, what good is all your earnings.
Do not give in to sadness,
or torment yourself deliberately.
Gladness of heart is the very life of a person,
and cheerfulness prolongs his days.
Distract yourself and renew your courage,
drive resentment far away from you;
For grief has killed many,
and nothing is to be gained from resentment.
Envy and anger shorten one‚Äôs days,
and anxiety brings on premature old age. Sirach 30:21-24

We also should take care of our mental health, grief has killed many people either through suicide or causing bad physical health. Envy and anger shorten one‚Äôs life. Let us not give into sadness or resentment ‚Äì instead let us be cheerful and grateful. Anger and Envy can cause us to rot and become grumpy and nasty.
Wakefulness over wealth wastes away the flesh,
and anxiety over it drives away sleep.
Wakeful anxiety banishes slumber;
more than a serious illness it disturbs repose. Sirach 31:2

Anxiety and wakefulness can lead to major health conditions and sicknesses. So let us disciple ourselves to trust in the Lord and to rely fully on Him. To keep our head up and to always be hopeful no matter how bad the situation may look.
Let us try to live a healthy lifestyle with God in the center of it.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 294 Etiquette shows the Character of a Christian

When we call ourselves Christians, we should also live like Christ. Although bad etiquette is not necessarily a mortal sin, a person with good etiquette will be able to be a better example of Christ.
We are all called to put on Christ and bear witness to his holiness.
There is some good advice on etiquette when you're invited to a party. in Sirach 32

1. DON‚ÄôT BE PUFFED UP WITH PRIDE.

If you are chosen to preside at a dinner, do not be puffed up, but with the guests be as one of them; Sirach 23:1

When people go to a party they usually want to wear the best clothes and drive their costliest car. We see people competing with each other for the best jeweler, clothes and accessories. We can hear people chatting about all their achievements and accomplishments all with a purpose to puff up their pride. Let us talk about Christ and his mercy instead. We are but a wildflower there today and gone tomorrow.

2. SPEAK AT THE RIGHT TIME.

You who are older, it is your right to speak, but temper your knowledge and do not interrupt the singing. Where there is entertainment, do not pour out discourse, and do not display your wisdom at the wrong time. Sirach 32:3-4

We see people speaking out of turn or cutting off the other person to make their voice heard. As a person who speaks Christ‚Äôs words, we cannot be harsh with our tongues. Let our words be well chosen and apt for the moment.

3. SPEAK WISELY AND WHEN NECESSARY.
   Speak, young man, only when necessary, when they have asked you more than once.Be brief, say much in few words; be knowledgeable and yet quiet. Sirach 32:7-8

We should only speak once and have an opinion about things and not argue and debate about what others say. Even though we know more than the other it is sometimes better to be quiet and speak only when people are listening. We also should not be too soft-spoken but speak in the right moderation and with wisdom.

4. HAVE A LIMIT ON YOUR TIME

Leave in good time and do not be the last; go home quickly without delay. Sirach 23:11

Some people want to get drunk and party all night long. We should have a check on time when we are invited to other people's homes and leave early. It‚Äôs just common sense, the host may be tired or have kids that need to sleep.
Let us be the best version we can be and emit the light of Christ wherever we go.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.  üôè

##### Day 295 God does not accept bribes

We may bribe our way through society or find loopholes to evade the law. But there is no way to bribe our way to heaven or to get what we want on earth. Many people try to bribe God with their gifts of money, time, or sacrifice. Some folks make deals with God saying if you grant me this favor ‚Äì maybe a job or house or something then I will give certain offerings or feed the poor or something along those lines. We should not try to bribe God with our offers expecting a certain result in return.

Give to the Most High as he has given to you,
generously, according to your means.
For he is a God who always repays
and will give back to you sevenfold.
But offer no bribes; these he does not accept! Sirach 35:12-14

When we give to God we should not have an agenda behind it, we should just trust God with every area of our lives. God‚Äôs plans for us are better than our own and He is a faithful God. We should freely and joyfully give to God. For God loves a cheerful giver.

Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:7

We know that God is a faithful God who will never go back on His promise. He will give us back 7 folds of our gift. We should give according to our means because we received everything from God in the first place. The only time God asks us to test Him is for the return of the tithe.

Bring the whole tithe
into the storehouse,
That there may be food in my house.
Put me to the test, says the LORD of hosts,
And see if I do not open the floodgates of heaven for you,
and pour down upon you blessing without measure! Malachi 3:10

God is calling us to give our whole tithe and to trust Him for a blessing, a blessing that will be far more than we can imagine. The floodgates of heaven will be opened a large blessing will pour down.

Do not appear before the Lord empty-handed,
for all that you offer is in fulfillment of the precepts.
The offering of the just enriches the altar:
a sweet odor before the Most High.
The sacrifice of the just is accepted, never to be forgotten. Sir 35:6-9

So the next time we approach the temple of the Lord, let us not go empty-handed but let us give freely according to our means, without bribing the Lord or expecting a certain result. Let us expect the Lord to bless us beyond our imagination.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 296 Gluttony.

My son, while you are well, govern your appetite,
and see that you do not allow it what is bad for you.
For not everything is good for everyone,
nor is everything suited to every taste.
Do not go to excess with any enjoyment,
neither become a glutton for choice foods;
For sickness comes with overeating,
and gluttony brings on nausea.
Through lack of self-control many have died,
but the abstemious one prolongs life.

Some very good advice here on healthy eating. Some people eat to live and some live to eat, we should try our best to have a moderate appetite. When we are well, we should control our intake, eat healthy and nutritious food. If we do not follow a healthy eating habbit we will get sick some sooner and some later. Once people get chronic conditions that is when they realize that eating too much of sugar, salt, fat or fried foods is not good for the body. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we have to take good care of it.

Gluttony can creep into us unknowingly and we can become victims of poor food choices. Once we get some chronic condition then it becomes mandatory to eat a die least we become worse.
Gluttony is a very common sin and is even well-accepted in society.

Below excerpt taken from [cathstan.org](https://cathstan.org)

Gluttony is eating or drinking inordinately, contrary to reason. It is a sin opposed to the virtue of temperance because it is the immoderate indulgence in the delights of food or drink. Gluttony can involve more than merely eating too much. Drunkenness is also a type of gluttony because it is excessive indulgence in intoxicating drink.

A person can be excessive in what, when, how, and how much he eats. St. Thomas Aquinas and others have distinguished five ways gluttony can be manifested. One can approach food or drink:
Hastily, by eating too rapidly, gulping down food or drink. As a gift of God, food and drink should be savored and enjoyed. To fail in this regard is not only impolite when in the company of others but can also be offensive to God or to those who have prepared the meal. By hastily eating or drinking, one downplays the gift by rushing past its subtleties and delights, which require a more moderate rate of consumption to appreciate fully. Rapid consumption also tends to lead to overconsumption, whether food or drink.
Sumptuously, by demanding rich foods more so than healthier fare. For example, consuming sweets and fatty foods rather than fruits and vegetables, or expensive foods rather than more moderate ones, fine wines and liquors rather than water and juice.

Excessively, by habitually consuming too much.
Greedily, by demanding what one wants, when one wants it, and in the quantity one wants. Some are unwilling to share food or drink with others; others demand to be served first; still others insist on being served separately.
Daintily, by insisting that food be prepared to exacting standards of appearance or taste.
Yes, gluttony can be manifested in many ways, not just through excessive consumption.

St Thomas also noted these five ‚Äúdaughters‚Äù of gluttony:

Unseemly joy ‚Äì This is best seen as a result of excessive consumption of intoxicating drink but eating too much can also lead to a levity that is beyond what is reasonable. There is an expression that is dismissive of a necessary seriousness: ‚ÄúEat, drink, and be merry.‚Äù There is also the foolish saying, ‚ÄúLife is short; eat dessert first.‚Äù

Scurrility (foolish talking) ‚Äì Long meals are often rife with gossip and silly or imprudent speech. Add alcohol and conversation can become increasingly unruly and flippant.
Uncleanness ‚Äì Some are so addicted to the feast and the table that they induce vomiting to ‚Äúmake room‚Äù so that that they can return and consume more. Others vomit from the overconsumption itself, sometimes after having passed out.

Loquaciousness ‚Äì This is similar to scurrility but refers to talking too much in general rather than the content of the speech.

Dullness of mind ‚Äì Heavy food or intoxicating drink can cause sluggishness and sleepiness. Drinking too much can lower a person‚Äôs inhibitions. One seldom does good thinking after a heavy meal or a bout of excessive drinking.
While gluttony is not the most serious of sins (sins of the spirit are more consequential), gluttony can be one of the more disgraceful because of its effect on the intellect.
Gluttony can become very serious in at least four ways:
First, drunkenness is a species of gluttony. The quantity of human tears shed on account of its effects demonstrate the havoc wrought.
Second, gluttony is an addiction and addictions are a serious problem.
Third, there can be a deep folly involved in gluttony by thinking that one can satisfy inner emptiness with things of this world.
Finally, gluttony is closely connected to avarice and lust.

##### Using Good Things for Evil

##### Day 297 Physicians and Medicine are a blessing from God.

When it comes to doctors and medicine we find people on both sides of the spectrum, some trust only in God and don‚Äôt care for medical treatment, and some only trust in the doctors and medicine without relying on God. When it comes to medical care there are no two ways about it, medical care is from God. The doctor is an instrument of God and healing is only from God, the doctor gives medicine but healing is brought about only by God. There should not be any conflict because it is God who ultimately heals us.

For those who say they don‚Äôt need a doctor they need to read this instruction. I know a few famous preachers who say doctors are not for Christian, Christians should always pray for a miracle.

1. Make friends with the doctor, for he is essential to you; God has also established him in his profession.
2. From God the doctor has wisdom,
   and from the king he receives sustenance.
3. Knowledge makes the doctor distinguished,
   and gives access to those in authority.
4. God makes the earth yield healing herbs
   which the prudent should not neglect;
5. Was not the water sweetened by a twig,
   so that all might learn his power?
6. He endows people with knowledge,
   to glory in his mighty works,
7. Through which the doctor eases pain,
8. and the druggist prepares his medicines.
   Thus God‚Äôs work continues without cease
   in its efficacy on the surface of the earth.
9. My son, when you are ill, do not delay,
   but pray to God, for it is he who heals.

We also have to be careful about thinking that it is the doctor and the medicine that heals and God has nothing to do with it. We need to remember that God is the creator of everything and all wisdom comes from God. So the doctor who eases pain and the druggist who prepares the medicine are all God‚Äôs creations themselves. Also, the herbs and materials used in medicine are a creation of God. No matter how advanced science and technology gets healing is attributed to God alone.

The doctor can treat by only God can heal. We should first pray to God to heal us and for the Lord to guide the minds and hearts of the doctors we visit.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 298 Do not fear death

It seems that everyone is trying their best to live longer, look younger, and secure thier life on earth. Now there is nothing wrong with this as long as we are also preparing for our next life by doing good deeds and living a holy life.
If we are only concerned about this life then we will fear death

O death! How bitter is the thought of you
for the one at peace in his home,
For the one who is serene and always successful,
who can still enjoy life‚Äôs pleasures. Sirach 41:1

Death may be something some people may be hoping for, especially those who are suffering. Sometimes people we are caring for the terminally sick may even pray that God may take them.

O death! How welcome is your sentence
to the weak, failing in strength,
Stumbling and tripping on everything,
with sight gone and hope lost.a Sirach 41:2

Whatever be the case, we should always be ready for death if we are preparing for it we will not fear.

Do not fear death‚Äôs decree for you;
remember, it embraces those before you and those to come. Sirach 41:3

As in the wedding feast parable, we are expected to wear wedding garments and be ready for the day the Lord calls us.
The clothes are our 1. good deeds 2. Good nature 3. Christ

1. GOOD DEEDS ARE THE CLOTHES THAT THE BRIDE IN REVELATIONS IS WHAT MAKE THE FINE LINEN.
   Rev 19: 7-8
   Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory,
   for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
   and his Bride has made herself ready;
   8 it was granted her to be clothed
   with fine linen, bright and pure‚Äù‚Äî
   for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
2. GOOD NATURE

Col 3:12-15
As God‚Äôs chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.

3. WE ARE TO PUT ON CHRIST

Ep 4: 22-24 You were taught to put away your former way of life, your old self, corrupt and deluded by its lusts, 23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 24 and to clothe yourselves with the new self, created according to the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh Rom 13:14

What we lack in our own ability, God makes up for us in the life , death and resurrection of Christ. Let us face death with confidence that Jesus died for us and If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.(Rom 8:11)

##### Jeremiah Hides the Ark

[![Jeremiah Hides the Ark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day299.jpg)](https://youtu.be/p8z56ESPQ5s "Jeremiah Hides the Ark")

##### Day 299 The hiding and finding of the Ark of the Covenant

In the 2nd book Maccabees which was written around 100 BC, says that the prophet Jeremiah, "being warned by God" before the Babylonian invasion, took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave, informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown "until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy."

The Ark of the Covenant was most important to the Jews as this was where the presence of God could be experienced, it was always placed in the Holy of Holies and only one priest would be assigned to go in and would even faint sometimes because the presence of God was too powerful. The Ark of the Covenant had the 10 commandments, Manna the bread from heaven and Arron‚Äôs staff that blossomed ‚Äì the sign of priesthood. Jeremiah had this all hidden within the cave and it was unmarked. This is that last we will see of the Ark of the Covenant ‚Äì it will never be found until John sees it in the book of Revelations.

Then God‚Äôs temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1

The New Testament has a new Ark of the Covenant which is a person ‚Äì Mother Mary. The new Ark contained the fulfillment of all of what the old Ark contained. The old Ark had 10 commandments the old law/word and the new Ark has Jesus the Word made flesh. The Old Ark had Manna ‚Äì The bread from that fell from Heaven and the new Ark has Jesus the living and true bread that came down from heaven. The Old Ark had Arron‚Äôs staff that blossomed ‚Äì the sign of priesthood and the New Ark had Jesus ‚Äì the great high priest.
We Christians have found the Ark of the Covenant our dear Mother Mary.

##### Day 300 The sovereign power of God

Some people cannot handle defeat they want to win at any cost, they are ruthless and cruel or outright barbarous one such example is Simon in Maccabees. The high priest Onias was a very devout and pious, one who hated evil, because of his devotion everything was going very well in the temple.
Simon who was the appointment superintendent of the temple had a quarrel with Onias and lost. In order to see his downfall Simon went to the pagan king and reported that the temple was full of untold riches. The King sends his officers to forcefully bring the money to the royal treasury.
This money was actually for the widows and orphans who had no other means of survival. Now the priests and all the people had no other option but to ask God for his protection.
Priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priestly robes and called toward heaven for the one who had given the law about deposits to keep the deposits safe for those who had made them.

Whoever saw the appearance of the high priest was pierced to the heart, for the changed complexion of his face revealed his mental anguish.
The terror and bodily trembling that had come over the man clearly showed those who saw him the pain that lodged in his heart.
People rushed out of their houses and crowded together making common supplication, because the place was in danger of being profaned. Maccabees 3: 15-18

God Protects the Temple.

24But just as Heliodorus was arriving at the treasury with his bodyguards, the Lord of spirits and all authority produced an apparition so great that those who had been bold enough to accompany Heliodorus were panic-stricken at God‚Äôs power and fainted away in terror.
25There appeared to them a richly caparisoned horse, mounted by a fearsome rider. Charging furiously, the horse attacked Heliodorus with its front hooves. The rider was seen wearing golden armor.
26Then two other young men, remarkably strong, strikingly handsome, and splendidly attired, appeared before him. Standing on each side of him, they flogged him unceasingly, inflicting innumerable blows.
27Suddenly he fell to the ground, enveloped in great darkness. His men picked him up and laid him on a stretcher.
28They carried away helpless the man who a moment before had entered that treasury under arms with a great retinue and his whole bodyguard. They clearly recognized the sovereign power of God.
Maccabees 3: 24-28

When there seems to be no other option God comes through for us, He is always there and just by a word God can move mountains for us. There are always countless angles around us, just waiting for deployment orders. Even though we don‚Äôt see them we can be sure that they will come to our aid in time of need.

For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent. Ps 91: 11-13

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. Ps 34: 7

##### Day 301 Sports More Important than Church

Yesterday we read how corrupt Simon was trying to get rid Onias the devout high priest. As we read more there are other people trying to become high priests not because they want to lead God‚Äôs people spiritually but for monetary/social gain.
Onias‚Äô brother Jason is also trying to obtain the high priesthood by corrupt means, by bribing the king. Apart from bribing the king he also promised to establish a gymnasium and youth center which would initiate the youth into the Greek way of life.
Besides this he would undertake to pay a hundred and fifty more, if he was given authority to establish a gymnasium and a youth center for it and to enroll Jerusalemites as citizens of Antioch.

When Jason received the king‚Äôs approval and came into office, he immediately initiated his compatriots into the Greek way of life. 2 Maccabees 4:9-10

The King approved of Jason‚Äôs plans and this there was a decline in Jewish practices and customs by the youth and a attachment to the new Greek way of life.
With perverse delight he established a gymnasium at the very foot of the citadel, where he induced the noblest young men to wear the Greek hat.
The craze for Hellenism and the adoption of foreign customs reached such a pitch, through the outrageous wickedness of Jason, the renegade and would-be high priest,
that the priests no longer cared about the service of the altar. Disdaining the temple and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened, at the signal for the games, to take part in the unlawful exercises at the arena.
What their ancestors had regarded as honors they despised; what the Greeks esteemed as glory they prized highly. 2 Maccabees 4:13-15

Jason knew and so did the king, if they could get the youth to follow the Greek lifestyle then the next generation would not be a treat to the kingdom, they would abandon their faith, customs and practices.
This is exactly what is happening in our generation, little Tom or Sally has Baseball/Soccer/Football/Dance class on the weekend and the whole family can‚Äôt go to church. The game is On and we need to get the house ready for our friends and family so we are not going to church. When we elevate sports and arts above God and church we are heading for a disaster. Just like the Jews forgot their faith and got carried away by the Greek Gymnasium and games so is our generation going away from Church and God.
This has to stop!!!! If not we lose the youth the future of the church.
We need to ensure that going to church on Sunday/Saturday eve is the most important thing to our family. If it comes to it, we should be willing to skip games/practice for Church. We need more Christians to talk to coaches and clubs to schedule practice at a convenient time such that every child gets to go to Church. If we don‚Äôt act non, we have lost a generation.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 301 By Cynthia Dsilva

Proverbs 24:16
*The righteous man falls seven times, but rises up again.*

If a righteous man can fall even after rising up again, then, due to the weakness of our souls we too are likely to fall into sin over and over again.

The devil is very tricky and he always uses new tricks to lure us into his kingdom. Every time we are deceived in a new way it takes us a while before we understand that deception and then try to avoid it.

The only difference between sinners and saints on earth is that saints keep getting up through regular repentance.

##### DAY 301 By Sheila

SIRACH 48:1-4, 9-11
In speaking of Elijah, Jesus is predicting His own death. At the same time, He is preparing His Disciples to face what awaits them. Jesus tells them, "The Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands." However, the disciples assume that Jesus is talking about John the Baptist. As usual, they did not understand what Jesus meant.
At times, we also do not understand what Jesus is saying to us and it's implications to our lives. Jesus foresees His Passion and Death with equanimity. This can help us to accept and understand the sufferings in our own lives. The Spirit of Elijah inspires us to see, that our sufferings are a way of sharing the destiny of Jesus and to face them serenely.

[![The Pursuit of Wisdom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day302.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b8Em54ORKIE "The Pursuit of Wisdom")

##### Day 302 Don‚Äôt rejoice when your enemies fall.

This world is filled with many people who are let‚Äôs `not that good`, trying to use the least offensive word here. In our daily lives, we rub up against such people and we can get angry. Anger itself is not a sin as long as we channel it correctly. If we allow anger to rule our actions then we can possibly sin.

When someone repeatedly sins against us or does something terribly wrong we react and hurt them back. But most good Christians are able to let go and avoid such people.
One thing that we may need to work on is totally letting go of the offenses. We sort of harbor hatred towards our enemies and when something bad happens to them we take some sort of joy. We are like ‚ÄúThis stupid person I know God will show them‚Äù. This proverb instructs us to not take pleasure in the downfall of our enemies.

Do not rejoice when your enemies fall,
and when they stumble, do not let your heart exult,
Lest the LORD see it, be displeased with you,
and withdraw his wrath from your enemies. Sirach 24:17-18

The tendency to rejoice over the bad fortune of our enemies is leading to the deadly sin of wrath.

Wrath, in Roman Catholic theology, one of the seven deadly sins. Wrath is defined as a strong feeling of hatred or resentment with a desire for vengeance. This overwhelming feeling and desire for revenge distinguishes wrath from anger that is balanced with reason, which is not a sin.
Although we may never take extreme steps of wrath, we may resort to other passive forms, like silent treatment, not cooperating with the person, gossiping about the person, long harboring anger when we think of the person.
The next time we feel like rejoicing over the downfall of our enemies let us stop in our tracks and remember that this may be an intro sin to full-blown wrath.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 303 Be a good example to the world.

We read about the Martyrdom of Eleazar who was a devout Jew an old man who has been practicing his faith all his life.

18 Eleazar, one of the foremost scribes, a man advanced in age and of noble appearance, was being forced to open his mouth to eat pork.
19But preferring a glorious death to a life of defilement, he went forward of his own accord to the instrument of torture,
20spitting out the meat as they should do who have the courage to reject food unlawful to taste even for love of life.
21Those in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man aside, because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged him to bring his own provisions that he could legitimately eat, and only to pretend to eat the sacrificial meat prescribed by the king.
Even if, for the time being, I avoid human punishment, I shall never, whether alive or dead, escape the hand of the Almighty.
27Therefore, by bravely giving up life now, I will prove myself worthy of my old age,
28and I will leave to the young a noble example of how to die willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws.‚Äù

He spoke thus, and went immediately to the instrument of torture.
Those who shortly before had been kindly disposed, now became hostile toward him because what he had said seemed to them utter madness.

30When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned, saying: ‚ÄúThe Lord in his holy knowledge knows full well that, although I could have escaped death, I am not only enduring terrible pain in my body from this scourging, but also suffering it with joy in my soul because of my devotion to him.‚Äù
31This is how he died, leaving in his death a model of nobility and an unforgettable example of virtue not only for the young but for the whole nation.

The lesson to learn from this sacrificial life of Eleazar is that we should not be afraid to live our faith out in public. What others think or say should not bother us, we should just trust the Lord and lead by example.
We usually tend to hide our faith in public, however we are called by Jesus to witness to him in public.

Everyone who acknowledges me before others I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father.
But whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my heavenly Father. Mat 10:32-33

Remember for the first generation followers of Jesus that meant risking their life. If they crucified Jesus they would also kill anyone who acknowledged him in public.
Even though we may not face death, we can sure face rejection from the world if we acknowledge Christ. Let us pray for strength whenever we are faced with an opportunity to witness.
The people who were pretending to support Eleazer told him that they would give him some other meet instead of swine meat, all he needed to do is consume it in public and then he can do whatever he pleased after that. But Eleazer was not a hypocrite, he was true to his word.
He even offered up his life for the Lord, even though he was very old he was able to bear the torture and death without caving into temptation. Let us pray that we will be filled with similar faith when we are tested.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 303 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 1:12-15
*Do not invite death by the errors of your life, nor bring on destruction by the works of your hands, because God did not make death, nor does he rejoice in the destruction of the living. For he fashioned all things that they might exist, and the creatures of the world are wholesome; There is no destructive poison in them and the dominion of Hades is not on earth, for righteousness is immortal.*

It is our human nature to desire a long life because that is what God has implanted in us. Man was created holy and full of grace to live forever with God in that state. But because of our fallen nature we desire a long life on earth, without God.
Death came in due to the devil's envy because man and woman were created in the image and likeness of God.

Wisdom 2:12‚Äì22
This is how the wicked people plot against a righteous man who regards himself as God‚Äôs son. They condemn him to a shameful death, but they do not recognize the secret purposes of God, who created man for incorruption.
This is a clearer Messianic prophecy than most.

Wisdom 2:23-24
*God created us to be incorruptible, and made us in the image of his own eternal likeness, but through the devil‚Äôs envy death entered the world, and those who belong to the devil‚Äôs company experience it.*

Jealousy and envy are related but they are clearly distinct.

Jealousy can be good though it rarely is.
Envy is always evil. It is also one of the 7 deadly sins.

Jealousy causes us to desire what others have, whether it is material possessions, or status, or fame, etc. Jealousy can also cause us to increase our efforts to be equal or better than others. Jealousy must not progress to envy.
Envy causes us to desire the destruction of others. We rejoice in their sufferings and mourn when they prosper.

God calls Himself a jealous God (Exodus 20:5) because when we follow the wrong path, He wants our souls back from Satan so that we don‚Äôt suffer eternal destruction, just as any parent would want their child back from a kidnapper to save the child from possible physical torture and destruction.

He wants us to offer our gifts to Him, from whom we receive them, so that He can bless us.
He wants us to worship and obey Him, who created us in His image, so that we can live in a state of grace and share in His eternal glory.

Envy was, and is, Lucifer's motive that causes him to entice humans to follow his path and thus share in his eternal destruction.

##### Life Beyond Death

[![Life Beyond Death](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day304.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QtSYb7-m3xw "Life Beyond Death")

##### Day 304 A strong family ready to give it all up for the Lord.

Like Eleazer, there were many others who were ready to lay down their life for the law. We read about this mother with 7 sons who did not fear the torture nor did they give into the bribes of the King, they laid it all down for the Lord. They choose to sacrifice their earthly lives in order to gain entry into the heavenly life where there is no suffering or pain.

2 Maccabees 7: 1-6

It also happened that seven brothers with their mother were arrested and tortured with whips and scourges by the king to force them to eat pork in violation of God‚Äôs law.
One of the brothers, speaking for the others, said: ‚ÄúWhat do you expect to learn by questioning us? We are ready to die rather than transgress the laws of our ancestors.‚Äù
At that the king, in a fury, gave orders to have pans and caldrons heated.
These were quickly heated, and he gave the order to cut out the tongue of the one who had spoken for the others, to scalp him and cut off his hands and feet, while the rest of his brothers and his mother looked on.
When he was completely maimed but still breathing, the king ordered them to carry him to the fire and fry him. As a cloud of smoke spread from the pan, the brothers and their mother encouraged one another to die nobly, with these words:
‚ÄúThe Lord God is looking on and truly has compassion on us, as Moses declared in his song, when he openly bore witness, saying, ‚ÄòAnd God will have compassion on his servants.‚Äô‚Äù
They tortured and killed the 6 brothers, imagine how difficult it must have been for the mother to witness this cruelty against the children she bore.
Finally they tried to tempt the youngest son with riches and a good position in the kingdom.
2 Maccabees 24 -

As the youngest brother was still alive, the king appealed to him, not with mere words, but with promises on oath, to make him rich and happy if he would abandon his ancestral customs: he would make him his Friend and entrust him with high office.

The King even made his mother convince him, but the mother in turn asked him to not give in to the temptations. He did not succumb to the temptation but stood up for the law.
2 Maccabees 7: 27, 39, 40 and 41

Like my brothers, I offer up my body and my life for our ancestral laws, imploring God to show mercy soon to our nation, and by afflictions and blows to make you confess that he alone is God.
At that, the king became enraged and treated him even worse than the others, since he bitterly resented the boy‚Äôs contempt.
Thus he too died undefiled, putting all his trust in the Lord.
Last of all, after her sons, the mother was put to death.

This is such a strong witness that the mother and her 7 sons.
It‚Äôs easy to read about these stories and comment on them.

But imagine you and your family were at Sunday Mass and a person came in and threatened to kill all Christians. Those who considered themselves non-Christians could leave the church unharmed.

Would you and your family stay or leave?

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 304 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 3:1-6
*But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be a disaster, and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace.*

When a righteous person dies, according to the physical reality the world sees them as dead, but according to the spiritual reality their souls are safe in the hands of God. Satan can only succeed in destroying the bodies of the righteous ones but not their souls (Matthew 10:28).

*For though in the sight of others they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. Having been disciplined a little, they shall be greatly blessed, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself; like gold in the furnace he tried them, and like a sacrificial burnt offering he accepted them.*

When we go through trials and tribulations during our lifetime God is definitely aware of everything and He allows it to either test us or to purify us, and lead us on His path, if we are living our lives according to God's Will. Our sufferings on earth help to reduce our time in Purgatory. We must therefore accept whatever suffering God allows in our lives and offer our sufferings to Christ as penance for sins.

But if we are living sinful lives (mortal sins) then our trials and tribulations will be the result of our sins. In such case it is important that we examine our conscience and ensure that our souls are purified without delay by receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation regularly.

##### DAY 304 By Sheila

2 Maccabees 7:1-2, 9-14.
We hear the gruesome story of the brutal killing of Seven brothers and their Mother, forced to watch them suffer and die. But they all encourage each other to remain faithful and cling to the hope of Resurrection and Vindication for their integrity. How insignificant are some of our moments of choosing to be faithful to God's Word in comparison! And yet we have been given the Spirit of God for consolation and also to strengthen us so that we might do justice, preach the Gospel deeds and help others to progress in their obedience to the Gospel.
The ground line of our lives is that God rules our hearts (where our will is) and that we live loving all others as God has loved us.
We stake our lives on the Resurrection. We believe God The Father has raised Jesus from the dead in the Power of the Spirit and that we too will be raised by the Father in the Power of the Spirit. In fact, we live that Resurrection Life now in Christ through our Baptisms. We do not know what that life will be like but we believe that it will be the fullness of life, as the Children of God with Jesus. We live now our lives given over in Sacrifice(made Holy) to Our God who is The God of the Living. We must keep this in mind now, so that when we die, we can reach for this hope with Confidence.

##### Day 305 The desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom.

If you are able to keep up with the `Bible in a year` program for so long, I‚Äôm sure your heart is set on wisdom. I‚Äôm sure you seek to know God more and understand His word. Our desire is to know God and love Him.

For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline. Wisdom 6:17

Even if we feel we don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt understand the Bible much, we can be certain that we are on the right track and that our discipline to earnestly desire wisdom is all that God needs.

Desire therefore my words;
long for them and you will be instructed.
Resplendent and unfading is Wisdom,
and she is readily perceived by those who love her,
and found by those who seek her.
13She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her;
14one who watches for her at dawn will not be disappointed,
for she will be found sitting at the gate.

Those of us who desire to know God‚Äôs word and are eager to understand God‚Äôs plan for our lives and His will in all matters will not be disappointed. Wisdom will be found sitting at our gate. We will receive insight like never before. We will be surprised how the Holy Spirit will remind us about scripture and refresh our souls whenever we feel down cast.

For the first step toward Wisdom is an earnest desire for discipline; then, care for discipline is love of her;love means the keeping of her laws;To observe her laws is the basis for incorruptibility; and incorruptibility makes one close to God; thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom 6:7-20

We have a beautiful progression of our spiritual life mentioned here in the Book of Wisdom. What starts with an ernest desire for wisdom eventually leads us to the Kingdom.
The steps to the Kingdom as described in the book are listed below.

1. Earnest desire for discipline
2. Which leads to Love of wisdom
3. The love of wisdom means Keeping the laws
4. Keeping the law means incorruptibility
5. and incorruptibility makes one close to God
6. thus the desire for Wisdom leads to a kingdom.

Those of us who are seeking God in this program are in fact getting closer to the Kingdom. Even if we are something unfaithful, our God is always Faithful and will lead us to the Kingdom.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Wisdom is Beautiful

[![Wisdom is Beautiful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day306.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Bx7Kp2AnF_M "Wisdom is Beautiful")

##### Day 306 Wisdom defined

The word wisdom is understood as the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise. Someone could have wisdom about certain topics. However, the wisdom spoken about in the book of wisdom has a very deep meaning

For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,
23unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
24For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.
25 For she is a breath of the might of God. Wisdom 7:22-27

I seems like wisdom seems to be giving us a small sample of the nature of God. For wisdom is defined as holy, all-powerful, all-seeing which are also attributes of God.
So when we read the book of wisdom we should admire the deeper meaning when the author refers to wisdom.
We should take some time to sit down and pray ‚Äì possibly ponder of each of the below attributes of wisdom.

1. Spirit
2. Intelligent
3. Holy
4. Unique
5. Manifold
6. Subtle
7. Agile
8. Clear
9. Unstained
10. Certain
11. Never harmful
12. Loving the good
13. Keen
14. Unhampered
15. Beneficent
16. Kindly
17. Firm
18. Secure
19. Tranquil
20. all-powerful
21. all-seeing
22. pervading all spirits
23. Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion
24. penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity
25. breath of the might of God

As we ponder on these 25 attributes let us remember that we cannot define God or even understand his wisdom.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 1 Cor 1:25

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God‚Äôs horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God‚Äôs power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord‚Äôs people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God‚Äôs horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know ‚Äì God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 308 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind; And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us. Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins. Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.

##### Praying for the Dead

[![Praying for the Dead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day309.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3TAqAFIpp30 "Praying for the Dead")

##### Day 309 Praying for the dead

Judas Maccabeus fought more battles and was victories. In one of the battles some of his men were killed, given that it was the Sabbath they decided to go get the dead after they celebrated the sabbath.

On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs.
40But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.

He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, in as much as he had the resurrection in mind;
44for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
45But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
46Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin. 2 maccabees12: 39-40, 43-46

It may seem strange for them to do a collection of money and they offer a sin offering on behalf of the dead. Given that fact that they found the idols of Jamnia on them. In some for the Jewish men had committed idolatry. Why pray for them, Judas could have just declared that they died because of the just punishment and forgotten about them.

Praying for the dead is nothing new that the Catholics came up with, it‚Äôs a practice observed by the Jews. But why should we pray for the dead if they either go to heaven or hell. The only possible reason would be if there is a place of purification called purgatory where people with some minor sins await entry into heaven. Because God is so pure and holy, we would need to be fully purified to feel worthy of His presence. Hence the need for a place called purgatory.

As we recently celebrated All Souls Day, where we would have prayed for the dead in our family. Let us not forget to offer prayers for the souls in purgatory, especially for those souls that need a lot of prayer. Making sacrifices and Offering indulgences for them can speed up their entry into eternal bliss. Let us also teach our children to pray for the souls in purgatory, so when we die someone will pray for us also. üôÇ

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Rivals for the Heart

##### Day 310 Patient Perseverance

‚ÄúBy patience is a ruler persuaded,
and a soft tongue can break a bone.‚Äù Prov 25:15

Many a thing in life is not achieved because we give up or give in. We start off with great zeal and fire to accomplish the goal, but on the way we either get distracted, discouraged, or impatient. Today‚Äôs proverb helps us to understand that some things in life require persistence and long-lasting effort.

For example when we open up the WhatsApp group for people to join ‚Äúthe Bible in a Year‚Äù program there are so many zealous ones who want to complete it. But we can always see a steady decline in the folks that are committed to completing the program. Although many successfully complete it in a year, most people like me may take 2 years or some 3. It is totally fine if you are not able to keep up due to life‚Äôs demands. God is merciful and gives us our whole life to read the Bible, also it is more important that the word becomes flesh. Head knowledge is good, but we also have to internalize the Bible and live it out, which is not easy. But we always have God‚Äôs mercy and kindness who helps us in our weakness, guides us in our difficulties and sustains us to complete the good deed that we have started.

We need to be calm and assertive trying our best to navigate life and live a Christ-centric life. When we have bad rulers or bad policies then pushing back hard against them may not work. We need to consistently oppose bad policies and rulers until our voice is heard and we need to pray for long-lasting motivation.

We see many examples in the world that we can learn from.

1. Thomas Edison did not give up trying to invent the light bulb after testing thousands of materials that would not make the right filament.

2. Look at Lincoln‚Äôs resume before he was elected president. Despite a past littered with failures; he became one of, if not the greatest Presidents of the United States.

3. Saint Frances Cabrini (‚ÄúMother Cabrini‚Äù). Despite her frail health and her strong desire to go to China, she was advised by the Pope to go west to America and minister to the immigrant population. Mother Cabrini founded sixty-seven institutions, including schools, hospitals, and orphanages, one for each of her sixty-seven years of life on this earth. She was also the first naturalized American Saint. A great example of what one person can do against all odds.

4. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton came from wealth, was married with children, and lived quite a different life from the widowed convert who was to found the Sisters of Charity and become the first American-born saint.

5. Saint Martin de Porres of Lima, Peru was the child of a black mother and a Spanish father. Because of this, he was ridiculed and severely mocked. However, through his great perseverance and humility, he was finally accepted into the Dominican order he so earnestly yearned to join and became a model for those who seek God through poverty, sacrifice, penance, and humility.

Let us be inspired by these examples in our lives and preserve with all our strength and energy to achieve what we have set out to do. Heaven is the biggest goal of our lives and we should persevere till the end to reach our goal. Of course, God will always pick us up every time we fall and carry us into heaven as long as our heart is set on Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### God Fights for You

##### Day 311 Helping a troubled heart.

When we see troubled people, we usually either avoid them or try to cheer them on. Some people even go to the extent of betraying or abandoning someone when they are in trouble. This could be really hard on someone who desperately needs support.

The other approach some take is to try to cheer up the troubled person. Buy them a drink or try to their minds with something or the other. This does not really help the person in trouble. The proverb in today‚Äôs reading teaches us just that.

A bad tooth or an unsteady foot‚Äî
a trust betrayed in time of trouble.
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
is the one who sings to a troubled heart. ‚Äì Proverbs 25:19-20

So what should be the right approach to someone who is in distress?
First thing to be done is to notice a person in trouble, in the parable of the good Smartian the priest and the Levite both did not even notice the person who was robbed and beaten.
But the Samaritan was moved with compassion, he stopped, took care of his wounds and even paid for his stay at an inn.

We should follow the approach of the good Smartian, be attentive to troubled people around us. We should do everything that we can to help out anyone who may be in trouble.
We are called to carry each other‚Äôs burdens.

‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Gal 6:2

We should always make friends and have each other‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their work; If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up.‚Äù Ecc 4:9-10

How pitiful it would be if you had no one who has your back, no one to pick you up when you fall. It usually would be the case if you did not pick someone up when they needed help. In the world we seem to be getting more and more isolated, we call it independence but I think we are missing out on something great.
We are God‚Äôs hands and God‚Äôs feet in this world. God promised that he would be close to the broken hearted. Let us make it our mission to be God‚Äôs hand and feet to the broken hearted person.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Ps 34:18

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 312 Rely fully on God

The great warrior Judas Maccabeus who won many battles where he was outnumbered, did not win by his own strength or the strength of his army. He always relied on the arm of God and the angels that God sent ahead of his battles.
Maccabeus, surveying the hosts before him, the variety of weaponry, and the fierceness of their beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he knew that it is not weapons but the Lord‚Äôs decision that brings victory to those who deserve it.

22Calling upon God, he spoke in this manner: ‚ÄúYou, master, sent your angel in the days of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand men of Sennacherib‚Äôs camp.
23And now, Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to spread fear and trembling ahead of us.
24By the might of your arm may those be struck down who have blasphemously come against your holy people!‚Äù With these words he ended his prayer. 2 Maccabees 15:21-24

Let us learn this and apply it to life, we should try our best but rely fully on God to give us the victory. God will send his workers - ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù to fight for us and make a way for us to progress.
For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; Ps 91:11

God has placed a guardian angel in charge of us, also other angels play in important part in our lives. So let us now forget to invoke their help especially when we are on mission to do something.
Like the Israelite kings and leaders, we should not just put all our trust in our chariots and horses but depend fully on God. We should not just trust our education, financial backing, doctors and medicine, but we should know that all these are but a gift from God and that we rely on God for everything.

Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. Ps 20:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

5. The Crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:18-30)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 313 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 1:24-27
*After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion.*
Why did Elizabeth remain in seclusion when she was the recipient of a miracle and the bearer of such good news?

In the Jewish culture, it was as disgraceful for a woman to be with child in her old age, as it was for a woman to be barren. According to the Jews, a barren woman was a curse for society, and an old woman with child was looked down upon as a woman of ill repute. Elizabeth, therefore, had to remain in seclusion so that the negativity would not have any negative emotional effect on her and on the child during the first five months of her pregnancy.

*She said, ‚Äúthe Lord has blessed me at a time when He has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.‚Äù*
These were the same words spoken by Rachel when the Lord blessed her with a child, because she was childless for many years. (Genesis 30:23).

*Six months later, the angel Gabriel was sent down by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph. The Virgin‚Äôs name was Mary.*
God sent His angel to ask Mary‚Äôs permission to be the mother of His Son.
We therefore honor Mary because God honored her first.

The first Exodus began when an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb and appointed him for the mission (Exodus 3:1-4).

The new Exodus began when Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and appointed her for the mission.

Betrothal involved sharing one cup of wine between the man and woman as a sign of acceptance of each other.
In the modern times the couple exchanges rings.

The fundamental point which is underscored by the virgin birth is that since Jesus doesn‚Äôt have a human father; His father must be looked for outside of the human realm. His Father is not on earth but in Heaven because His Father is God.

Mary pleased God more than any other women did, and God was so pleased with her, that the new Adam took flesh and bone from her, the new Eve, and she became His immediate blood relative, an unparalleled honor.

In preparing herself more and more for the Savior, God transformed Mary, the Ark of the new Covenant, making her His mother, so that from an ordinary human being, she became His perfect resting place.

God continues to look for sincere and humble hearts preparing themselves for Him to rest in.
Like Mary, when we carry Jesus in our hearts like a true family member, through our holy and obedient life, we will enable Him to make the world His resting place and thereby His own family.

Let us join our character to Mary‚Äôs so that we can make a perfect resting place in our hearts for her Son.

Luke 1:31-33
*And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus ("Yeshua" in Hebrew).*
During the incarnation, when the angel spoke and Mary gave her acceptance, the Word of God became flesh, and divine life (Jesus) entered a pure vessel (Mary) and thus a human (Mary) had a share in the divine life.

Similarly, the incarnational principle is applied when we receive the Bread of Life (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), after giving our acceptance (Amen) and thereafter we receive divine life (2 Peter 1:4).

*He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.*
Angel Gabriel quoted to Mary from God‚Äôs prophecy to David (2 Samuel 7: 12-16).

The angel had just announced to Mary that her son would be the future King in the Davidic kingdom. By default, that made Mary (a descendant of David) (Romans 1:3) the future Queen Mother according to the pattern of the Davidic kingdom.

Luke 1:38
*"May it be done to me according to your Word."*
Surrendering our will to God is NOT when we say *"Lord, I will do as you say."*
Surrendering our will to God is when we say, like Mary, *" may it be done to me, Lord, according to Your Will/Word"* and like Jesus *‚Äú may Your will be done, Lord, not mine‚Äù* (Mark 14:32).

Mary understood that she was only a creature and had no power to carry out God's Will with her human abilities. Whatever God wanted to do through her had to be completely in God's control and power because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is strong resistance from the demonic spirit and humans cannot handle the demons without divine assistance.

This means that when God starts using us to carry out His Will we are bound to go through trials, tribulations, persecution and we may even have to give up our life. The important thing is that through this journey we must ensure that we protect the purity of our soul, and not the safety of our body.

God is Spirit and therefore He prefers to use our bodies to do His Will on earth. Let us surrender ourselves to His Will completely, like Mary and Jesus, irrespective of the storms we will have to face. That is when we trust God.

A godly man will not have marital union with a woman unless he marries her with her whole hearted consent. Angel Gabriel was therefore sent by the Holy Spirit to Mary with a marriage proposal. When Mary gave her consent the Word of God became flesh in her womb and she became the spouse of the Holy Spirit, who works along with her, for the sanctification of the human race, to unite people to the Body of Christ.

Luke 1:40-41
Mary was already filled with the Holy Spirit when the Body of Christ was in her womb, therefore when she spoke the greeting (shalom) she poured out the Holy Spirit onto Elizabeth and onto the baby in Elizabeth‚Äôs womb.
This was the time when John was baptized with the Holy Spirit thereby making him the bridegroom‚Äôs friend or ‚Äúbest man‚Äù who would prepare Israel for the coming of the bridegroom.

Jewish marriages always began with an inaugural dance, and John‚Äôs leaping in the womb was the symbolic dance of the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù to inaugurate the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) in Mary‚Äôs womb.

Similarly, in the infant Church, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and Cornelius and his household were eagerly listening to the Word from Peter, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard Peter (Acts 10:44).

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is automatically poured out onto those who eagerly hear the Word of God from us.

John was in his mother's womb and could not see Jesus in Mary‚Äôs womb, but John recognized the presence of Jesus through the voice of Mary. Jesus spoke through His mother‚Äôs voice.

Let us humble ourselves like Mary so that Jesus can use our voices to speak to others and bless them.

Luke 1:42
Through the power of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth declared that Mary was blessed among all women.

Elizabeth represents all of those who pray the ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù prayer. When we say the prayer, Mary visits us, to help us during our difficult times, just as she did with Elizabeth.

Luke 1:43
It wasn't Elizabeth, but the Holy Spirit, who addressed Mary as the ‚ÄúMother of my Lord‚Äù because neither was Elizabeth informed in advance in any way that Mary was with child nor did Mary explain anything to Elizabeth when she entered the house.

Luke 2:1-2
Emperor Augustus considered himself to be a god and therefore wanted all his subjects to be registered in his kingdom so that he could increase his tax revenue.

But God wants us to be registered with His holy Kingdom (the Church), through baptism, so that we belong to His holy family to be with Him for eternity.

Luke 2:6-7
‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Hebrew means ‚ÄúHouse of Meat‚Äù and Hebrew is the language of the original old Testament books.

During the old Covenant Passover celebration, the congregation had to consume the meat of an earthly lamb.
This was a foreshadow of the Passover of the new Covenant.

‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Greek means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù and Greek is the language of the original new Testament books.

During the new Covenant Passover celebration (the Mass), the congregation has to consume the consecrated unleavened bread (Communion) which is the living mystical Body of the Lamb of God (Luke 22:19; John 6:54).

All this happened according to God‚Äôs plan.
This is how God announced to the world that the Bread of Life (Jesus) was delivered at the House of Bread (Bethlehem) and was already served in the food box (manger) for the world to eat so that we can now have eternal life (John 6:54).

And God, therefore, made sure that David himself was born in Bethlehem.

*There was no room for them in the inn.*
There was no room for them in the inn (or guest houses) due to the influx of people who returned to their home town to enroll themselves. They were therefore rejected by the world.
Rejection by the world can often lead to God‚Äôs greater plan being unveiled.

The inn was a symbol of our hearts.
When our hearts are filled with things of this world we become heartless, selfish and disrespectful and thus there is no room for Jesus in our hearts.

Jesus was born in the stable only because the humble shepherds made room for His mother to bring Him into their home.

Let us ask the mother of Jesus to guide us so that we can humble ourselves to make room in our hearts and she can bring her Son into our homes.

LUKE. 1:5-25
An Angel appears to Zechariah and assured him of his prayers, his wife would bear a child, a son, to be named John.
When his service time was completed, he returned home to see his wife pregnant. There were litany of Praises to Our Awesome God.
His Power to bring fruitfulness, out of fertility and bring God's Will to fulfillment. God manifest His Might, not just by making the impossible possible but building on them His Great Plan of Salvation.

LUKE. 1:26-38
This speaks of Advent, The Lord Enters. He is the King Of Glory.
God's love for humanity is such that, He became like us. He chose His Son to be born through a Virgin, thus fulfilling the Prophecy that is part of God's Plan to save us. So much so that our human plans would fit his designs.
Like Mary, let us say: Let it be done to me as You have said.

##### Day 314 Overcome temptations with prayer and fasting.

At the Baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form and the voice of the Father was heard. ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you, I am well pleased.‚Äù As soon as that happened, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasted and was tempted by the devil in every way.
The new Adam is able to withstand the temptations of the devil, as compared to the Adam. It seems like the three temptations were similar to the ones that Adam faced.

1. Good
   If you are the Son of God, command the stones to become a loaf of bread. Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúIt is written, ‚ÄòOne does not live by bread alone.‚Äô‚Äù
   Jesus being fully human(and fully God) was truly in need of food as He had fasted for 40 days. Satan takes a natural good and twists it to confuse us, to make it seem good. Jesus could have done that Miracle just as he made water into wine, but Jesus could see the evil scheme of the devil. Eve and Adam could not resist the offer of the devil to eat the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.

‚ÄúThe woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes‚Äù Gen 3:6

We also can fall into the temptation of the lust of the eyes, we could say this is really good we should have it.

2. Power
   Then he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.

6The devil said to him, ‚ÄúI shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I may give it to whomever I wish. All this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚ÄòYou shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.‚Äô

Satan tempts Jesus with power. Jesus had not yet won the victory on the cross. Satan wanted to give Jesus a short cut around the Passion and agony that he would need to go through. But Jesus resisted for worship is only due to God, no person or object or thing or power deserves our worship.
Eve and Adam could not resist the temptation of power, they were going to get similar power as God or similar knowledge as God.
‚ÄúGod knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5
We also crave power, we crave to control situations and people. Who does not want their own way in matters. Let us keep it at check and offer all due worship to God, let‚Äôs just seek His will.

3. Distrust
   Then he led him to Jerusalem, made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
   10 for it is written:
   ‚ÄòHe will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,‚Äô and:‚ÄòWith their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.‚Äô‚Äù 12Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòYou shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test‚Äù
   Satan tried to push the buttons of distrust, he was like will not God send his angles when you will fall. So give it a test, try to fall and let‚Äôs see if it's true. Did not work, Jesus like the previous times quoted the scripture and confessed His belief.

Our first parents gave into the distrust ‚Äòtest‚Äô, and gave into doubt.
But the snake said to the woman: ‚ÄúYou certainly will not die!

5God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know\* good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

They were like what is God does not have our best interest in mind? What if God is so selfish that He wants to keep wisdom and power from all, just so that He can rule the world.
Satan will try to sow doubt in your minds, he will bring up a lot of negative thoughts about God. Will God really provide for you? Will he really heal you? Does God really love you, look how terrible you are? Will God really forgive you, you commit this sin over and over again.
We need to fight against these voices and believe the God is Good and loves us beyond our wildest imaginations. What God has for us no eye has seen no ear has heard, for the plans He has for us is for our own good.
Let us fight against temptations of the eyes, flesh and pride but fasting and prayer.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 314 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 3:10-14
*What then should we do?*

As John tells us, the most important thing to do is to repent. We must examine our conscience and correct our errors before repenting. But it is not sufficient only to repent. John tells us that we must prove our faith through works of charity, honesty, and social justice.

We can start by sharing with the less fortunate whatever food and clothes that we have in excess (v. 11) because sharing is fundamental to our faith, not only after repentance, but always.
John tells us that whatever job we do we must do it with honesty (v. 13).
We must not let greed control us (v. 14).
Whatever we do we must do it to please God.

One of the prominent marks in today‚Äôs world is the absence of guilt for sins, thus minimizing repentance or almost eliminating it. Most people feel repentance is old fashioned. Others make a show of repentance for personal gain. Yet others may say a robotic ‚Äúsorry‚Äù only when they are caught. But repentance is more than just saying robotic words or reading prayers of repentance from a book. Repentance means turning around from our material lives, detaching ourselves from earthly bondage and following Christ with our whole heart.

John tells us to prepare our hearts to welcome the Lord. He wants us to discard all the obstacles which block us from following Christ.
To prepare the way for the Lord in our hearts we must focus on the fundamentals of our faith which are *‚Äúrepentance, sharing and serving.‚Äù*

Luke 3:21-22
*The Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.

Original sin is the loss of divine life within us, which gives us sanctifying grace to perfect our souls and enables us to enter Heaven and stand in the presence of God.

When Jesus was baptised the Holy Spirit descended on the Son in the presence of the Father.

Likewise, when we are baptized we receive the life of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (divine life) within us. And whenever we destroy this divine life with our sins we can have it restored by receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace (Sacrament of Reconciliation / Confession), because we are baptized.

The old Covenant people did not have this privilege because their baptism was symbolic, not sacramental.

Luke 3:23
Like Matthew, Luke also focuses on the royal lineage of Jesus.
Matthew shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Solomon through Jacob, but Luke shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Nathan through Heli.

How could this be possible?

The Levirate law allowed a woman to marry a brother of her ex-husband (in the case of divorce), or the brother of her deceased husband (in the case of widowhood), even if, in both cases, the men already had children. However, if the men, in both cases, did not have a brother or if the brother refused to marry her, then the woman was allowed to marry the next of kin of her previous husband, as in the case of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 4:13).

Joseph had a natural father (Jacob) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Solomon, and a legal father (Heli) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Nathan.

How could Jacob and his brother Heli have two different fathers?

Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha first married Matthan (a descendant of Solomon) and they became the parents of Jacob.

After the death of Matthan Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha then married Melchi (a descendant of Nathan, but of the same tribe) and they became the parents of Heli.

Heli married Joseph‚Äôs mother but he died without leaving any children.

Thereafter his brother Jacob married Joseph's mother and they became the parents of Joseph.

In short:
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the natural line were David > Solomon >>>> Matthan > Jacob.
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the legal line were David > Nathan >>>> Melchi > Heli.

It was important to protect the genealogical line of the Messiah because in order to be the Messiah, he had to be the prophetic ‚ÄúLion of the Tribe of Judah‚Äù (Genesis 49:10) and the ‚Äúroot of David‚Äù (2 Samuel 7:13-14; (Revelation 5:5).

This is the main reason (among others) for the careful inclusions of the genealogies in both the Old and New Covenants.
It stresses the fact that the existence of these genealogies are not the result of human effort or holiness; they are wholly dependent upon the power of God that guarantees them.

Therefore, inspite of Satan‚Äôs efforts through the rebellion of all the ungrateful humans, God has still kept His promise of a Savior for the world from the line of Seth through Judah to Jesus.

Luke 4:1-12
Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us to remind us which scripture we can apply to a particular situation.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.

Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc. How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test. If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Jesus could have told the devil to go away but He did not because that would not be a good model for humans. Due to the weakness of our souls we cannot beat the tricky and deceptive forces of evil on our own. Jesus quoted scripture to overcome the devil to show us that we too must follow the same.

Luke 4:3 & 9
*Then the devil came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, ........*

Satan didn't say "if you are the prophet, priest or king......."
Satan was directly attacking the family relation between Jesus and His heavenly Father by challenging Jesus to defy His Father.

Satan tried the same trick with Adam and Eve by asking them, "did God say.......?"
He twisted the Word of God, poisoned their minds against God their Father and succeeded in making them challenge God by disobeying Him.

Similarly, since all baptized people are the children of God, Satan will always try in many ways to tempt us with power, wealth, possessions, comfort, entertainment, etc. and by twisting the Word of God, to separate us from our heavenly Father.

Let us always be alert to the devil's tricks by reading the Word of God every day, daily prayers, obeying God's commandments in our daily lives, and regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion).

Humans are created in the image and likeness of God therefore family and human identity has been the devil's target.

Adam and Eve's minds were poisoned against God who created them.

In today‚Äôs world, divorces are increasing and young children are being brainwashed into believing that they can choose to belong to any gender they wish, if they are not happy with their gender.

Luke 4:3-12
Jesus began His public ministry with both prayer and fasting. This is a good formula for us in our lives.

Before we take any action, we should start with prayer, asking for God‚Äôs guidance and His Will in our lives.

Fasting is also beneficial for each one of us. When unchecked, our passions begin to rule us. However, by fasting and self-denial, we are reminding our passions of who is the boss. We then become more free to direct our lives towards what is truly good, and free to follow the good Lord more closely.

Luke 4:6
*"All these kingdoms have been handed over to me, and all this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù*
When the world was created, it belonged to Jesus in its sanctified form and it was handed over to Adam to rule over it. But when Adam made a Covenant with Satan by disobeying God and eating the forbidden fruit, Adam automatically transferred his dominion to Satan, and thus Satan became the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30), which is why the power of evil was greater than the power of good, in the old Covenant. We, the baptized ones, are now God's people living in an enemy occupied territory (the world).

Satan was telling Jesus that Jesus would get back all what initially belonged to Him, only if Jesus worshipped Satan.

Jesus didn't need Satan to hand the kingdoms of the world over to Him. By His holy life, death and resurrection, Jesus gave us access to the fruit of life (the consecrated bread / Eucharist) and thus got us back the authority to rule over God's kingdom on earth (the Church) which Satan is trying to corrupt and destroy, internally and externally, just as he deceived Adam and Eve into destroying the sanctified world.

Luke 4:13
Although Jesus passed every test, Satan was not done with Jesus. Satan was alert 24x7x12 waiting for a chance to trap Jesus again. Throughout the ministry of Jesus we see Satan using the people around Jesus to overpower or destroy Jesus by their accusations, attempts to attack, tricky questions, etc.

When we have defeated the devil once, we cannot remain off-guard thinking that he will not attack us again. Satan has a million ways of tricking people. Whatever we are focused on, Satan will use that to lead us away from God, smoothly, without us having the slightest doubt that we are on the wrong path. That is where our daily communication with God through prayers and reading the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes, will help us.

Let us stay alert to sin, pray every day for divine assistance and ensure that we read the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes

Luke 5:3
The crowds represent the flock of Christ and the boat represents the Church, the Ark of God.
Jesus still speaks to His flock (the faithful Christians) from Simon's boat (the Church).

Luke 5:4
If we have tried sharing the Word of God with others, or doing other works for God, and failed in our mission, the Lord maybe just training us and preparing us to venture further into difficult areas. Let us move ahead without hesitation because THE LORD WANTS US TO DO IT.

Luke 5:6
When we venture further into difficult areas in obedience to the Lord, inspite of our failures, the Lord will bless our efforts with so much abundance that we may not be able to handle it on our own and we may need assistance from our family, friends, relatives, colleagues, or anyone else.

##### The Virtue of Mercy

[![The Virtue of Mercy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day315.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tHwiu0_6paw "The Virtue of Mercy")

##### Day 315 Faith and Love

We see some great examples of faith, the Roman centurion whose servant was sick. The Centurion sent word for Jesus to come to his home but later realized that he was not worthy to have a holy man enter his house, so he went out to meet Jesus and petitioned the Lord with great words of faith.

And Jesus went with them, but when he was only a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, ‚ÄúLord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof.
7Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed.
8For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô and he goes; and to another, ‚ÄòCome here,‚Äô and he comes; and to my slave, ‚ÄòDo this,‚Äô and he does it.‚Äù
9When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and, turning, said to the crowd following him, ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
10When the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave in good health. Luke 7:6-10
We sometimes underestimate the power of God, we think that the Lord will work one way but do not realize that God just has to say a word and things will happen. We need to have faith when we pray, it should touch the heart of Jesus just as the centurion‚Äôs words did. Jesus should respond to our prayer ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
Along with faith we should also have love for the Lord. We see the example of Mary
A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee‚Äôs house and reclined at table.
37Now there was a sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an alabaster flask of ointment,
38she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment.
39When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself, ‚ÄúIf this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.‚Äù
40Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúSimon, I have something to say to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me, teacher,‚Äù he said.
41‚ÄúTwo people were in debt to a certain creditor; one owed five hundred days‚Äô wages\* and the other owed fifty.
42Since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both. Which of them will love him more?‚Äù
43Simon said in reply, ‚ÄúThe one, I suppose, whose larger debt was forgiven.‚Äù He said to him, ‚ÄúYou have judged rightly.‚Äù
44Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, ‚ÄúDo you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give me water for my feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
45You did not give me a kiss, but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered.
46You did not anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with ointment.
47So I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.‚Äù
48He said to her, ‚ÄúYour sins are forgiven.‚Äù
49The others at table said to themselves, ‚ÄúWho is this who even forgives sins?‚Äù
50But he said to the woman, ‚ÄúYour faith has saved you; go in peace.‚Äù

We see the beautiful expression of love that the sinful woman, many believe is Mary Magdalene. She had such love for the Lord that she didn‚Äôt hesitate to pour out costly ointment on his feet. How is our love for the Lord, do we love like the Pharisees or like the sinner? Do we love Jesus less or love Him more. Do we give to the poor and the church a little of our time, talent and treasure or give it freely.
Let us pray that we should have both faith and love for our dear Lord Jesus. Let us have faith believing that Jesus can do anything for us and love Him unendingly, I don‚Äôt know about you but I feel that Jesus has forgiven me a lot of my sins. He died for me and loves me dearly.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Absolute Surrender

[![Absolute Surrender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day316.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fJ4gt4sW5Y4 "Absolute Surrender")

##### Day 316 Deny yourself and come follow me.

Many people come to Jesus for a reason, they either want to be healed or receive a favor. Jesus wants to heal and provide for us but He wants something more, a loving and living relationship. Jesus invites us to this beautiful relationship, like one of a shepherd and the sheep. Jesus calls the 12 and gives them authority to drive out demons and to heal the sick. When they return Jesus does more Miracles like the feeding of the 5000. He later sends out the 72 who are able to heal and deliver people from demon possession. What is more important than doing works for the Lord is knowing the Lord.

That is why Jesus asked His disciples Who do you say I am? To which Peter replied ‚ÄúThe Messiah of God.‚Äù We are called to discover Christ first before we decide to go out and do works for Him.

In discovering Christ we will have our moments of Transfiguration where Jesus will reveal Himself to us so that we will know that our God is the creator of the world, all-powerful, all-knowing and every loving.

Once we realize who calls us and what is our mission, we will be able to deny ourselves daily and pickup our cross and follow Jesus.

Then he said to all, ‚ÄúIf anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
24For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
25What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself?
26Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Luke 9:23-26

We are called to lose our life, keep our pride by the side, speak about Jesus openly with our friends and family. Take a stand for Jesus in the anti-life culture.

We sometimes like Peter, John and James may want to remain on Spiritual highs, build booths at the transfiguration and not come back to reality. Or like Martha, we may get overly anxious of the worries and cares of the day, that we so forget the Lord. One thing is needed and we should choose that. That is to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to every word He says.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Persistence in Prayer

[![Persistence in Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day317.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1Cq89cCv0SA "Persistence in Prayer")

##### Day 317 Do not be anxious about tomorrow.

Most of us are such control freaks when it comes to our lives. We have our schedules booked out months in advance and holidays a year in advance. We know when we would upgrade our next iphone and when we should retire. Although it‚Äôs good to plan it‚Äôs not good to worry about things of the future. We are called to have dependence on God, rather than depending on our abilities and securities.
Dependence on God.

He said to \[his\] disciples, ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear.
23For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
24Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds!
25Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span?
26If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you anxious about the rest?
Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them.
28If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?
29As for you, do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not worry anymore.
30All the nations of the world seek for these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
31Instead, seek his kingdom, and these other things will be given you besides.
32Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
33Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.
34For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. Luke 12:22-34

I could not help but put the whole test from Luke, as it has been therapeutic each time I read it. Whenever you are stressed about the future and are not sure of what you will eat or drink or stay. Remember that God the Father feeds the birds of the air and the clothes the lilies of the field.

We are called to be rely on God alone and not on our own abilities and strengths. No matter how strong, rich, powerful or famous you may be today, it all can be taken away in a second. We need to remember that everything we have now is only a gift from God, for all good things comes from the Lord. We need not be overly concerned about storing up riches on earth, we should instead focus on storing up riches in heaven. Doing good deeds and living a good life with Jesus at the center. We should be like the 5 wise virgins who stored up extra oil, the good deeds. We should make for us bags that we can carry into heaven, something that cannot be stolen from us, it becomes an inexhaustible treasure.
But what to do when worries and anxieties knock on our door, we should pray. Pray the prayer Jesus taught us, Our Father. Just these words should be good enough to suppress all worries, for if God is our Father there is nothing we shall fear for if God is for us who can be against us. We should pray for our daily bread, and also be fed by the Eucharist every day ‚Äúthe‚Äù daily bread.

Let us know fear or worry, for each of the hairs on our head has been numbered.
Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. Luke 12:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 317 By Sheila

Luke 11:15-26.
Jesus is accused of serving and doing evil by evil's power. Yet all what Jesus does is good. Healing, curing, forgiving, giving people food, hope and good news.
Jesus warns that there will be a day of Judgment for them and we must be careful that we have not become evil ourselves. All is just fine that all is well because we believe in God.
Are we mindful of other's goodness or are we always looking for evil.

Luke 11:27-28.
While Jesus was speaking the Word of God, a woman spoke from the crowd in blessing and in truth. Blessing for the woman who gave birth and nursed You as a child. Jesus refuses, and says, NO. Rather blessed is the one who hears the Word of God and keeps it. This is more important than any blessings, any relationship of human kingship, marriage, family and parents.
He adds, we are given birth in the Word of God and we must make sure that this WORD grows within us.

##### BIAY Day 317 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 11:1
*Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.‚Äù*
Prayer is not about giving God information or changing his mind. Prayer is an activity which God wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.

By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

We usually remember John the Baptist as a baptizer who called people to repent. But here the Bible tells us that John was a man of prayer and he also had his own disciples, some of whom, we know, followed Jesus.

Luke 11:3
*Give us this day our daily bread.*
We ask God, not only for our earthly bread but, also for our supernatural / consecrated bread, the Body of Christ (epi ousios in Greek) to keep our souls nourished as long as we live on earth.

Luke 11:4
*And forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sinned against us.*
‚ÄúForgive our offenders‚Äù does not mean that we must free them if they are in the custody of the authorities for a crime. "Forgive our offenders" means we make a petition to God from our hearts, to forgive them, thus confirming that we have no grudge against our offenders in our hearts. This action from us allows God's grace to flow through us to convert them.
*Lead us not into temptation / to the final test).*
God does not tempt people (James 1:13). God allows the devil to tempt us for the purpose of testing our faith (Revelation 2:10; James 1:12), just as it was with Jesus (Matthew 4:1).

Luke 11:5-8
Persistent prayer purifies our body (tongue) and mind (thoughts), and strengthens our soul. We must pray continuously (1 Thessalonians 5:17), even if we have to repeat the same prayer over and over again (Matthew 26:44; Mark 14:39). Praying repeatedly is not for the purpose of getting what we want but to purify ourselves and strengthen ourselves spiritually.

Persistent prayer is like pushing a large rock. Our duty is to keep pushing, even if it takes days, months or years and the rock doesn't move, and even if we are criticized or mocked for our futile persistence. God will move the rock when the time is right.

Luke 11:9-10
Jesus didn't promise us that we will receive what we *want* (material gifts) whenever we ask, search or knock. God is not a vending machine to give us whatever material gifts we ask for. He provides us with our daily needs even if we don‚Äôt ask for it. God is more interested in the purity of our souls and love for our neighbor to make us worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore Jesus wants us to focus on asking for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13) to help us so that we can use our spiritual gifts how God wants us to.

Luke 11:14-23
Let us be alert to the Beelzebuls in our lives who try to create divisions between us and our family, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc. If they can't do it with violence they may come as humble, loving, friendly people in our lives and convince us to do something ungodly against the wishes of our family members.
Or they may want us to choose between two friends / relatives / colleagues /neighbours / etc. who are at war with each other.
If we live in obedience to God we will be able to recognize these Beelzebuls, control them and maintain our relationship with others.
Let us take the demons in our lives to Jesus so that He can cast them out by helping us to live in total obedience to God.

Jesus acknowledged that the Jews performed valid exorcisms (Luke 11:19).

Luke 11:24-26
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc. A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don‚Äôt keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying. We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Let us keep our focus fixed on God and continue pleasing Him in all we do and say, while we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us.

Luke 11:27-28
A woman is not blessed just because she bears children in her womb and nurses them; she is blessed only when she hears the Word of God and obeys it.
Mary was the first Christian who heard the Word of God through the Angel Gabriel and obeyed it, even before Jesus was born (Luke 1:38).
Mary was the first Christian who accepted Jesus in her life as her God and Saviour, even before He was born (Luke 1:47).

Jesus didn‚Äôt want His mother to be blessed only because she bore Him in her womb and nursed Him. Billions of women have borne children in their wombs and nursed them. Instead, He blessed her for her knowledge of the scriptures and her obedience to God, even though she knew she could be stoned to death, which was the reason why He was able to come into this world and thus fulfill God‚Äôs divine plan for redemption of humanity.
Jesus was therefore blessing His own Mother for hearing the Word of God and obeying it, just as Elizabeth too had blessed her three decades earlier (Luke 1:45).

Luke 11:34-36
One example of not using our eyes positively is ‚Äúgender confusion‚Äù where the person wants to look like the opposite gender.
A person's gender reveals how that person will contribute to bring forth new life. This is the theology of the body. Therefore, when we interfere with the biology of the body we end up interfering with the theology of the body.
At best we can only reconstruct the outer appearance of a person wanting to re-assign his/her gender but no human can create the life-giving elements inside the newly modified body. They can only castrate themselves to stop production of the existing life-giving elements.
The diabolic forces don't want humans to understand the beauty of the human body and therefore they confuse humans with gender identity.
Thus, if our eyes cannot see the beauty in God‚Äôs creation then we will be living in total darkness.

Luke 11:41
*But as to what is within, give alms and everything will be clean for you.*
Almsgiving is an antidote for wickedness and greed.

Luke 12:13-15
It was a normal practice for the Jews to seek assistance from the Rabbis in the matter of disputes.
Family disputes for property and possessions arise out of greed and avarice which Jesus was preaching against. Jesus wants people to focus on their heavenly inheritance, not their earthly inheritance.

Luke 12:16-21
6 times the rich man said "I."
4 times he said "my."
In the entire parable there is neither any thanksgiving to God for the abundance of crop nor even any mention of God.

When our hearts are filled with greed we think only about "I, me myself and mine‚Äù because we make ourselves the gods and our desire will be to please only ourselves. We neither think about others nor do we think about God.

In today‚Äôs world we may not have barns to store up our goods but we put too much faith in our money and possessions and we believe that if we hoard sufficient wealth and possessions in this world then we are secure so we don't need God or His commandments and we don't even need to go to Church. Thus we will spend our time focusing on the less important things and miss out on what is more important for our eternal life.

God blesses us with abundance, not because He wants us to hoard the excess, but, because He wants us to share the excess with the less fortunate ones.
Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and all the rest will be given to you (Matthew 6:33).

True wealth is spiritual wealth or being rich towards God. A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
Let us therefore not waste our time slogging all day long to acquire more than what we need and thus end the day with no time and energy left for God.

Let us not forget to give thanks to God in everything.

Luke 12:31
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers.
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly (at least once or twice a year) if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God‚Äôs Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Luke 12:33-34
Anxiety about earthly things should not be the behavior of a Christian. It is a pagan behavior. Christians who trust in God will not be worried about earthly possessions.
Our treasury of material wealth on earth can be lost if it is stolen or destroyed by insects or worms, but our treasury of spiritual wealth can never be stolen or destroyed because it will be guarded in Heaven by the Lord. The only possible way we can lose our spiritual wealth is if we choose to follow the devil's ways.

Luke 12:48
*From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required;*
In the new Covenant, we have been given the power of the Holy Spirit to help us keep the new law (John 15:12). Therefore, we have no excuse to bring Heaven on earth by loving, caring for and sharing with the people around us in obedience to the new commandment (John 15:12).

Luke 12:57-59
Christians must resolve their disputes within the community with peace, love and understanding, because they belong to God‚Äôs holy Kingdom and they are supposed to follow the new Covenant law of love. Christians must therefore not take their disputes outside the community to the pagan courts.

##### The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son

[![The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day318.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uRbeK7f4QKM "The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son")

##### Day 318 The real Prodigal son

We read the parable of the Lost sheep, where Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes in search of the lost sheep that tried to get away from the flock. We need to know that God is always reaching out to us and willing to come find us no matter how evil or lost we may be.

Just as the woman in the parable of the Lost Coin, God is always searching for us, doing everything (she lights a lamp, sweeps the whole house, and searches until she finds it). We need to be more open to the voice of the Lord and be aware of the different opportunities we are presented to know God.

In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, we read about the younger son who demands his share of the property. According to most customs in the world today and more so back in Jesus times, the property was only received as a gift from the parents after they passed away.
The younger son's demand for the property is highly insulting, subtly suggesting that he wishes his father would hurry up and die. He said ‚ÄúGive me the property that belongs to me‚Äù, first of all, that is a gift and a gift cannot be demanded.

This is similar to what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden, they took for themselves what they wanted. They did not wait for God to give them the gift but wanted to snatch it and become equals to God in wisdom.
I feel that the second son also falls into this category when he wants to demand and take something for himself and for his friends.
All these years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never once disobeyed your orders. Even so, you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Luke 15:29

The words ‚Äúslave‚Äù and ‚Äúorder‚Äù are not words that a son would say. The second son although always with the father has not understood his relationship with the father. He considers himself a slave and not a son.

The younger son went off to a far-off country, away from the father's care but also away from any boundaries, beliefs, or rules of the father. The elder son although physically present with the father, internally separated himself from the father's care and had a broken/misunderstood relationship with the father.

When the younger son squandered all his money on dissolute living and famine hit, he had no choice but to work for a citizen of the far of country, the job any Jew would despise, feeding the swine. As he went far from his father‚Äôs house, he stripped himself of all his spiritual practices and did things that he would have never dreamt of doing.

Most of us have been in this place in our lives, we have wasted all the blessings God has given us, and we do the worst things we can think of - go to that extent that we once never even imagined we would.

But the important part of the story is when the son came to the realization of his identity as the son and this helped him discover who his father was. He says in my father's house even the servants are treated well, he probably remembers all the years of his life, the goodness of his father.

He decides to go back to his father‚Äôs house, repent from his bad ways and be a servant in his father‚Äôs house.

The father was waiting for his son, on the lookout every day. Now it was uncommon to see an elderly Jewish father run to their children, it was usually the other way around as the elders were highly respected. God comes running to us even though we don‚Äôt deserve it, it is true. If we ask why would God who created the world even bother with a sinner like me, we have not understood the heart of God.

When the father sees the son, his poor condition. The souls of his feet must have been worn out due to the long travel barefoot, but more importantly his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù was in bad shape. He had lived a very poor spiritual life which would have caused him to feel like a slave unworthy of the father's love.

The father sees it all, he places sandals on his feet, a ring on his figure and a robe on him. He restores the son back as an heir, the sandals are a symbol of a freeman, the ring symbolizes authority as a son, and the robe symbolizes that his dignity was restored. The prodigal son is now restored back to being the son of the father.
God the Father invites each of us back, we are His children.

To the dismay of everyone, the actual prodigal son is the elder son, who lived with the father all along but did not live as a son. He considered himself a slave and demanded his rights, though he was following the orders of his father.
We may identify with the elder son, we call ourselves Christians but crib about the commandments we are called to follow. We complain about the church teachings and are intolerant to our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We get irritable when we do not get our prayers answered, we are trying to work our way up to heaven "mentality of following his orders" instead of loving his word. We are grudgingly saying ‚ÄúI followed all your orders, you did not give me a calf to celebrate with my friends.‚Äù We are envious of others and so proud that we hate to see someone do better than us, even in church circles.

We are all prodigal sons, some choose to repent and some don‚Äôt. Let us run to the arms of the Father. Who is waiting for us, searching for us, and coming after us like the good Shepherd.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### DAY 318 By Sheila

Luke 13:18-19 The Kingdom of God - Jesus' Power and Presence in the World. It is like a mustard seed, so tiny, so as to be unnoticed. But once it is planted it can take over an entire field, just as it is meant to take over our lives and the lives of all around us. It grows to be a sheltering presence for others.

Luke 14:1, 7-11 Most of the early members of the Church were Jews. Jesus was a Jew but many in Israel did not come to believe that Jesus was the awaited Messiah because He was more than that, more than what was awaited - He was GOD. For those who believe that He is the fullness of the promises, the law and the hopes of all the years of waiting.
Now God in Jesus belongs to every tribe and Nation. But Israel is beloved of God always. They were His First people, His dearest treasure and God's gifts are irrevocable. We must be careful not to let others words influence negatively how we feel and relate to people. Our lives must reveal the Presence of God in Jesus, Crucified and Risen. We must live humbly, truthfully and with respect for all.

##### BIAY Day 318 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 13:3
*No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.*
The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower, all died physical or natural death. But Jesus was talking about spiritual death.

The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower tragedy perished physically. But if we don't repent for our sins then we will perish spiritually.

Sometimes bad things may happen to us for reasons we don‚Äôt understand but best known to God, and we may have to suffer for the sins of others. Therefore, it is always wise to repent and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that such misfortunes may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death because death can come to us anytime, anywhere.

Luke 13:6-9
The fig tree is a familiar Old Testament symbol for Israel (Jeremiah 24:1‚Äì10). As the fig tree is given one last season to produce fruit before it is cut down, so too Jesus is giving Israel one final opportunity to bear good fruits as evidence of its repentance (Luke 3:8).
It was three years since Jesus started His Ministry and He didn't see any positive changes in most of the people.
We are created by the heavenly Gardner to be producers of good fruit. But like the fig tree, if we don't produce good fruit then our end will be like that of the fig tree.
Jesus is telling us that God is patient with us and gives us plenty of time to repent and start producing good fruit. Let us make use of that time to get closer to God do His Kingdom work.
A fig tree normally takes 3 years to produce fruits. Inspite of constant watering and nourishment the fig tree did not produce fruits so the gardener requested for more time.
A repentant sinner is God‚Äôs prize possession therefore God will not give up on anyone who struggles to come back to Him inspite of all the spiritual nourishment, but He will not wait indefinitely.

Luke 13:10-17
Jesus deliberately healed the crippled woman on the Sabbath, not to challenge the religious authorities of the synagogue, but to show them and everyone else that Sabbath rest was not given to humans to become slaves of the law, but to begin the day with holiness and good works of mercy, because the rest if the week they were busy with their daily duties, caring for their families and earning their living.

In the new Covenant also the Sabbath rest is given to us also for the same reason. Sabbath rest is a reminder for us of our eternal rest with God. Therefore we must spend the day with holiness by worshipping the Lord (Mass) and then focusing on good work for the community so that God can use us to help the less fortunate ones.

The religious authorities didn't see the leading of an animal to the water as work but they saw healing a helpless human as work. They valued animals and ignored the less fortunate humans when in fact they should have given priority to the needs of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and then attended to the animals.

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt give too much preference to our pets and ignore the humans in need. Let us give priority to the needs of God‚Äôs children and then attend to our pets.

Luke 14:7-14
Jesus was not giving advise on how and with whom we must socialize.
And sitting at the lowest place is not a trick for getting promoted.
While Jesus was literally speaking about humility of guests at a feast (Proverbs 25:6‚Äì7), He was also applying the same principle to us (the guests) at the heavenly marriage feast.

When we attend the marriage feast of the Lamb (the Mass) in Church every Sunday, we must approach the Altar, with humility, not with pride (Sirach 3:17-20).
The Altar on earth represents the Altar in Heaven (the Body of Christ) therefore what we do on earth during worship is what we will be doing in Heaven and there is no place in Heaven for pride.

Jesus was telling the host of the feast that feeding the well-fed people is not as pleasing to God as feeding the less fortunate ones. In other words, don‚Äôt invite those who can afford to invite you in return.
God gives us success in our material life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones. By this we practice generosity which is very pleasing to God and our generosity must always be a one-way act.

Let us glorify the Lord by being merciful to the less fortunate ones and releasing them from bondage of poverty and suffering, remembering that we ourselves were once ransomed from bondage of sin by the price of His Blood (1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20).

Our natural human tendency is to always look for our benefits when we give alms or do some good work. But if we get our reward in this life, then we will not get our reward from God after this life. Our reward in this life may be in the form of publicity, favours, recognition, praise, etc.

Luke 14:26
*Whoever comes to me and does not hate Father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.*
Jesus is not asking us to despise our family members or create barriers between us and them.
Jesus is telling us not to get attached to our family members and the pleasures of this life because if we do get attached then He will become secondary in our lives and humans and the pleasures of this life will become primary and that will give Satan the opportunity to start controlling our lives, thereby destroying our souls.
Jesus wants us to detach ourselves from the desires and pleasures of this life and make Him the ruler of our lives so that in whatever we do and say we please Jesus and not humans.

Luke 15:5
*When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.*
A shepherd keeps the strayed sheep on his shoulder because when a sheep goes astray it is helpless and frightened and therefore it doesn't move on its own even if prodded.
We too are like the sheep when we go away from God and fall into a crisis.

Luke 15:10
*In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.*
Heaven rejoices when we make a good confession.
Just as there is great rejoicing in Heaven over every repentant sinner, there is also much sorrow in Heaven when a righteous person goes away from God.
Whenever we lose our near and dear ones or something of great value, we are filled with sorrow or grief.
Through our feelings for the lost things or people on earth, God shows us how He feels for every soul that is lost (goes to Hell).
Jesus gave His life for us to save us from going to Hell. Let us, therefore, not be the cause of our Lord‚Äôs grief.

Luke 15:11-32
The Prodigal son left the place of sin and returned to his father's house. He did not buy a house in the foreign land with the intention of going back to that sinful life again during his vacation.
Repenting for our sins for convenience purpose, with the intention of going back to our sinful life, is not true repentance.

The Prodigal son abandoned his father's house, it led him into a sinful life which brought him misery, then he repented and returned and the father welcomed him with great joy.
All these steps are the process of conversion of a sinner.

The Prodigal son was an image of Israel.
The Israelites had left their home (Canaan) to go to a far-off foreign land (Egypt). They enjoyed life for a while, then they were subject to slavery followed by difficult times in the desert but finally they reached the promised land (Israel) and were happy.
Likewise the Prodigal son is also an image of us.

This parable has a sacramental principle.
Our earthly inheritance is a shadow of our heavenly inheritance (Baptism).
In both cases the inheritance is a gift, not our right. We don‚Äôt do anything to earn our inheritance.
Like our earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is also handed down to us by our parents, guardians or elders through baptism. But during our lifetime we separate ourselves from our heavenly Father by blending with the pagan world and committing mortal sins, and thereby squandering our heavenly inheritance. Thus, we become ritually unclean. To return to our heavenly Father we must repent and confess our sins. Thereafter our heavenly Father will renew the broken Covenant (signet ring) when we make atonement for our sins by offering the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ during Mass.

In this parable, Jesus teaches us that our heavenly Father is not looking to condemn us or to find fault with us, but rather is a Merciful Father, who is looking for our return, ready to welcome and embrace us.
Even though we may be unfaithful to Him, God is always faithful to us. Our Father wants us to have the fullness of life in Himself.

The Parable of the Prodigal Son reminds us of the emptiness of leaving God, choosing our own way. The Lord wants to restore to us what is lost. He is the One who runs to us, looking for the least opening in our hearts, so that He can welcome us back into the family.
Each time that we return to confess our sins and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, our Father accepts us back into the fold with more love than we can imagine.
Let us always turn to our Merciful Father, as He offers His love so freely to us.

The younger son was not only feeding the unclean pigs but he also wanted to eat what they were eating, In the Jewish world, no one could get more lower than where this young man had reached in his sinful life. But even that son was accepted by the compassionate father when he repented. The son had, however, repented because he had reached a point of total despair.

However much we may have enjoyed living a sinful or ungodly life when times were good, it is only when we reach that desperate ‚Äúpig pen‚Äù experience that we realize we can be truly happy only in our Father‚Äôs house (the Church).

When we hear this parable, most of us get sentimental and conclude that, inspite of the conflicts, the father and sons united and they lived happily ever after. But Jesus doesn‚Äôt conclude with a happy ending. Jesus doesn‚Äôt even tell us what happened in the end. And the Pharisees didn‚Äôt really get sentimental after hearing this parable. On the contrary, they were offended (Luke 16:14-15). Jesus was telling them that their image of God was wrong.

The prodigal younger son already had a fight with the father some months ago and left the house after taking his share. Upon his return, when the father threw a party in celebration, it gave rise to a new conflict.

Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life. And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.

Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.
Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life. And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.
Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.

Jesus first told the people the parable of the lost sheep where the shepherd went out and brought it back (Luke 15:3-7).
Next he told them about the parable of the lost coin where the owner of the house started looking for the coin all over the place until she found it (Luke 15:8-10).
In this third parable Jesus talks about a rebellious son leaving the father‚Äôs home but nobody went to bring him back.
When the younger brother left his father‚Äôs house, a really good older brother would have assured the father ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry father, I will go and look for my brother and bring him back home even if it costs me my life‚Äù.
After dividing the property, everything the father owned was now the property of the older son. So when the father wanted to have a feast the older son had to pay the price for everything including the robe, the ring, the shoes and the feast. For the younger son everything was free, but to take part in the feast, he had to repent and humble himself.

We, the human race, are like the younger brother, the prodigal son. We needed an older brother to pay the price for our sins, so that we can take part in the feast (Mass /Eucharistic meal / Communion) with our Father without paying for anything. But to take part in the feast, we, the younger ones, have to repent and humble ourselves first so that we can be in a state of grace before sharing in the Eucharistic meal / Communion (1 Corinthians 11:27).

The prodigal brother, unfortunately, got a Pharisee for an older brother. But we are truly blessed because for us there is a true older brother and Jesus paid that price for us at the cost of his life, to protect us from the enemy so that we could come back to the Father‚Äôs House (the Church) and take part in the marriage supper of the Lamb (Communion).
On the Cross, Jesus paid a debt he did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay. If we understood the depth of what Jesus did for us, it would melt us, move us and change our lives completely, and we would be true Christians.

Luke 16:8
*And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly;*
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewd response to the crisis.

*The children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.*
The Steward used material goods to gain friendship but the children of light (God's people) must use spiritual goods (love, peace, prayer, etc.) or sacrifice their material goods to gain friendship.
The Steward also forgave the people what they owed the master, like the priest who forgives the sinners who owe the heavenly Master an infinite debt when they sin.
Similarly, we too must forgive our offenders in order to gain their friendship and erase all enmity.

Luke 16:19-31
Lazarus went to the righteous side of Purgatory / Sheol / Hades, and thereafter to Heaven because he had gone through suffering when he was on the earth, and the rich man went to the unrighteous side of Purgatory, and thereafter to Hell because he had not shared his abundant blessings with Lazarus.
The rich man had committed the sin of omission.

The rich man had neither murdered Lazarus, nor had he tortured Lazarus in any way. He had not even spoken a harsh word to Lazarus, and yet he was destined for eternal damnation (Hell).

Jesus again reminds us how important it is to be generous with the less fortunate ones. But this time He tells us how serious it is if we neglect them.

Even if we have fulfilled all our religious obligations faithfully, God is first going to check whether or not we have been merciful towards our neighbor (Matthew 25:41-43).
If there are poor, needy and oppressed people around us, specially in our community, then it only means that we are not doing our duty as Christians.

The rich man symbolizes Israel‚Äôs failure to keep the old Covenant, and to heed the commandments of Moses and the prophets. Like the rich man and Israel, we too will lose our inheritance if we fail to give to the poor and needy.

It is not wrong to be rich. But it is wrong if we don‚Äôt use our wealth to help the less fortunate ones.
We need to be good stewards of what God has given us while we focus on our holiness.
Sins of omission are as serious as sins of commission.

Separation or exile from God is what causes the people to burn in Hell because they do not possess the sanctifying grace which gives them the power to stand in the presence of God‚Äôs glory which stretches from Heaven to Hell. Suffering on earth due to sins is only a small demonstration of Hell.

Jesus may have deliberately used the name "Lazarus" for the poor man, but did not name the rich man, because even after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38-44; Luke 16:31), the enemies of Jesus did not want to accept Jesus as the Messiah. Instead, they were plotting to kill Lazarus because Jesus was becoming more popular after raising Lazarus from the dead (John 12:9-11).

[![Come, Follow Me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day319.jpg)](https://youtu.be/coaraYWTJTM "Come, Follow Me")

##### DAY 319 By Sheila

Luke 17: 11-19 The Word of God warns leaders of the World that they will be judged, not as individuals but for all the effects of their collective actions/decisions in the World. God judgments will be swift and terrible in those whose choices disobeyed the Laws of God and disregarded the care of the people and the lives of all.
Jesus heals ten lepers, all of them, all of us in our Church, Communities. He commands that we do what is necessary according to the Law, so that we can live in Society and contribute to it. But only one give thanks, only one acknowledges Jesus' Power and Goodness and Blessed God. And this person was not even a believer. Does God look at all of us (the other nine) and says, "Where Are You? "

Luke 18: 1-8 God's Word has bounded down from the Heavens in the stillness of Night and this Word is a sharp sword that brings death and new life, either decreeing freedom and life and awe before God, or death for those who stand against God's Will.
This is what happened at the Red Sea and we believe, this has happened in The Word become flesh among us in Jesus, the Lord.
We are to pray and reflect upon the Word of the Lord and let it transform us and call us to account in our own lives.
It has been so since the beginning. Would Our God find us faithful or would He find us with the unjust of the World, only occasionally doing justice because we are afraid of Orphans, Widows and the Word of God?.

###### Day 319 Religion is not just a bunch of rules

We sometimes find ourselves in a place where we have lost the true essence of our Christian life and are just trying to follow rules. Sometimes we even just go to Church so that others may think we are good. We probably have forgotten our first love for the Lord. If we feel that way then we need to renew our calling to follow Jesus.

In the Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector when they went up to the temple area to pray, the Pharisee lists out all the ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù he did for the Lord, he fasts and pays tithes and he even goes on to condemn others by saying I am not like the rest of humanity ‚Äì greedy, dishonest, adulterous or like the tax collectors. His words and actions tell us that he is self-righteous and proud, remember Pride is the deadliest sin because it tries to make us one like God.(Adam and Eve wanted to be equal with God).

We see a tax collector also come up to pray, now the tax collectors were known public sinners because they were Jews who decided to work for Rome. Tax collectors were considered traitors because their role was to extort the Jews - their own people for taxes. The taxes were so high that they put many Jews into a state of poverty. Jesus sets the tax collector as a good example as compared to the Pharisee, not because of his deeds but because of the state of his heart.

But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‚ÄòO God, be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äô
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.Luke 18:13-14

The Rich official that came to Jesus claimed that he followed all the commandments from his youth, Jesus loved him and asked him for more.
When Jesus heard this he said to him, ‚ÄúThere is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.‚Äù
But when he heard this he became quite sad, for he was very rich. Luke 18: 22-23

Our Spiritual life cannot be limited to following certain rules and doing certain good deeds. We are called to a relationship with Jesus, we are called to store up riches in heaven. We cannot separate relationship and deeds, just doing good works of charity won‚Äôt get you to heaven. Heaven does not consist of good people, but of saints. Most saints are sinners who at some point in their life discovered the call to a relationship with God and then focused only on that, all good deeds are a byproduct of being in a loving relationship with God.

‚ÄúAll saints had a past and all sinners have a future.‚Äù

The young man went away sad because he preferred to hold onto his earthly riches rather than follow Jesus.

On the contrary, we see Zacchaeus the Tax collector climb up the sycamore tree to encounter Jesus. Jesus noticed that fire in his heart to be good and even went to his house. Once anyone welcomes Jesus into their house/heart the chains are broken and one is set free.
But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúBehold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù
And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.‚Äù Luke 19: 8-10

Zaachaeus being a chief tax collector must have had to literally give away all his property because most of the money earned would have been by extortion. We see someone who was able to part with their earthly possessions to gain riches in heaven.

Jesus came for the lost and sick people in the world.

Let us not just be a rule-following, self-righteous bunch that try to work our way through goodness, but let us give it all for the sake of the Kingdom. Store up riches in heaven and more importantly listen to his voice and follow Him.
If you hear God‚Äôs call today harden not your heart.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Luke 17:7-10
It is the same in the spiritual world.
However obedient we have been to God‚Äôs Commandments, we are still sinners or humans with damaged souls (lack of sanctifying grace). Moreover, with every sin we commit, we incur an infinite debt which we can never pay back to an infinitely loving God for breaking the Covenant. Therefore we must not expect God to shower us with material gifts or prosperity in this life just because we are obeying His Commandments and doing our Christian duties.

On the other hand, if we have been successful or prosperous in life, it is not because we are obeying God‚Äôs Commandments and doing our Christian duties. We must not link the two.

This parable was initially meant for the Apostles because they were chosen to carry out God‚Äôs mission by preaching, casting out demons, performing miracles, etc. In such cases there was a chance that they could get conceited. But this parable also applies to all God‚Äôs people who are chosen to serve God in various ways. Sometimes we may secretly expect some reward for doing God‚Äôs work even though we don‚Äôt mention it. Also, more often than not, we emphasize only on our rights and not on our duties.

We have to remember always that whatever spiritual work we may be doing for the Lord, in the end He is still our Master. This parable is therefore a reminder for all disciples to be on guard against spiritual pride and to be humble at all times as a servant is expected to be.

If we have been His obedient children and if we are doing our Christian duties, then we will receive our reward in Heaven. Until then we must continue living our life in holiness and do our Christian duties faithfully without any expectations.

When we are baptized we enter into a Covenant with God. Just as an Agreement involves some kind of supply or service, in God's Kingdom the Covenant involves only Kingdom service and must continue until death.

Most of the time when we go to Church to attend the marriage supper of the Lamb we just sit and wait to be served. Jesus tells us that just because we have busied ourselves by doing work outside the Church, it should be no excuse for us to help inside the Church. When we enter the Church, God, our Master, expects us to help with some of the many works required to be done inside the Church also,.

That is kingdom work for which we must neither expect any reward on earth nor must we boast about it, because that is our obligation (1 Corinthians 9:16).

Luke 17:11-19
One leper was a Samaritan (a gentile), and the remaining nine were Jews.
When the gentile Samaritan was healed, only he came back to thank Jesus. God‚Äôs people took the miracle for granted and were not grateful for what they received.
Many of us are like the Jews. We, the people of God, receive so many blessings in our daily lives but we take them for granted as if it is God‚Äôs obligation to send us those blessings. We fail to thank God for our daily meals, our jobs, the good health we and our family enjoy, etc. We fail to obey God‚Äôs commandments when times are good, and in times of crisis we not only fail to trust in God but we even hold God responsible for the suffering we go through due to delay in ending the crisis.
Like the Samaritan, let us remember to thank God every day for all the blessings which we receive, and above all, let us always remember to thank God for giving His Son to us in the Sacraments (Confession & Communion) so that we can have divine (supernatural) life as long as we live and forever.
This incident was a type of a mini Mass.
The lepers began by saying, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have mercy on us!‚Äù
Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests.
Then one came back glorifying God.
Then the leper fell on his knees and gave thanks (Eucharistia) to Jesus.
At the end Jesus tells the man to go on his way.

Jews and Samaritans usually never got along with each other. They were enemies.
But since the same disease had struck them The two enemies were united in their misfortune.

When life is smooth, easy going, trouble-free, comfortable, we build walls between ourselves and others in the name of caste, religion, nationality, etc. But when times are bad and we are in the same boat of disaster as others, we automatically destroy the walls which we ourselves had built.
Let us be thankful to God, not only for the blessings which we have received but also for the blessings which others have received. In this way we will be able to destroy our envy and focus our attention on being charitable towards them.

Luke 17:20-21
*‚ÄúThe kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, ‚ÄòLook, here it is!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is!‚Äô For, in fact, the kingdom of God is within you.‚Äù*
Where the king is, there his kingdom is.
If Christ is in our hearts then the kingdom of God is within us. We must not look for signs but busy ourselves in sharing the Gospel and shining our light around us to glorify God.

The kingdom of God is Jesus in the Word, in Spirit and in flesh.
We have a long way to go from where we are today, until we reach the Kingdom of God in Heaven. But the Lord gives Himself to us in the Word (the Bible), in Spirit (through prayers) and in flesh (through the Sacrament) when we are in a state of grace, to give us a full assurance of our faith and the foretaste of the eternal life that awaits us. In order to reach Heaven we must receive the Kingdom of God completely and we receive all these three forms of Jesus during Mass.

When the Kingdom of God is within us completely we will be filled with the sacrificial love of Christ and we will be able to radiate that love to everyone around us (John 15:9-10).

Luke 17:26-28
In the days of Noah the priorities of humans were feasting, wealth and pleasure. They didn‚Äôt take eternal life seriously and therefore they were not prepared when the end came.

In the present time it is very clear that we are going backwards to the days of Noah and we have almost reached that stage.

In the days of Noah, those who were left behind in the Ark were saved (1 Peter 3:20) (Matthew 24:37-39).

Similarly, in the present time, those who are left behind in the Ark (the Church), will be saved. But we can be in the Ark (the Church / the Body of Christ) only if we live our Christian lives faithfully in obedience to all of God‚Äôs commandments.

Luke 17:37
*Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhere, Lord?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúWhere the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.‚Äù*
Vultures feed on dead flesh. Those who follow Christ will have divine life when Jesus comes to take His flock at the end of time (John 6:54).

Luke 18:1-8
Like the widow, sometimes we too face oppression, opposition, injustice, etc. from godless and pitiless adversaries, but in the midst of all this Jesus wants us to continue praying with persistence and not to lose hope because God will surely send justice when the time is right and deliver us from the evil and unjust people.

Jesus used a godless judge as an analogy for God because that is the way we so often view God the Father as, when we cry to Him day and night for justice and justice is delayed.

We may not say it in so many words but by the negative way we react to our problems it is obvious that we don't really trust that God is a loving Father. We therefore put our trust in finding worldly solutions to our problems because we don't have patience. We accumulate wealth and material goods because we don't trust that God will provide. But God has His own time to answer our prayers. If our prayers are not answered then it means that we are asking for something which is against God's Will. Sometimes God may want to teach us patience and trust while we wait for His answer.

Luke 18:9-14
The Pharisee‚Äôs prayer is almost a parody of the thanksgiving psalms (Psalms 30, 118). Instead of praising God for His mighty works, the Pharisee congratulates himself for his own deeds.
On the other hand, the tax collector stands at a distance, too ashamed even to raise his eyes to God (Ezra 9:6). He prays with a humble and contrite heart (Psalm 51:19). He knows that before God no one is righteous, no one has cause to boast (Roman 3:10; 4:2).

God cannot be bribed (Deuteronomy 10:17). We cannot curry favor with Him or impress Him, even with our good deeds or our faithful observance of religious duties such as tithing and fasting.
If we try to exalt ourselves before the Lord, as the Pharisee does, we will be brought low (Luke 1:52).
This should be a warning for us, not to take pride in our piety, not to slip into the self-righteousness of thinking that we are better than others, that we are ‚Äúnot like the rest of sinful humanity.‚Äù
Let us clothe ourselves with humility (1 Peter 5:5‚Äì6), and recognize that all of us are sinners in need of His mercy (Proverbs 29:33).

Luke 18:22
It is not wrong to be rich but when God blesses us with prosperity and we don‚Äôt share our blessings with the less fortunate ones then God is very displeased.

The young man had faithfully followed all of God‚Äôs commandments but he still couldn't feel the presence of God in his life because there was one commandment he had overlooked. He was blessed with a lot of wealth but he selfishly kept it for himself. He did not share it with the less fortunate ones. Therefore he had blocked God from entering his life. He wanted to surrender himself to God but he was attached to his wealth.

God gives us prosperity in life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones. Luxury and comfort are just candy coated poison.

Luke 19:1-10
By declaring that he would return what he earned by cheating, Zacchaeus was actually confessing his sin to Jesus that he had earned his wealth by using sinful methods.
In the old Covenant, the people were commanded to confess their sins to a priest with the appropriate sin offering to make the atonement (Leviticus 5 & 6) and God would forgive them their sins. But in the case of theft or damage to others, forgiveness was not complete and atonement could not be done until the person did the fitting restitution (Numbers 5:5-7).
But the old Covenant was only a shadow or preparation for the new Covenant.
Jesus therefore commended Zacchaeus for making the fitting restitution.

Before offering our gifts at the Altar during Mass, we must make restitution with the one from whom we have stolen or to whom we have caused damage in any way (Matthew 5:23-26). Thereafter we can confess our sins to the priest and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.

In cases where restitution is not possible, we must come to an agreement with the victim on how we can make satisfaction for the damage we have done.
If we are not sure how to make restitution then we can confess our sins to the priest and we will be told what we have to do. We must follow the prescribed penance obediently.

In any case, restitution or satisfaction can be done only with humans.
When we make a Covenant with Satan (commit a mortal sin) by damaging someone in any way (goods, reputation, peace, happiness, etc.), we automatically break our Covenant with God and thereby offend God severely. We can never make direct restitution with God. But, before confessing our sins, when we make restitution with the humans whom we have offended, God will be pleased with our repentance.

When Zacchaeus was robbing his fellow Jews in town, many people hated him, feared him and avoided him because many were going through financial crisis of which Zacchaeus was the cause. Thus Zacchaeus was creating ripples of badness because God was not in his heart. His heart was filled with greed.

When Zacchaeus accepted Jesus in his heart and in his home, he was suddenly so filled with love and mercy that he ended up showing mercy to all his victims in the town by returning what he had snatched from them and thus saving them from possible disasters.

Jesus showed mercy to only one man, Zacchaeus, and through Zacchaeus a whole town of miserable victims were saved. By accepting Jesus in his heart and in his home, Zacchaeus allowed Jesus to use him to create ripples of goodness.

We are all responsible for creating ripples of goodness or badness.
When we release a drop of goodness with our humility, we create ripples of goodness around us.
When we release a drop of badness with our pride, we create ripples of badness around us.
It all depends on what we choose to release.
But we can release ripples of goodness only when God is truly within us. Thus we will be able to spread love, compassion, generosity, kindness, etc. Without God we only spread anger, hatred, enmity, revenge, greed, selfishness, etc. because when God is not within us we are in the power of the devil.
*Let us therefore make a wise choice in our lives by truly surrendering ourselves to the Lord so that Jesus can use us, just as He used Zacchaeus, to create ripples of goodness around us, wherever we are. Only then we can say that God‚Äôs kingdom has come down and God‚Äôs Will is being done on earth as it is in Heaven.*

*Let God be our steering wheel and not our spare tyre.*

*The people were not happy that Jesus entered the home of a sinner and they started grumbling.*
When we invite Jesus into our lives and into our homes, the evil one will not be happy. He will therefore stir up his disciples thereby causing us to receive a lot of negative comments from people around us. But, like Zacchaeus, let us not be disturbed by people's negative comments. Let us ignore those comments, pray for those people and continue serving the Lord.

On the other hand, if God has chosen someone known to us for His divine mission, let us not be like those negative people.
Jesus came to heal those who are spiritually sick, not those who are spiritually healthy.

Luke 19:26
*Jesus said, ‚Äúto everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.*
When we are baptized, God gives each one of us some talent for the work of His Kingdom on earth (the Church).
Let us use our talents to do God's work, whether it is singing, writing, teaching, preaching, cooking, sewing, healing, etc. We can use our talents to help the poor, the sick and the aged people, or to help the Church or to help the people around us.
If we use our God-given talents to do God's work we will be blessed abundantly.
If we bury our God-given talents by using them only for earthly glory we will lose our eternal blessings.
Let us begin with baby steps and God will give us the strength to progress into walking with confidence, and growing in our mission.

Luke 19:41-44
Jesus stood there and wept because He could see the mockery and destruction of His Body (the Temple) that would happen within the next few days, which was the advance destruction and the desecration of the Temple in 70 AD. He could see the loss of life and the atrocities against the sacred. He could see the siege and fall of Jerusalem.

But Jesus was also weeping for us. He was weeping for the many times we would destroy His Temple (His Body) by living comfortably with our sins.

Luke 19:45-46
*Jesus Cleanses the Temple.*
Jesus was very soon going to celebrate the world‚Äôs greatest and first Day of Atonement and the first Passover of the new Covenant by offering His Body and Blood (physically and sacramentally) for the sins of the whole world. Therefore, the people of God, who make up the Temple of His Body, had to be in a state of grace before the Day of Atonement and the Passover.
This is the same condition for the new Covenant Temple (the Church).
The old Covenant Temple was a symbol of the Body of Christ.
The wicked vendors were symbols of sin.
If God‚Äôs people are not spiritually clean before the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), then they cannot take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) because they will bring judgement on themselves. We must therefore receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) and perform the new Day of Atonement ritual (the Penitential Rite) to purge out all the evil from our conscience so that we are in a state of grace before celebrating the new Passover and receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).

##### Peter's Denial Foretold

##### DAY 320 By Sheila

Luke 20:27-40 when faced with reality of death, there are those who do not believe in an afterlife, in a judgment and in an reckoning of Justice for all. The Sadducees, a sect in the time of Jesus, were of this confession.
So they approached Jesus, to mock Him with an absurd case, and mocked the law of marriage as well. Jesus uses their own Scriptures to show them their ignorance and their evil intent, reminding them that GOD is the God of the Living, of their ancestors, of history and of all time.
Luke 21:5-11. Jesus speaks of the Treasure Box. He observes, the poor widow dropping in two small coins. He says, it is all that she lives on. He continues, she is a true believer and worshipper of God. Even though she has been beggared by poverty, by the taxes of Rome and by her own religious leaders, she will give to God.
Jesus points out that He is in collusion with her! and He wants us to be sure that we do not put others in the position she finds herself in. And yet we are to imitate her in giving all that we have to live on.... Like Jesus who gives even His Life so that we might have life.

##### BIAY Day 320 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 20:9-19
Vineyard, in the Bible, is a metaphor for God‚Äôs people (the old Israel as well as the new).
In the Old Covenant, the ‚Äúvineyard‚Äù was ‚Äúthe Temple‚Äù / ‚Äúthe congregation of Israel,‚Äù and God was ‚Äúthe Master/Land Owner of the vineyard.‚Äù
The Temple / the congregation of Israel belonged to God.
‚ÄúThe Master‚Äôs beloved Son‚Äù is Jesus (Mark 1:11; 9:7).
The ‚ÄúTenants‚Äù were the religious leaders.
The ‚Äúservants‚Äù were ‚Äúthe prophets‚Äù whom God sent, over the centuries, to speak to the Israelites to repent and turn back to God, but the Israelites killed them.
Jesus was prophesying the fate of the religious leaders of Israel who refused to accept Him and what they would do to Him.

The duty of the religious leaders was to make their nation holy by doing God‚Äôs Will, but most of them were wicked. They offended God by failing to do His Will and they crucified and killed His Son (Jesus) outside the city gates (Mount Calvary) (v. 8).
Therefore, the priesthood of the old Covenant was destroyed in AD 70 along with the Temple building, and in the new Covenant the new priesthood was given to the new tenants (the Apostles/Bishops) (v. 9) whom Jesus ordained in the Upper Room (John 13).

The ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù are the gentiles whom the Apostles later added to the new priesthood which is now made up of mostly gentiles. The new priesthood is now universal and must continue till the end of time.
The new vineyard is now ‚Äúthe Church‚Äù (the congregation of Christians), God is still the ‚ÄúMaster / Land Owner‚Äù of the vineyard and Jesus is still the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äôs Son.‚Äù
The Church (the congregation of Christians) belongs to God.

This parable is a summary of the entire history of Israel.
God chose them, gave them a land and reminded them several times of their obligation to bear fruit. They eventually forgot that they were only the Stewards of the vineyard, not the owners.

God therefore allowed His vineyard to be overrun by foreign invaders, as Isaiah had foretold (Isaiah 5:1-7).
Jesus continued the story where Isaiah had left off.
We need to take care that we don‚Äôt let ourselves be overgrown with the thorns and briars of worldly anxiety.

Luke 20:27-40
Resurrected life is not a transfer of earthly life into Heaven. It is a life of supreme communion with God.
Marriage between man and woman is only a sign of the relation between Jesus and His bride (the Church) (Ephesians 5:23).
Just as man and woman unite to bring forth new human life, similarly, our marriage with Jesus, when we receive the Body of Christ (Communion), in a state of grace, must cause us to go forth and evangelize the world to bring souls into the Church.

Luke 21:2-4
Our giving has more value when we share the little we have because it is more difficult to give from our poverty than it is to share from our abundance.

Luke 21:25-28
This prophecy is associated with Zechariah 14:4 (the day of the Lord) which says that the Messiah would come when the end is near.
The purpose of this chapter is to prepare the Church for a period of distress, trials and persecutions before the second coming of Christ. The proper Christian attitude should be not to panic or to be alarmed, but to persevere in faith till the end.

Jesus was speaking of two destructions: the Temple and the city.
The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe. The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.
Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city. It was a Temple with a city around it, and it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).
Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city. It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it. The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally (because the Church has parishes all over the world).

Luke 21:34-38
Let us not get carried away with feasting and drinking and the anxieties of daily life, or the end will catch us by surprise like a trap.

Luke 22:3-6
Judas was chosen so that he could forget his past habits and become a faithful disciple of Christ. But somewhere in between Judas lost his focus on discipleship and focused more on the world. By choosing to betray Jesus he was committing a mortal sin and therefore had a tragic end.

We are baptized into Jesus to be His disciples by living holy lives and to evangelize the world by sharing the Word of God. But, like Judas, when we focus more on the pleasures and comforts of this world and lose our focus on our discipleship then, like Judas, we too are betraying Jesus and our soul may meet with a tragic end.

The chief priests bribed Judas to betray Jesus and Judas accepted the bribe to do the unlawful act of selling Jesus.
The chief priests represent those Christians who bribe others to get work done illegally, and Judas represents those Christians who accept or ask for bribes to proceed with work against the law.

Whenever we (Christians) get involved with accepting bribes, like Judas, we too are standing on Calvary and selling Jesus to the devil to be scourged and crucified.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with giving bribes to do something unlawful, like the chief priests, we are guilty of scourging and crucifying Jesus.

Whether we give bribes or take bribes or whether we are the middle person in a bribe, in all three cases we commit a sin. If we are guilty of being involved in a bribe in any way, we must return the bribe or give away what we received illegally and confess our sin without delay.

Luke 22:19-20
The old Covenant was always re-established only after a sacrifice was offered:
by Noah (Genesis 8:20), by Abraham, by Isaac, by Jacob, by Moses, and by David.
Similarly, the new Covenant was also established only after Jesus offered the sacramental sacrifice in the Upper Room.

Receiving absolution, after sins are forgiven, is the initial stage of Covenant renewal.
Covenant renewal is complete only after a sacrifice is offered in atonement for breaking it with our sins.

*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

*This is my body ...........This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

When God speaks, His Word does not return empty. His words accomplish what is spoken (Isaiah 55:11; Genesis 1:3).
Therefore, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" the bread and wine became His mystical Body and Blood.

In the old Covenant, the earthly lamb was a symbol and it died after it was slaughtered, therefore it did not have the power to give the people eternal life when they received it.

In the new Covenant, by His life, death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus put the power of the Holy Spirit in the heavenly Lamb (of God) (Communion) therefore this Lamb can give us eternal life when we receive Him in a state of grace because this Lamb is still living even though He died after He was slaughtered.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice. Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real. Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired. By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

Jesus made advance atonement for us by offering His physical Body and Blood on the Cross, once for all, so that He could give His priests His sacramental Body and Blood to make regular atonement for the sins of their congregation because without the shedding of (holy) blood there is no remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22).
Therefore He consecrated the bread and wine in the Upper Room and commanded His priests to repeat the same action as long as they lived. Whenever the priests consecrate the bread and wine, Jesus transforms them into His Body and Blood and offers them to God the Father in atonement for the sins of the priest and his congregation.

Although we can do penance, for hurting God with our sins, by making sacrifices in many different ways, the only sacrifice acceptable to God, in atonement for sins, is the sacrificed Body and Blood of His Son.
The first and bloody day of the old Passover was a shadow of the physical sacrifice of the Lamb of God (Jesus), and the following 7 days of feast of the unleavened bread were shadows of His sacramental sacrifice which Jesus commanded His priests to offer during Mass, the unleavened bread being a shadow of His sinless Body.
The Apostles continued doing the same as long as they lived (Acts 2:46-47) and it is the obligation of every priest to do the same as long as they live.

Mary (the new Eve) is the Ark of the Covenant and the Blood of the Covenant is the same Blood which Jesus received from His Mother and which He offered to God in atonement for our sins, to reverse the error of the first Eve.

Luke 22:25-26
*But he said to them, ‚ÄúThe kings of the gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves.*

In the pagan world the person with authority bosses over the subordinates but in God's kingdom the person with authority must serve the subordinates.
An apostle's / bishop's duty is to serve the congregation, specially during the distribution of the sacrificial meal.

##### Day 320 Peter‚Äôs denial

Let‚Äôs try to remember the last time we went to confession, we probably came out with great vigor to never commit those sins again. Or after a retreat, we come back with great zeal to tell everyone about Jesus. Likewise Peter was so full of zeal to even die for Jesus.

‚ÄúSimon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,
32but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.‚Äù
33He said to him, ‚ÄúLord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.‚Äù
34But he replied, ‚ÄúI tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.‚Äù Luke 22:31-34

However Jesus knows everything about us, He foretold Peter‚Äôs denial. Jesus knew that it was going to be a time of great trial for the disciples ‚Äì for Jesus said ‚ÄúSatan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat‚Äù.

After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.
55They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.
56When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, ‚ÄúThis man too was with him.‚Äù
57But he denied it saying, ‚ÄúWoman, I do not know him.‚Äù
58A short while later someone else saw him and said, ‚ÄúYou too are one of them‚Äù; but Peter answered, ‚ÄúMy friend, I am not.‚Äù
59About an hour later, still another insisted, ‚ÄúAssuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.‚Äù
60But Peter said, ‚ÄúMy friend, I do not know what you are talking about.‚Äù Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,
61and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‚ÄúBefore the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.‚Äù
62He went out and began to weep bitterly. Luke 22:54-62

Peter who promised to go to prison or even die for Jesus, is outright denying that he even knew Jesus. Peter is human and was probably afraid for his life. Imagine how sad, upset and contrite Peter must have felt as soon as Jesus looked at him when the cock crowed thrice.
Are we not like Peter, initially full of zeal, and when it comes to it, we back out and deny Jesus. The one thing that Peter did better than Judas is he repented, he felt sorry for his sins and knew the heart of Jesus. He knew that God‚Äôs love and mercy is without bounds. Jesus knows our hearts too, that we are human and will waiver in our intentions. God still loves us, no matter how bad we are or how many times we have failed. His Mercy is never-ending.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Jesus' Prayer in the Garden

[![Jesus' Prayer in the Garden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day321.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DeOqtYjaUUE "Jesus' Prayer in the Garden")

##### Day 321 Where not our heart burning when He spoke to us

Oh how I wished I was Cleopas, he and his wife on the road to Emmaus had the pleasure of a long conversation with the risen Lord. Jesus probably did like a ‚ÄúBible in a year - in a day‚Äù reading the Old Testament and explaining how Jesus is the fulfillment of the old testament promises, how Jesus is the new Adam, Moses, David, Elijah‚Ä¶. I cannot even imagine how uplifted and overwhelmed they must have felt, given how downcast they were feeling after Jesus' death.

Then they said to each other, ‚ÄúWere not our hearts burning \[within us\] while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us?‚Äù Luke 24:32

At the end of the journey when they years where opened by Jesus teaching and their hearts on fire, Jesus did something that would blow their socks off ‚Äì he celebrated the Eucharist with them.

And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them.
31With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. Luke 24:31

In the breaking of the bread, Jesus revealed His true presence and divinity. After they ate this bread their eyes were opened, and they ate the fruit of the new tree of life the cross. Our first parents ate the forbidden fruit and their eyes were closed. We should not be too jealous of Cleopas and his wife as we still have the Eucharist even till this day 2000+ years later. In the Eucharist, the scriptures are read, and they are opened up to us by the priest/deacon. And in the breaking of the bread Jesus‚Äôs true presence is felt. ‚ÄúThis is my body and this is my blood‚Äù When we eat this bread our eyes are opened and we receive life, we receive nourishment, and strength for the journey to heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Luke 22:39-46
In the 21st century we may try to look at this scene from a medical point of view, trying to figure out the scientific explanation of a human sweating blood. But when a first century Jew heard this account, his thoughts would have gone back to the beginning of creation when man was cursed to earn his living by the sweat of his brow, and the ground was cursed along with the man (Genesis 3:17-19). Therefore, with the drops of the precious Blood of Jesus falling on the cursed ground, Jesus reversed or undid the ancient curse of the fall of man, and the ground was therefore blessed once again.

Jesus allowed Himself to be crushed with pain and sorrow, starting in the Garden of Olives and ending on the new Tree of Life (the Cross) so that His grace could flow through the new Olive oil for spiritual healing and salvation of the whole world.

Luke 22:47-53
A while ago Jesus was sweating drops of blood but after uniting His Will to God's Will He was calm and totally in control of the situation even though He knew that it was the beginning of His passion.

When we surrender ourselves to God we will not be disturbed by any calamity which the devil will try to create around us, even if we have to die, because God will be with us.

Luke 22:61-62
Simon Peter's repentance was godly repentance because after he denied Jesus he looked at Jesus and then he cried bitterly (Matt. 26:75). He was truly sorry for what he had done to Jesus.

Judas's repentance was worldly repentance because after he betrayed Jesus he looked at his coins and hanged himself (Matt. 27:3-5). He did not look at Jesus.

Luke 23:6-12
Pilate had more power over the whole of Israel whereas even though Herod's power was limited only to Galilee, Herod didn't have the power to execute a criminal who was guilty of treason. Herod was probably angry with Pilate because Pilate had earlier killed some Galileans without consulting him (Luke 13:1). Therefore, to please Herod this time Pilate sent Jesus to Herod to confirm if Jesus was guilty. Thereafter Pilate and Herod became friends because they had a common enemy (Psalm 2:2).

Luke 23:8-11
Herod was intrigued when he had earlier heard the preaching of John (the Baptist), and when he heard that Jesus was not only gathering crowds with His preaching but also performing miracles, Herod tried to see Jesus (Luke 9: 7-9) but he could not because his popularity with his people was more important for him than seeing Jesus.

Herod finally got a chance to see Jesus when Jesus came to him (v. 23:8) but Herod was not interested in listening to the Word of God or helping the innocent prisoner. He was hoping that Jesus would entertain him with some magical signs and eventually sent Jesus away after mocking Him (v. 23:11).
What a great opportunity Herod missed. He wanted to see Jesus so the Son of God came to him, as a prisoner, but Herod mocked Him and sent Him away because he had other priorities on his mind.

Let us not follow Herod's path. When Jesus comes to us in the form of a prisoner or even a poor, lame, mute, blind, old or sick person, let us not send Him away with mockery or look at Him as an entertainer. Let us not ignore or push Jesus away by giving importance to our earthly priorities or trying to please humans.
Let us soften our hearts and please the Lord by helping the less fortunate ones.

Luke 23:39-41
*One of the rebels who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, ‚ÄúAre you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!‚Äù*
Like most of us, the bad rebel was using Jesus as a vending machine, expecting miracles for material gain.

*But the other rebuked him, saying, ‚ÄúDo you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.‚Äù*
This man, although he was a sinner, was more interested in his eternal life.
He believed that the man hanging on the Cross was Jesus, the King, and an innocent man. This means that at some point in the previous 3 years, before he went astray, he had followed Jesus, even if it was for a short while.

Sometimes we too are like him. We start following Jesus seriously when we have problems; after our problems are solved we continue for a while, then we start getting bored with Jesus and we turn back to our previous lifestyle and end up in deep trouble that wakes us up from our spiritual slumber.

Luke 24:30-32
In the Garden of Eden, when Adam & Eve ate the forbidden fruit, their eyes were opened and they saw their nakedness ("nahash" in Hebrew), because they saw the Word of God through the eyes of Satan ("nahash" in Hebrew).

In Emmaus, when the disciples ate the consecrated bread (the mystical Body of the risen Christ / the Holy Eucharist), their eyes were opened and they saw Jesus through the eyes of faith, even though Jesus had vanished, because they saw the Word of God through the eyes of God (Jesus).

When we see the Word of God through the eyes of God, our eyes will be opened and we will see Jesus in the Bread of life through the eyes of faith, even though we cannot see Jesus with our physical eyes.

We will, however, be able to see the risen Christ in Heaven some day if, during our lifetime, the Word of God abides in us and we receive the Bread of life (the Holy Eucharist) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).

Luke 24:27 & 30-32
Jesus explained to the disciples how to connect the scriptures (Old Testament) with Him; how to look for shadows in the scriptures which point to Him. Although the Jews were very thorough with the scriptures, it is doubtful that they ever understood the meaning of the scriptures, which is the reason why they were blank until Jesus explained to them how to find the shadows in the scriptures and connect them to the reality in the new Covenant. The Old Covenant people would never have imagined how God was going to transform the Passover of the Old Covenant, which was not renewable, into the glorious Passover the New Covenant, which is now renewable.

What is remarkable is the effect it had on those disciples. The reading of the scriptures caused the hearts of the disciples to burn and the breaking of the bread opened their eyes.
After the resurrection, Jesus celebrated the first Mass with the liturgy of the Word (Luke 24:27) and the liturgy of the Eucharist (Luke 24:30-32).
This is how Jesus wants us to celebrate the Mass in Church.

On the road to Emmaus, when the disciples heard the Word of God (Scriptures) it caused their hearts to burn, and in the breaking of the bread (Communion) their eyes were opened.

May we too have the same experience during every Mass on the road of our life till we reach our Emmaus (Heaven) to have supreme communion with the Lord.

After the disciples heard the Word of God Jesus did not go to their home un-invited, nor did He ask them if He can stay. Jesus waited till they invited Him into their home.

Similarly, after we hear the Word of God (Gospel & Readings) Jesus waits for us to invite Him into our hearts. We must therefore ask Jesus to stay with us so that we can have supper (Communion) with Him.

The liturgy of the Word during Mass must cause our hearts also to burn and the liturgy of the Eucharist must open our eyes because Christianity is a religion of the Word and the Word is Christ present in the scriptures as well as the Eucharist. We cannot have one without the other. Both must go together.

Thus, by giving Himself to us through the scriptures and then in the Eucharist, Christ does for us during Mass what He did for those disciples in Emmaus. And like those disciples, Jesus wants us to recognize Him through the Eucharist and believe Him.
But this is not something we can achieve on our own. We need some help (John 16:12-14), and this help we receive from the Holy Spirit.

##### Day 322 Restore God‚Äôs Kingdom on earth

After Jesus' crucifixion, death, and resurrection Jesus presented Himself many times to the apostles with many proofs. If this was not true, I‚Äôm sure none of them would have given up their lives for Jesus.

He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.Acts 1:3

Jesus was preparing the apostles for the biggest mission of their life to go out to the ends of the earth and preach the good news and build up the church. In order for them to be able to do this, Jesus asked them to stay and pray.

While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for ‚Äúthe promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak. for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4

Now Jesus was with them a long time ‚Äì 40 days and they must have been getting impatient so they asked him ‚ÄúLord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?‚Äù
But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.‚Äù
9When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. Acts 1: 8-9

After Jesus gave them these final instructions He Ascended into heaven. After Jesus Ascended to Heaven, the disciples dedicated their time to prayer, they stayed together in the upper room and prayed. They must have been really scared as the Romans killed their leader and could kill any of them as well. They thought Jesus would restore the kingdom by defeating the Roman Empire, however, that did not happen. Now Jesus even entrusted this big task to the disciples and they probably had big doubts in their mind. They probably had no clue about how the Holy Spirit would empower them and how they would be Jesus‚Äô witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

But they just stuck together and prayed, waiting for the Holy Spirit to empower them.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 322 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 1:6-8
The Apostles asked Jesus ‚Äúwhen‚Äù the Kingdom will be restored, and Jesus responded by telling them ‚Äúhow‚Äù the Kingdom will be restored.
The Kingdom of God, which was destroyed in the Garden of Eden, will be restored by beginning with evangelisation.

The physical Body of Christ was present in limited space and time in the first century in Israel but the ascended mystical Body of Christ can be present in multiple places at the same time and His Body includes all His flock.
The disciples wanted to know when the good times would come when they would be freed from their enemies and they would see peace in their land.
Like the disciples, sometimes we too ask the same question because we want to be free from our trouble-making enemy (Satan) and enjoy peace in our lives.
But Jesus reminds us that our duty is not to focus on the turmoil or things of this world. Our duty is to get busy and start evangelizing the world so that Jesus can use us to bring maximum people into His Kingdom and thus bring peace in our lives.

The Kingdom of God would start in Israel but would not be limited to the territory of Israel. It would spread out to the whole world.
It would be an invisible kingdom made up of invisible souls.

Romans 1:3
Jesus is the Son of God, descended from David according to the flesh.
Jesus redeemed the world by offering His flesh and blood in atonement for our sins, the same flesh and blood which He received from his Mother Mary.

In the Old Covenant, every first born male was pre-destined by his first born status to serve as a common priest, by offering the daily sacrifices to God, and protecting His family from evil, even to the point of death.

Jesus, the first born of Mary by flesh, has fulfilled His duty as our older brother, by becoming the sacrificial priest and protecting His siblings from the enemy (Satan). Therefore, through baptism all Christians, who obey God‚Äôs commandments, become the second born of Mary (Revelation 12:17) and thus belong to God's family.
If Jesus is our older brother then Mary is our Mother, and that is why Jesus gave her to us (His beloved disciples) (John 19:26-27).

If Jesus is our Bridegroom then, by the law, Mary is still our Mother.
In the earthly Davidic kingdom, as the son of Joseph, Jesus was the rightful heir to the earthly throne after the death of Joseph. Therefore, by the law, Mary was the rightful Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Likewise, in the heavenly Davidic kingdom, since Jesus is our King, Mary becomes our rightful heavenly Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Romans 1:1-7
Paul applies the term ‚Äúslave‚Äù to himself in order to express his undivided allegiance to the Lord of the Church, the Master of all including slaves and masters because ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters‚Äù faithfully (Matthew 6:24).

A first century slave was a servant who obeyed the master's instructions 100 % without any argument or excuses.
A slave did not have the right to pick and choose which instructions of his master he would obey. He either had to obey the instructions 100% or he had to undergo severe punishment.
A slave did not have the right to voice his/her opinion or suggestion.

It is this aspect of the slave-master relationship, rather than its degrading implications, that Paul emphasizes when he discusses Christian commitment.

Paul wants us to obey God like a slave obeys his master because God knows what is best for us, better than we do, whereas our sinful nature always craves for worldly things to satisfy the desires of our flesh.
According to Paul, faith and fidelity go together. They are inseparable.

Romans 1:7
*Called to be holy.*
Paul often refers to Christians as ‚Äúthe holy ones‚Äù or ‚Äúthe saints.‚Äù
The Israelite community was called a ‚Äúholy assembly‚Äù because they had been separated for the worship and service of the Lord (Leviticus 11:44; 23:1‚Äì44).
The Christian community regarded its members as sanctified by baptism (Romans 6:22; 15:16; 1 Corinthians 6:11; Ephesians 5:26‚Äì27). All Christians are called to holiness (1 Corinthians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:7), that is, they are called to make their lives conform to the gift of baptism which they have already received.

##### Pentecost

[![Pentecost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day323.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LtoUrd0t1Rs "Pentecost")

##### Day 323 The Baptism in the Spirit

As we read about the coming of the Holy Spirit in an emporing way on Pentecost we cannot help by feel ‚ÄúI want to receive the Holy Spirit like that‚Äù. The truth is that we all have been Baptised in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and we have received a outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Baptism. At Confirmation we also receive the Holy Spirit when the Bishop lays his hands on us and anoints our head with the Chrism oil. So why don‚Äôt we have an experience like the experience of the Apostles at Pentecost. The answer is some do and some don‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThe Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak‚Äù Mt 26:41

Some folks are prepared for confirmation and some are not, some are expecting the received power from on high and some are not. The truth is that we have already received the Holy Spirit at Baptism and at every sacrament however we are not open to the Spirit.
The Baptism in the Spirit is a spiritual opening of oneself to the working of the Holy Spirit. It involes knowing the love of God, knowing our own weakness and sins, repentance and being prayed over for the Holy Spirit. The process described above is also popularly knows in Catholic Charismatic circles as ‚ÄúLife in the Spirit seminars - LSS‚Äù.

Just like on Pentecost after the apostles where filled with the Holy Spirit, they came out and proclaimed God‚Äôs message of salvation. We also need to hear it, repent, concisionly allow the Holy Spirit to lead us.
This will cause use to be filled with the Holy Spirit and we will inturn proclaim God‚Äôs word to the world.

What comes after the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is more important, that is living a active Christian life.

They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the communal life, to the breaking of the bread and to the prayers

Awe came upon everyone, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.

All who believed were together and had all things in common

Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple area and to breaking bread in their homes. They ate their meals with exultation and sincerity of heart,
47praising God and enjoying favor with all the people. And every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. Acts 2: 42-47

Thet devoted themselves to the 4 pillars of Christian community life.
Teaching of the apostles
Communal life(Fellowship)
Breaking of the break(Eucharist)
Prayers

If we ask why our parish is struggling or why our personal spirutal state is bad. We are probably missing some of the pillars of Christian community life. Most people are only trying to survive with one Mass on Sunday, I‚Äôm sorry to say this may not take you too far, you cannot say you love someone and not spend time with them. We need to study the Word and the church teachings, we need to have a place we belong, we need to attend Mass(it‚Äôs mentioned daily breaking of the bread) we also need to dedicated our lives to prayer, praying always.
Praying in the Spirit always.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Acts 2:1-3
*When the time came for Pentecost, all the believers were gathered together in one place. Suddenly a noise came from the sky like a strong wind blowing, and it filled the entire house in which they were all sitting. Then they saw what looked like tongues of fire, which spread out and came to rest on each one of them.*

The Spirit is the life-giving breath of the Father, the Wisdom by which He made all things (Psalm 104:24).
In the first creation, the Spirit came as a ‚Äúmighty wind‚Äù sweeping over the face of the earth (Genesis 1:2).
In the new creation of Pentecost, the same Spirit again came as ‚Äúa strong, driving wind‚Äù to renew the face of the earth (Psalm 104:30).
We receive that same Spirit in the sacraments, being made a ‚Äúnew creation‚Äù in Baptism (2 Corinthians 5:17) and we drink of the same Spirit during Mass, in the Eucharist (1 Corinthians 12:12-13).

The fire which came down from Heaven and consumed the sacrifices on Solomon‚Äôs Altar was the same fire which came down from Heaven and rested on the believers in the Upper Room. It was the flame of the Holy Spirit.

After the sacrifice, when Isaac returned to his home, his father (Abraham) sent his Helper (Eliezer) to his home town with several gifts, to find a bride for his son. When Isaac saw her (Rebecca) he loved her and took her into his mother's tent (Genesis 24:1-67).

This was a fore shadow of the New Covenant.

After the sacrifice, when Jesus returned to his home (Heaven), God the Father sent his Helper (the Holy spirit) to his home town (Jerusalem) on Pentecost Sunday, with several gifts (love, peace, joy, kindness, etc.) to find a bride (the Church) for his Son, and the Mother of Jesus was there. Jesus loves his bride (the Church) very much.

The descent of the Holy Spirit on Mary conceived the physical Body of Christ (Luke 1:35).
The descent of the Holy Spirit on the believers, on Pentecost Sunday, conceived the mystical Body of Christ (the Church). It is no wonder that the mother of Jesus was also among the people in the Upper Room.

Likewise, every time a person is baptized, the Holy Spirit forms mini Christs through Mary. These mini Christs together become part of the Body of Christ but they are not yet fully formed ‚Äúin Christ.‚Äù After baptism we still have to grow *in Christ*.

The Holy Spirit is given to us to empower us to go out and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20).
The Sacrament of Confirmation perpetuates the grace of Pentecost.

Pentecost was the reversal of what happened at Babel.
At Babel, the people spoke 70 different languages and were scattered into 70 nations over all the earth (Genesis 11:1-9).

At Jerusalem, on Pentecost Sunday, the people spoke different languages but they were united in Christ. Israel's mission was to minister to all the 70 nations.
On Pentecost Sunday love united what discord had scattered.

Pentecost Sunday was also the reversal of Mount Sinai.
At Mount Sinai 3000 idolaters were killed (Exodus 32:27-28).
At Pentecost 3000 were baptized and thus received new life (Acts 2:41).

Pentecost Sunday was the fulfillment of Mount Sinai.
In the old Covenant, at Mount Sinai, the Spirit of God descended on the mountain with peals of thunder and in the form of fire (Exodus 19:18) and God‚Äôs people (the Israelites) received the first Law on tablets of stone.

In the new Covenant, on Pentecost Sunday, the Spirit of God descended on the people on the mountain with loud noise and in tongues of fire to make known His presence in a visible, powerful and supernatural way and God‚Äôs people (the believers) received the new Law (the Gospel of love) written on their hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit received through the sacrament (2 Corinthians 3:2‚Äì8; Romans 8:2), on the 50th day after the new Passover (Easter Sunday).

Acts 2:42
*They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread.*

The believers devoted themselves to the breaking of bread because they understood and believed that during the liturgical service (the Mass) Jesus transforms the bread and wine into His mystical Body and Blood (Luke 24:30-31).

They also understood and believed that, from Pentecost Sunday onwards, the Body and Blood of the Lamb of God had to be offered during the liturgical services instead of the body and blood of the earthly lambs.

‚ÄúPentecosta‚Äù in Greek means ‚Äúfiftieth‚Äù.
In the Old Covenant, the *Festival of Weeks* or *Pentecosta* was celebrated with joy on the 50th day from the day of the *feast of the first fruits* of the wheat/barley harvest (Leviticus 23:15-16).

In the New Covenant, Pentecost was the fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks and is celebrated on the 50th day after Easter Sunday (or Resurrection Day), Jesus being the first fruit of the new harvest.

The ‚ÄúFestival of Weeks‚Äù of the old Covenant was a mandatory festival and all Jews had to celebrate the festival by attending the liturgical service only in the Jerusalem Temple to celebrate their birth as God‚Äôs chosen people in the Covenant Law given to Moses at Sinai. It was thus designed by God to prepare the situation for Pentecost of the new Covenant, so that, fourteen hundred years later, Jews from all over the world, speaking different languages, would be gathered in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost to receive the Holy Spirit through Baptism. The newly baptized Jewish Christians would now need a Church to worship God in their respective foreign countries of residence, so the Apostles were compelled to spread out all over the world, anointing men for the priesthood to serve God‚Äôs people. And thus the Gospel spread to the whole world through the Jewish Christians (the Apostles), just as God had desired (Exodus 19:6).

Acts 2:15-36
By his first sermon on Pentecost Sunday, Peter opened the door of the kingdom of Heaven for the first time with the spiritual keys given to him by Jesus (Matthew 16:19) and started God's new family in Heaven by baptizing 3,000 people on the first day (Acts 2:41).

Romans 2:5-8
When we are baptized into Christ, we must continue to do good works in Christ so that Jesus can carry out His Kingdom work through us and so that His light may shine though us (Matthew 5:16).
If we say we have faith in Jesus then we must prove it with our ‚Äúgood works.‚Äù

The purpose of doing good works is not to earn merits. Good works play an important role in the salvation of the world. We must do good works so that on seeing our good works the non-Christians may glorify God and be drawn towards Christ so that Jesus can bring them into His Kingdom / His Body (the Church). Good works are the visible means of bringing people into God's Kingdom. We must therefore continue doing good works for Christ even in the midst of crisis or problems in our lives, trusting that God will take care of our souls in the event of sudden death.

We will therefore be judged according to our faith and works (Galatians 6:7-9; Matthew 5:36-37; Matthew 25:34-46; (James 2:24); etc.). If there are no good works to be found in us, then we will have deprived many souls of salvation.

Romans 2:15
*They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness; and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them.*
Paul was speaking of the (Moral) Law of Christ: ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù (Galatians 5:14).
We are reminded of our guilt when our thoughts accuse us, thus enabling us to repent, but when we force our thoughts to excuse us then there is no feeling of guilt and we ultimately end up with a large pile of mortal sins.

Romans 3:28
*For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law.*
The works prescribed by the Mosaic law were not effective enough to purify a person's soul. The Mosaic law was meant to civilize a world of uncivilized people till they were sober enough to be able to receive the Body of Christ in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Romans 3:31
*Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.*
The Mosaic law was not meant to be discarded. It was meant to be upgraded and fulfilled by Jesus (Matthew 5:17).
Through the Sermon on the mount and the parables and by the way He lived His life, Jesus upgraded the Moral law (eg. Eye for an eye = give the other cheek).
By His passion, death, resurrection and Ascension, Jesus fulfilled the Religious law.

##### Day 324 Saved by grace

One of the big debates that Catholics and some protestants have is Are you saved by faith alone? The Catholic church does not believe we are saved by faith alone, although faith is necessary to be saved. Saved by Faith ‚Äúalone‚Äù is not found in the Bible.
We see Paul explaining how Abraham was not saved by circumcision but by his faith, he was justified, and he was not justified by the works he did. So let‚Äôs get it clear we cannot be saved by faith alone or by works alone. We are saved by grace, the grace that comes from the life death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
We do need faith to believe that we are saved, we also need to have works to prove that we truly have faith, for actions are a result of what we believe. But it‚Äôs not our effort not our faith alone or our works alone that justify us, it‚Äôs the blood of Christ that justifies us.

Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace\* with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have gained access \[by faith\] to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1,2

We gain access to grace through faith, so faith is needed but is not the end, its not faith alone. It‚Äôs like flying a kite, we use some effort to get but we cannot sustain it forever, we need the wind(grace) to come and fly it. Like this example we need to believe and have faith but faith alone gets us into grace by which we are saved.
We should count our afflictions and trials as a blessing as, it produces endurance, endurance produces character, proven character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. So sufferings produces love and God is love.

Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance,
4and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope
5and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us. Romans 5: 4-5

We can be assured of God‚Äôs love for us and his saving mercy because he died for us while we were still sinners. We still have a choice to just leave Christ and ignore the price He paid for us on the cross. But he still loves us.
But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

9How much more then, since we are now justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath.
10Indeed, if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, once reconciled, will we be saved by his life. Rom 5: 8-10

We can rest assured of heaven if we have faith, and our faith produces works, but both our faith and works are not enough we need to be saved and Jesus saved us, while we were still sinners He died for us. We are washed by his blood and are redeemed, when we were sinners Jesus died for us how much more now that we are reconciled and are friends of God, we are trying to live a good Christian life, I‚Äôm sure we will be saved by God, by his grace and mercy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Romans 4:16
Paul referred to Abraham as "our father in faith," not because Abraham started out with deep faith at his first encounter with God, but because over the passage of time (25 years) Abraham‚Äôs faith in God became strong by journeying with God.
Abraham is the first person in the Bible to be described as a prophet (Genesis 20:7) and this is a reminder for us that God‚Äôs prophets and leaders are often far from perfect. While the Lord delights in using imperfect instruments like us, He‚Äôs never content to stop at our brokenness. He always has bigger plans for us than we have for ourselves; and He longs to bring us on a journey of ever-deepening trust, just as He did thousands of years ago with Abraham, our father in faith.

Romans 5:12
*Sin came into the world through one man.*

Adam was the head of the family and a type/symbol of Christ and Eve was a type/symbol of the Church.
Adam was supposed to protect his bride from evil just as Jesus saves His bride (the Church / the Christians) from evil (Ephesians 5:23-27). Adam had the ultimate authority and therefore, like Jesus (Luke 4:3-12), he should have made the decision to reject Satan‚Äôs offer. His decision was the final and definitive decision, not only for his family, but, for the entire human family. It was a lofty position given to him by God. That is why they knew they were naked only after Adam ate the fruit (Genesis 3:7).

When the Adam (man) of the family does not obey God‚Äôs commandments, does not gather his family for daily prayers, does not help his family to stay out of mortal sin, does not ensure that his family attends Mass every Sunday, and supports his bride‚Äôs evil deeds instead of correcting her, then he is inviting the devil into his domestic Eden (home). Like the first Eve, his bride too will eventually fall into temptation (gossiping, quarrelling, disrespecting others, etc.) and gradually the entire family will start walking on the wrong path.

Romans 5:13
*‚Ä¶.. for up to the time of the law, sin was in the world, though sin is not accounted when there is no law.*

Before the Law was given, through Moses, sin did exist in the world but the wicked ones could not be held guilty because God had not yet given His law to the people. Therefore, people followed the natural law and did what they felt was right.

Before the incarnation of Jesus the power of evil was greater than the power of good because Adam and Eve have given damaged souls (without divine life) to all humanity, and therefore majority of the old Covenant people followed the natural law because they found it difficult to lead good lives in the midst of evil.
But from the time of the incarnation, when God touched the earth (the womb of Mary), the world has been divinized and we are able to be peaceful. When we are baptized we receive the grace and peace of Christ which helps the people of goodwill to move towards God.

Romans 5:15-16
*And the free gift is not like the result of the one person‚Äôs sin. For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation; but the gift, after many sins, brought acquittal.*
The sin of one man (Adam) destroyed his divine life and thereby damaged his soul and brought physical and eternal death (Hell). The consequence of Adam‚Äôs sin spread to all humanity like a contagious disease. Therefore, except Jesus and His mother, all humans are born with damaged souls (without divine life), by default, and are therefore subject to physical and eternal death.
But the gift of eternal life which we receive through the redemption of one man (Jesus) does not spread to humanity as Adam‚Äôs sin did.

We can receive eternal life if we have divine life within us (John 6:54) which is possible only after we enter the Church with faith in Christ, followed by baptism. Thereafter we must receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly, with faith, follow all the teachings of Christ and obey all God‚Äôs commandments as well as the Law of the Church.

Romans 5:20
*Where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more.*
We tortured the divine Son of God and killed Him because of our sinful nature but Jesus offered the same tortured flesh and dripping Blood to God to save us because He loved us.
On Good Friday, Jesus transformed the greatest evil in human history into the greatest good for all humanity.

God permits evil in order to draw forth some greater good.

The Mosaic law did not have the power to change hearts. Our hearts can be changed towards God only through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Mosaic Law was powerful enough to teach but it wasn't powerful enough to save.

Sin comes to us naturally; we struggle to maintain holiness.

The old law could not give the people the power to keep the law. It could only point out sin. Thus, it increased sin because it made clear what constituted sin. But, through the sacraments, Jesus gives us the grace to maintain holiness and to be able to live the new law.

There is nothing to prevent human nature being raised up to something greater, even after sin.
Whenever we encounter evil, God will give us the grace to overcome it, if we live in obedience to God's commandments and remain in a state of grace at all times.

##### Boldness in Faith

[![Boldness in Faith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day325.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kl5Z78h3bNk "Boldness in Faith")

##### Day 325 Boldness to proclaim

We can so vividly remember Peter‚Äôs denial. The same person who was even afraid to acknowledge he knew Jesus, is not going to prison for Jesus and does not even care about his life. He accuses the leaders, elders, and scribes of failing to recognize the Messiah. ‚ÄúIf God is for you no one can be against you‚Äù ‚Äì nothing can be done to stop Peter and his companions. Peter and the apostles were not afraid of anything, they knew they were doing God‚Äôs will and nothing was going to stop them not even death.

‚ÄúWhether it is right in the sight of God for us to obey you rather than God, you be the judges.
20It is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.‚Äù Acts 4:19
The warning did not deter Peter and the rest of the early Christian community, this in turn caused them to pray for more boldness to proclaim the good news of the Gospel.
And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and enable your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
30as you stretch forth \[your\] hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.‚Äù
31 As they prayed, the place where they were gathered shook, and they were all filled with the holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:29-31
Let us also be inspired by the early Christian community, so we are able to pray for boldness and proclaim the good news with great conviction and authority.

St Paul‚Äôs letter to the Romans is really beautiful and helps us understand the salvation economics better. We learnt in yesterdays readings that we are not saved by our faith or works alone. We are saved by grace, by Jesus life death and resurrection.
The law entered in so that transgression might increase but, where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more,
21so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What then shall we say? Shall we persist in sin that grace may abound? Of course not!
2How can we who died to sin yet live in it?
Rom 8:5:20-2, 6:1,2
Just because we are saved by grace that does not mean we can continue to sin and let grace do its job. Even though grace overflows when sin increases, that does not mean we can continue to commit sin and expect to be saved. If we do that we can be certain that we won't be saved, because sinning is being united to death. We are to put to death the old self, crucified with Christ. Our sinful body might be done away with that we might no longer be slaves to sin.
If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him‚Äù Rom 6:8
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as \[being\] dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus. Rom 6:11
We need to try our best to fight against the old self in us and to live a new life.
However everyone can attest that as hard as we try we end up committing sin. This was exactly what St Paul was experiencing.

What I do, I do not understand. For I do not do what I want, but I do what I hate.
16Now if I do what I do not want, I concur that the law is good.
17So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
18For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. The willing is ready at hand, but doing the good is not.
19For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.
20Now if \[I\] do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
21So, then, I discover the principle that when I want to do right, evil is at hand.
22For I take delight in the law of God, in my inner self,
23 but I see in my members another principle at war with the law of my mind, taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
24Miserable one that I am! Who will deliver me from this mortal body?
25Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom 7: 15-25

We will struggle with sin and wrestle the old man in our all our lives, even until the last moments. We are called to fight the good fight and run the race till the end. We should strive to live by the Spirit and rest assured that after we have done everything and failed, Jesus will save us by His grace and Mercy. Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ who saves us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Life in the Spirit

[![Life in the Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day326.jpg)](https://youtu.be/t-2wtHngQwc "Life in the Spirit")

##### Day 326 Life in the Spirit

One common question that we come across is ‚ÄúHow to pray?‚Äù, many people struggle with prayer and do not know how to pray. I cannot agree more with St Paul ‚Äúfor we do not know how to pray as we ought‚Äù -Rom 8:26 We more often than not need help with our prayer life, we are not sure how to pray when to pray and for what to pray?
The Holy Spirit comes to our help, teaching us to pray according to the will of the Father.
‚ÄúIn the same way, the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.
27And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God‚Äôs will. ‚Äù Rom 8:26

The Holy Spirit comes to our aid and helps us pray according to the will of God. We verbally pray for God‚Äôs will when we pray the Our Father - Thy will be done thy kingdom come. However, there are many situations and decisions that we need to take in life, praying in the Spirit will help us pray according to God‚Äôs will. Praying in the Spirit can include praying in the gift of tongues, like the disciples after Pentecost and every generation till today.
We are children of God because the Spirt of God dwells within us.
But you are not in the flesh; on the contrary, you are in the spirit, if only the Spirit of God dwells in you. Rom 8:9

We also have resurrection and eternal life because of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs dwelling in us.
If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also, through his Spirit that dwells in you.
The Spirit makes us Children of God, we are made heirs to the kingdom because the Holy Spirit joins with our human spirit to divinize us, so that we are able to become Children of God.
‚Äú For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
15For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, through which we cry, ‚ÄúAbba, Father!‚Äù
16The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
17and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. ‚Äú Rom 8:14-17

It is such a privilege to be filled with the Spirit, led by the Spirit, pray in the Spirit and become Children of God. And this beautiful relationship cannot be take away from us, for nothing can separate us from the love of God. That everything we face in life is for our own good, that God can make beautiful anything even our biggest mistakes.

We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.Rom 8:28
What will separate us from the love of Christ? Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
36As it is written:
‚ÄúFor your sake we are being slain all the day;
we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.‚Äù
37No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly through him who loved us. Rom 8:35-37

And in all things we will be more than conquer, victorious in Jesus' name.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 326 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 5:3 & 9
In lying to Peter, the Pope, Ananias and Sapphira were lying to the Holy Spirit.
It is the same with any Pope because the Holy Spirit guides the Church through the Pope.

The Holy Spirit speaks through all Christians because each receives the anointing of the Holy Spirit through the Sacraments of initiation (Baptism, Communion, Confirmation).

However, sometimes many Christians think that the Holy Spirit is speaking through them when He is not. That is one reason among others why Jesus gave us the Pope and the bishops in union with Him. We can receive clarity from them as to ‚Äúwhat the Spirit is saying to the Church‚Äù (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29 and 3:6, 13, 22).

Acts 5:12‚Äì16
The creative breath of Jesus united the Apostles (His Church) to His Body, and empowered them to breathe His life into a dying world, to make it a new creation. The Apostles were therefore fulfilling this mission with powers which only God possesses, the power to forgive sins (John 20:23) and to work ‚Äúsigns and wonders,‚Äù which were the mighty works of God (Exodus 7:3; 11:10). The Apostles were given His life, which continues in the Church‚Äôs Word and Sacraments, so that we, who have not seen, might inherit His blessings and ‚Äúhave life in His name.‚Äù

Acts 5:38-39
*If this plan or this undertaking is of human origin, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them and in that case you may even be found fighting against God!‚Äù*

When we see someone sharing the Word of God it is not correct for us to silence them. Jesus knows how to take care of His bride and the Holy Spirit blows where He wills, in His own way, to bring people into the Body of Christ (the Church).

On the other hand, as the audience, each one of us has a choice. If we choose to accept the preaching we can stay and if we choose to reject the preaching we can always leave.

Acts 5:41
*So the apostles left the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name (of Jesus).*

The Apostles were happy that they were fulfilling the beatitudes (Mathew 5:10-12).
It is only when we rejoice in our suffering that we are able to unleash the power of the Holy Spirit.
Their joy was based on their faith that God would change their ‚Äúmourning into dancing‚Äù (Psalm 30:11).

Romans 8:1-4
*There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.*

By His death on the Cross, Jesus destroyed the first Adam and by His resurrection He gave us the new Religious and Moral Law (John 15:12; Galatians 5:14). So if we follow the Law and remain in a state of grace at all times then we cannot be condemned, because the power of the sacraments makes it possible for us to live out the Law of Christ even in a negative world.

*For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.*

Jesus suffered and died in obedience to God the Father as an example for us to suffer to the point of death in obedience to God. This was not possible for the old Covenant people because they did not have the power of the risen Christ within them.

In the new Covenant we are able to suffer to the point of death in obedience to God because when we receive the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace, during Mass, Christ dwells within us and suffers with us, until we sin again.

By our baptism we have died with Christ and we have been buried with Christ, which means that we have destroyed the desires of our flesh. Therefore our intention now must be to live only for the desires of our spirit, which is to seek eternal life while we live on earth by living in total obedience to God.

Romans 8:12-17
The Holy Spirit bears witness for us.
According to the law of Moses, if the people had two or three witnesses for violation of the law, they had a case.
The Holy Spirit is poured into us so that Jesus can reproduce in us His divine life, not human life, and also so that Jesus can also reproduce in us His eternal love, not human love, so that our suffering and our dying can be transformed into our participation in the redemptive suffering and death of Christ.

*So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.*

We do not have the power to do what Christ did but when the risen Christ dwells within us, through the reception of the sacraments, He does the needful through us.

Therefore, Paul tells us that we must focus on our spiritual life and not on the desires of our flesh (material life), so that Christ can save people through us.
We must remain in a state of grace at all times so that the Spirit of God can lead us.

*We are God's children by adoption, therefore heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.*

An adopted child has a legal right to share in the inheritance of the father just as a natural child has, but the DNA of an adopted child can never be the same as the DNA of the father's natural child by blood.

Similarly, we are God's children by adoption through our Baptism. Therefore we can share in the inheritance of God the Father but our DNA can never be the same as that of Jesus, which means that, Jesus is God and always will be, but we don't become God when we go to Heaven. By our adoption, Jesus is, and will always be, our older brother and therefore joint heirs with Him.

Romans 8:19-23
*For creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now;*

Creation suffered death and decay because of man's original sin. Therefore, creation awaits restoration through the baptism of man.
But, unfortunately, the piling of unforgiven sins of Christians have made the suffering of creation even worse than before and that is why the earth suffers natural disasters more often now than before (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, storms, cyclones, landslides, earthquakes, etc.).

*And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.*

Although we are baptized, like creation, we too groan because of the many problems we face in our daily lives due to our sinful and weak nature. We will be relieved of our earthly pains only after we reach Heaven.

In baptism we are buried with Christ "body and soul" but only the soul is cleansed of the stain of original sin; the body is not redeemed. The purification of our souls, however, depends on the regular reception of the sacraments through our bodies.

Our body goes through the tests in life; our soul reaps the results.
Our earthly bodies will be left behind on earth and those who go to Heaven will receive new glorified bodies at the end of time.

Romans 8:26
*The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.*

Praying and worshipping God must be done in supreme communion with God which is not possible for us due to the weak and damaged nature of our souls as a result of Original Sin. The devil therefore constantly distracts us in many ways during prayer and worship.
Due to our sinful nature, when we pray we mostly ask for the wrong things.

Because of our wayward state, we are in constant need of the Holy Spirit's assistance in order to merit anything at all in the order of eternity. He has the power to restore us to the right relationship with God as well as to keep us in the right relationship with God. Venial sins and the various disorders of the soul, which we all suffer from, make this essential.

Romans 8:28‚Äì30
*All things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.*

Salvation is a process from our calling to our glorification and the more we are sanctified the closer we get to our salvation (Romans 13:11).

We are called to love God, to delight in His law, and to forsake every false way. We are to conform ourselves daily ever more closely to the image of His Son.
If we do this, we can approach His altar as a pleasing sacrifice, confident that all things work for the good, that we whom He has justified will also be glorified.

All our tribulations will turn out to be mighty blessings if we truly love God by loving our neighbour, and remain focused on God and not on our problems and earthly life.

*What is "divine foreknowledge"* (v. 29)?

To know in advance. This is a power which only God possesses (Psalm 139:1-4). God is in complete control of everything and no one can prevent God from accomplishing His goal (Job 42:1-2).

*What is "Predestination"?*

God has already planned in advance how He is going to handle the salvation of the world inspite of our million sins to destroy God's plan, either directly or indirectly. God's plan for salvation includes the glorification of the Saints to conform to His Son's divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), in other words, those who will be glorified will become mini Christs, therefore we must live like a mini Christ on earth (Galatians 2:20).

To save the world God wants every human to be baptized and to obey the teachings of Christ but if we choose to walk out of God‚Äôs plan then God will not force us.

Predestination does include free will to obey God but if we choose otherwise then God does not force us to obey Him (Sirach 15:14-17). If we disobey Him, He already has a solution planned in advance to reach His goal.
Thus, those who love and obey God are predestined to be glorified according to God's plan (v. 28); those who refuse to obey Him are not included in His plan for salvation.

Are we interested in being part of God's plan for salvation or do we prefer to follow our own agendas?

Romans 8:31
*If God is for us, who can be against us?*

When God delivered the Israelites from slavery and idolatry, neither was it the end of their problems, nor was it the beginning of lifelong celebrations. The Israelites still had to obey God's commandments after their liberation.

God will be for us, not because we are baptized but, only if we obey Him 100%, that is, if everything we do and say is according to His Will.

Romans 8:35-38
*Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Not hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword. For it is written, ‚ÄúFor your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.‚Äù*

Suffering does not separate us from Christ. Suffering unites us to Christ. Suffering can separate us from Christ only when we refuse to go through the suffering and we look for solutions to get rid of the suffering.

From the day we are baptized we must be willing to give up our entire life to Christ in everything we do and say, even if we have to go through suffering. We must suffer willingly so that Christ can suffer through us to save others, and thus use us for the growth of His Kingdom on earth.

Jesus can use anyone who is willing to suffer, at any time, but even if we suffer willingly, our own sins can separate us from Christ.

Therefore, it is necessary that we must be in a state of grace at all times while we also accept our sufferings.

*Neither death nor life‚Ä¶ shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ.*

All Christians belong to the family of God through Baptism.
Our union with Christ and with the other members of the Body of Christ, does not cease at death. Thus, we who are alive on earth can still benefit from the other members of the Body of Christ in Heaven (the saints), by asking them to pray for us, because they are still connected to us in Christ.

##### Origin of the Diaconate

[![Origin of the Diaconate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day327.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sf0Mmd5lXCc "Origin of the Diaconate")

##### Day 327 The role of a Deacon in the Catholic Church.

There are two types of deacons in the Catholic church, transitional deacons and permanent deacons. During the formation of priests, one of the important parts is being a transitional deacon where they spend time at a parish to have first-hand experience of ministry.
The second time type of deacons are permanent deacons, they can be either single or married men who feel the call to serve the church.

At the liturgy, deacons assists the bishop and priests. At the Mass, the deacon proclaims the Gospel, may be invited to preach the homily, and assists at the altar. The deacon may also baptize, witness and bless marriages, preside at the Liturgy of the Hours, and preside at funeral liturgies among many other duties.
The diaconate is not a new ministry but instituted in the early church. We read in the Acts of the Apostles.

At that time, as the number of disciples continued to grow, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
So the Twelve called together the community of the disciples and said, ‚ÄúIt is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve at table.
Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task,
whereas we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.‚Äù

The proposal was acceptable to the whole community, so they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit, also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
Even though the role of the deacons was the serve at tables, Stephen was an exceptional follower of Christ the Bible calls him a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit.

The diaconate was not any volunteer/temporary service but a full time /permanent role that is why we see them having an anointing.

They presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid hands on them. Acts 6:6
The deacons are not just called to do ordinary ministry but can be led by the Spirit to do great service to the church. Stephen was such a good example of going above and beyond one‚Äôs normal duties. We cannot contain the Spirit of God, or put the power of God in a box. The Lord chooses different people to do different works.
Now Stephen, filled with grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people. Acts 6:8

Certain members of the Synagogue come to debate with him and could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke, so they falsely accused before the Sanhedrin, his face was like the face of an angel and when he began to speak such wisdom poured out he was able to put together the salvation history of Israel and spoke with such convictions that they got more and more angry, their hearts were hardened to the Word of God. They decided to stone him to death, but Stephen was so filled with the Spirit that he was able to forgive them even of this sin that cost him his life. He prayed prayers like the ones Jesus‚Äô prayed on the cross.
‚ÄúLord Jesus, receive my spirit.‚Äù

60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he fell asleep. Acts 7:59,60

Thus the first Christina martyr was a deacon, Deacon Stephen. Let us pray for all our dear Deacons in the Church that they be filled with similar grace and zeal for the Kingdom.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 327 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 6:1-3
The conflict between the Hellenists and Hebrews led to a restructuring of the community that would better serve the community‚Äôs needs.

The apostles could have stopped proclaiming the Gospel and started attending to the needs of the widows OR they could have continued proclaiming the Gospel and assured the widows of their prayers for a solution.
But when God sends someone to us with a problem He expects us to get up from our comfort zone and help them practically and not just to assure them of spiritual support. And God doesn't expect us to cancel worship with the excuse of attending to the needy.

The apostles understood this and took action to appoint deacons to attend to the needs of the widows so that the proclamation of the Gospel would continue while the widows would be taken care of.

By allowing problems in the Church, God teaches us how to move forward and how to manage the administration of His Kingdom on earth. That is why God started His Kingdom with inexperienced people. Their humility and dedication to serve the Lord would be the channels through which God would cause the growth of His holy Kingdom with His power. Earthly credentials are of no use when doing God‚Äôs work.

Luke‚Äôs purpose for adding this episode is for introducing Stephen and his martyrdom which is recounted in Acts 7.

Acts 6:5-6
These 7 men were ordained to serve as deacons. Their duty was to assist the Apostles. They were not successors of the Apostles.
Their role was similar to the role of the Levites in the Temple.
Successors of the Apostles are called Bishops.

Romans 9:4-5
*They are Israelites, and to them belong the Sonship (adoption), the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.*

Paul has listed all the gifts which God has bestowed on the people of Israel.
This epistle was written by Paul around one or two decades after the Ascension of Jesus. According to God's plan for salvation, the Gospel was to be preached to the Jews first and then to the gentiles (Romans 1:16). The Jews were the people chosen to evangelize the other nations, because Israel was God‚Äôs first-born son and it was the duty of the first-born son to carry on the priestly duty of the father. Even though Paul was called to preach to the gentiles, he always preached to the Jews first because of his concern for his kinsfolk. When the Jews refused to accept the Gospel Paul went to the gentiles.
Paul was therefore expressing sorrow about the fact that many of the Jews had still not accepted Jesus as their Messiah and Saviour, inspite of them being God's beloved people.

Although all humans are God's children in His image, through Adam (Genesis 1:26), *Sonship* is given only to the consecrated people who live and die in a Covenant relation with God because they bear the likeness of God.
When we destroy the divine life within us with a mortal sin, we retain the image of God but not His likeness.

God dwelt on earth in a special way, only with His consecrated people (the Israelites), in the *Glory cloud.*

The *covenants* were made only with Israel through Abraham and his chosen descendants.

The *old law* was given only to Israel.

Although people of other faiths also worship God in their own way, only Israel was trained on how to *worship* God the way He wants us to, that is, with a liturgical celebration, because God would choose some men from Israel and ordain them through the Messiah to perform priestly duties and offer the prescribed sacrifice to God to constantly purify God's people as long as they lived.

The *promises* of a new Covenant, a new creation and a new heart were given only to Israel. The new Covenant was made by Jesus in the Upper Room, the new creation began on the day of the Resurrection, and we receive a new heart when we are baptized.

In the journey of salvation, the *patriarchs* who were chosen from Israel were all part of the golden thread from Adam to the Messiah (Jesus). The greatest gift to mankind, the Messiah Himself, was one of their kinsfolk.

Thus, God showed His love for Israel by preparing them carefully and giving them the entire package for salvation but unfortunately they rejected God's gift.

##### Day 328 Do not conform yourselves to this age

The challenge that most Christians face today was faced back in the early Church. The Roman and Greek ways of life were ones of indulging in earthly pleasure and satisfying the body. St Paul exhorts us to offer up our lives as a sacrifice, pure and holy, and to be transformed by the renewal of the mind so that we do not conform to the ways of the world but instead be able to discern what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.

I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, your spiritual worship.
Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect. Rom 12:1,2

We should love the Bible and the teachings of the church, study it, and internalize it. We will gain strength and support from the Christian community around us. We are many parts yet on body and we should learn from each other and support one another on this journey.

For as in one body we have many parts, and all the parts do not have the same function,
so we, though many, are one body in Christ and individually parts of one another.
Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them: if prophecy, in proportion to the faith;
if ministry, in ministering; if one is a teacher, in teaching;
if one exhorts, in exhortation; if one contributes, in generosity; if one is over others, with diligence; if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.Rom 12:4-8

Each of us are different, some are good at teaching, some are good in generosity, and some are good in their acts of mercy. We have so many saints in the church today who have many Charisms and gifts.
We should above all accept and love all people in the Church, even if they may seen differently from us.
Few tips to remember:
Let love be sincere; hate what is evil, hold on to what is good
love one another with mutual affection; anticipate one another in showing honor
Do not grow slack in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
Rejoice in hope,
Endure in affliction
Persevere in prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones
Exercise hospitality.
Bless those who persecute, bless and do not curse them.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
Have the same regard for one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly; do not be wise in your own estimation.
Do not repay anyone evil for evil; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all.
If possible, on your part, live at peace with all.
Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good.
Roms 9:9-21

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 328 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 7:2-53
Stephen gave us a brief view of God‚Äôs spiritual family which started with Abraham in the old Covenant. He wants us to understand that God's family is not perfect. It is filled with a lot of imperfect people, some good and some bad.

Acts 7:55-56
*But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked up intently towards Heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.*

Jesus was standing, not sitting on His throne, because He knew that Stephen would soon be killed and He was waiting to honor the first martyr of His Church. Stephen was not afraid of death because he was filled with the Holy Spirit.

And he said, ‚ÄúBehold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.‚Äù\*

Stephen was affirming to the Sanhedrin that the prophecy which Jesus had made before them (Mark 14:62) had been fulfilled.

Acts 7:58
*Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.*

The Jews did not kill Jesus because they did not have the authority to execute anyone (John 18:31) and yet Saul gave the Jews permission to kill Steven. In doing this Saul broke the Mosaic Commandment (‚Äúdo not kill‚Äù).
The congregation was attacked by Saul and his men because Rabbi Gamaliel had strictly told them not to harm the Apostles.

Saul did not kill Stephen with his own hands, but he also did not stop the people from killing.

Sometimes, like Saul, we allow others to commit crimes or do something sinful by not stopping them when we know about it, even though we have not directly contributed towards it, whether someone is planning to divorce, to bribe, to cheat, etc. or whether someone is just gossiping or insulting others, etc.
If we have such an attitude then we are equally guilty of sin as the one who directly committed it (Ezekiel 33:8-9).

Acts 7:60
*Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he died.*

Stephen followed Jesus faithfully even to the point of death. Like his Lord and Master, Stephen too petitioned God to forgive his offenders and thus showed mercy, and his petition opened the door for Jesus to convert Saul (Acts 9:3-6). Saul was later instrumental in bringing thousands of people into the Church.
One act of mercy from Stephen brought salvation to thousands of people.

All Christians are called to do the same. When we petition God to forgive our offenders God‚Äôs grace starts flowing and thus we open the door for Jesus to bring salvation to many.

In a Covenant relation it is the innocent who die for the sins of the wicked. Thereafter, if the victim petitions God to forgive the culprit then, God's grace flows to save the souls of the wicked ones by transforming them.
If the innocent ones are holy, more souls will be saved. The death of Jesus, therefore, has the capacity to save the whole world because He was a sinless man petitioning God to forgive His offenders.

Romans 11:1-5
*I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ‚ÄúLord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.‚Äù But what is the divine reply to him? ‚ÄúI have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.‚Äù So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.*
Just as God had already chosen His saints in the old Covenant, in advance (1 Kings 19:18), so also He has already chosen His saints in the new Covenant, in advance (Romans 11:5), those who are humble and obedient.
Let us therefore humble ourselves and obey all that Jesus has commanded us to do so that we may be counted among the chosen ones.

Romans 11:6
*But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.*
Grace is a gift from God, but if the grace demands payment or something in return, then grace is not a gift. By default, God gives every human the grace to accept Christ. Rejection of Christ is purely human choice.
Grace is, therefore, not the result of our works, but a gift given to all humanity for our own salvation.

Romans 11:11-15
The Gospel was meant to be preached first to the Jews and then to the gentiles (Matthew 15:24).

Paul therefore always preached first to the Jews and when they refused to accept the Gospel he went forward to preach to the gentiles.
Thus the unbelief of the Jews paved the way for the preaching of the Gospel to the gentiles and for their easier acceptance of it outside the context of Jewish culture.

Through his mission to the gentiles, Paul also hoped to fill his fellow Jews with jealousy. Hence he hastened to fill the entire Mediterranean world with the Gospel. Once all the gentile nations would accept the Gospel, Israel as a whole was expected to embrace it.

If Israel‚Äôs rejection of the Gospel causes the whole world to be reconciled with God, then Israel‚Äôs acceptance would be as glorious as the resurrection of the dead.

Romans 11:25-29
In God‚Äôs design, Israel‚Äôs unbelief is being used to grant the light of faith to the Gentiles. Meanwhile, Israel still remains dear to God.

Romans 12:1
Our bodies can be acceptable sacrifices to God only when we offer our bodies in a state of grace along with all our aches and pains, our sicknesses and sufferings, and this offering must be made in union with the sacrifice of Christ offered on the Altar (1 Peter 2:5).

However, if we have a sin and we make a firm commitment to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, then, because of our good intention, we can still offer ourselves to God after making a perfect act of contrition, bearing in mind that we must receive the sacrament soonest.
The fact that we are sorry for our sins is a sign that the grace of God is present and is drawing us back to Him! Thus, we need to cooperate with that grace, pray, and offer ourselves to God.

Romans 12:14-21
*Do good to those who hate you and pray for those who persecute you. Never take revenge. Conquer evil with good.*

Persecution can be internal or external, from our domestic congregation at home or from the official congregation of the Church, from Christians or from non-Christians.
Persecution can be physical or spiritual.
When we choose to follow Christ, we may be strongly opposed or lured into changing our path.

It is not in our power not to feel or to forget the pain caused to us by an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession (CCC 2843).
Because when we pray for our offenders the Holy Spirit transforms our pain into intercession.

When someone attacks us, if we pray only for the safety of our families including ourselves, then we are being selfish because we are asking God to protect us while the evil ones are still running loose attacking other innocent people.
Whereas, if we pray for the conversion of our offenders and they change themselves, then the source of the chaos will be tackled and healed and there will be peace around us.

[![Is Jesus the King of Your Life?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/KingofLife.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tICxaSQFJGo "Is Jesus the King of Your Life?")

HAPPY FEAST:
Solemnity of Christ the King!

Here‚Äôs a beautiful reflection about the feast and its relevance to our daily life:

‚ÄúCome then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,
and bring us with your saints to glory everlasting.‚Äù#divinereadings

##### Day 329 Gifts of the Spirit are not on sale

A man named Simon used to practice magic in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.

10All of them, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him, saying, ‚ÄúThis man is the ‚ÄòPower of God‚Äô that is called ‚ÄòGreat.‚Äô‚Äù
11They paid attention to him because he had astounded them by his magic for a long time,
12but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike were baptized.
13Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds that were occurring, he was astounded.
14Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
15who went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Spirit,
16for it had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17Then they laid hands on them and they received the holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of the apostles‚Äô hands, he offered them money
19and said, ‚ÄúGive me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit.‚Äù
20But Peter said to him, ‚ÄúMay your money perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.
21You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.

We read about Simon the magician who wanted to receive the Holy Spirit and the gifts for his personal gain. He was ready to buy the gifts so that he could use them as he wished. We cannot buy the Holy Spirit or Salvation or anything spiritual. It is a free gift, although it‚Äôs free it was not cheap, the price was Jesus‚Äô death on the cross. We can never get anything from God by paying money, or just doing charity. We have to remember that we cannot earn God‚Äôs love or Mercy we can only receive it as a free gift from God.

The gifts of the Spirit are to build us up and for the common good of the church not for profit or gain.

Also we cannot say that we will be saved on our own by reading the scriptures and praying in our house, we need the Christian community. Like the Ethiopian eunuch, who was reading the scripture and not understanding it.

‚ÄúHow can I, unless someone instructs me?‚Äù Acts 8: 31

We have great resources in the church that can help us learn about our faith and grow in holiness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 329 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 8:1-3
*That day a severe persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria. Meanwhile, Saul was trying to destroy the Church by entering house after house, dragging out the believers, both men and women, and handing them over for imprisonment.*

God makes all things work together for good for those who love God, and are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).
The persecution scattered the Christians throughout the countryside and they started preaching the Gospel to the people there.

Consecration into God's family is an obligation to obey God's Word and to spread the Word of God (Matthew 28:19-20).

It is therefore the obligation of every Christian to evangelize the non-Christians or to help other Christians to know more about the faith or to re-evangelize the fallen away Christians, specially those who they are connected with. But when we become comfortable in our nests and neglect the kingdom work, God may allow a persecution or some calamity in the neighborhood, to drive us out of our comfort zone by force so that we move out and start working for the growth of His kingdom. God doesn't want us to go on lamenting over our trials and tribulations and even persecutions. He wants us to take the opportunity and go out and continue our mission with the gifts / talents which He has invested in us.

In the old Covenant, God allowed the 10 tribes to be dispersed like seeds for the same reason as well as for it to be a punishment for their sins (2 Kings 17:22-23). It was God's Will from the time His people were consecrated that they must obey Him and be a kingdom of priests to spread the Word of God (Exodus 19:5-6).

Acts 8:14-17
*When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. When they arrived, they prayed for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for it had not yet come down upon any of them because they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter and John laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.*

By laying their hands on the people to receive the Holy Spirit, Peter and John conferred the Sacrament of Confirmation. Peter and John had to be sent to Samaria to confer this Sacrament because the authority to lay hands on the people, to receive this Sacrament, was given only to the Bishops/Apostles, and Philip was not a Bishop/Apostle; he was a Deacon.

Baptism brings people into the new Covenant and thus makes them children of God‚Äôs family, thereby permitting them to take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) of the new Passover (Mass), just as circumcision did for the people in the old Covenant (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:43-48). The Holy Spirit is, however, conferred upon the baptized ones separately; in the case of infant Baptism the Holy Spirit is conferred on the children between the ages of 15 and 17, and in the case of adults it is conferred on them soon after Baptism. Therefore, Peter and John were sent to Samaria to do the needful soon after the people were baptized.

Through this sacrament the Holy Spirit gives us charismatic grace to assist us in doing Kingdom work for which we have to give an account to God. When we don‚Äôt take part in any work for God‚Äôs Kingdom, we start creating a brick wall between ourselves and the Holy Spirit.

Acts 8:24
*Simon answered, ‚ÄúPray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.‚Äù*
Simon the magician believed in the power of the Pope.
Simon was afraid when he heard the curse from Peter because by this time he may have heard of what happened to Ananias and Sapphira for grieving the Holy Spirit by lying to Peter, an anointed man of God.

Acts 8:26-38
The eunuch may have been a God-fearing man but because of the Jewish law (Deut. 23:2) he could not become a full member of the Temple (to enter the inner court).
In fulfillment of the old prophecy (Isaiah 56:3-7) the Holy Spirit was beginning to guide the Apostles and their deacons to open the doors of the Church to all people by guiding Deacon Philip to evangelize and baptize the eunuch. Thus, the eunuch would have been the first Christian to take the Gospel to Ethiopia and talk to others about it.

Acts 8:30-31
*Philip asked, ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are reading?‚Äù The eunuch replied, ‚ÄúHow can I understand unless I have a teacher to teach me?"*
If we try interpreting the Word of God on our own we will end up in a disaster like Adam and Eve. It is always advisable to learn the Word of God under the guidance of the right teachers, so that we build a family atmosphere, just as we learnt our basic skills from our parents, teachers, elders, etc., during our childhood.

Romans 13:1
When majority of the Christians live in disobedience to God, the world does not get sanctified and therefore God is not glorified. Jesus commanded us to evangelize the pagan world but when we ignore, neglect or disobey this command the culture becomes corrupt and we get our leaders (religious and political) from this same culture.
But whether we have good government or bad government, we still have to obey them in all things except sin.

Romans 13:12-14
*Let us lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy. Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.*
Voluntary and intentional drunkenness is a mortal sin because it is a voluntary abandonment of the use of reason. It is an act that belongs to the dark world and, according to Paul, those who are addicted to it will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
"Desires of the flesh" are desires of the fallen nature of our human body due to the damaged nature of our souls.

*Put on the armour of Light.*
An armour is used only when people go into battle to fight the enemy. Paul uses this analogy to remind us that we are constantly fighting a spiritual battle with the devils and demons therefore we need the armour of Christ with us always or else we will never know whether we are in God's camp or in the enemy's camp. The enemy sometimes gets violent but most of the time he succeeds in taking us into his camp smoothly and in a friendly manner. From the time we are baptized we must live our lives like Jesus did because it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us (Galatians 2:20).

We can put on the armour of Light every morning after we wake up by starting the day with prayer and meditation on the life of Christ. While we wake up every morning to the natural light of dawn let us also wake up to the supernatural light of Christ.

##### Saul's Conversion

[![Saul's Conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day330.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HOhsUfunEuM "Saul's Conversion")

##### Day 330 The worst sinners make the best saints.

Saul was a young devout Jew, who witnessed the start of the persecution when Deacon Stephen was Martyred by stoning. Paul consented to the execution of Stephen.
The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. Acts 7:58

Now Saul was consenting to his execution. Acts 8:1

Soon after the execution of Stephen on that day, severe persecution caused the church to scatter.
Saul was a zealous Jew and was thinking he was doing God‚Äôs when we went about persecuting the Christians.

Now Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that, if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way, he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.
3On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.
4He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù
5He said, ‚ÄúWho are you, sir?‚Äù The reply came, ‚ÄúI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
6Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.‚Äù
7The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, for they heard the voice but could see no one.
8Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.
9For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank. Acts 9:1-9

Saul‚Äôs conversion account is so striking and dramatic that it seems unreal. Even though Saul did not crucify Jesus, Jesus said ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù. Later on in his letters, Paul will tell us the Jesus is the head and we are his body. What God started at Damascus will impact the early church and the future church ‚Äì ‚Äúus‚Äù in such a great way. Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and helped build most of the early church doctrine and letters. The zeal that Saul showed towards his religion was something that Jesus probably admired. Paul would use that same zeal to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ later.

We should not undermine anyone, no matter how evil they may seem. We do not know their full story yet, God is still working on them. In an instance God can change their hearts and their lives can be amended. Let us continue to pray for them with great fervor.

We know the rest of the story, Ananias was instructed in a vision to go and pray over Saul, was initially reluctant because of Saul‚Äôs persecutor image. Nothing stopped Saul from being baptized. After which nothing stopped him from preaching Christ, he was given such great revelation and such great zeal for the kingdom that no one could stop him.
So let us pray for all the Sauls in our lives that they may be converted to Paul. That they see the real calling in their life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Peter Preaches to the Gentiles

[![Peter Preaches to the Gentiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day331.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xUHaQlJOiLY "Peter Preaches to the Gentiles")

##### Day 331 Proclaiming God‚Äôs Word is accompanied by signs and wonders.

While St Peter was praying he was instructed in a vision that all meats are clean to eat, as he was trying to interpret the vision, the messengers of the Roman centurion Cornelius invited him to go to visit them. Usually, the Jews did not associate with pagans, but led by the Spirit Peter went up to Caesarea(a place of a lot of pagan worship) and visited Cornelius. Cornelius was earlier visited by an angel who instructed him to invite Peter, Cornelius and the other Jews that were gathered there fell down and wanted to worship Peter.

Peter started to proclaim Jesus Christ to the Romans and they believed his teaching.
While Peter was still speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word.

45The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also,
46for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded,
47‚ÄúCan anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?‚Äù Acts 10:44-47

We see that as God‚Äôs word was proclaimed it was accompanied by the great sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit. They also started praying in tongues and glorifying God. Nothing was hidden anymore, Peter was able to see clearly what he seen in the vision, that God made everything and everyone equal that there is no restrictions for anyone to become Christian. Jews and Gentiles alike both need Jesus to be saved.
We see a similar theme in the letter St Paul wrote to the church in Corinth.

When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the mystery of God, I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
2For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
4and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive (words of) wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
5so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God. 1 Cor 2:1-5

Paul did not convince people with his good education and preaching skills. He proclaimed the mystery of God with signs and wonders with a demonstration of the spirit and power. If our faith is based only on human teaching and wisdom, we may not stand strong when trials and temptations come our way. There should be signs and wonders when the Word of God is proclaimed, there should be lives changed and hearts touched by the presence of the Holy Spirit. If the preaching is only head knowledge then we may not get too far, we have to interiorize it and let is work on our hearts.
For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with the wisdom of human eloquence, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its meaning. 1 Cor 1:18
If we are only preaching with human eloquence then we might just be emptying the cross of its meaning. Let us who are preachers be very careful in listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, who will bring to our mind the correct verse or teaching that we should speak.
Let us not limit the working of the Holy Spirit.

‚ÄúWhat eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart, what God has prepared for those who love him, this God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.‚Äù 1 Cor 2:9,10

The Holy Spirit is our teacher and helper who will guide us to see the great banquet that God has prepared for us in heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 331 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 10:9-28
The dietary laws of clean and unclean animals were given to the Jews as a daily reminder to be followed until the Jews and Gentiles would become one body in Christ. The dietary laws were not meant to purify their souls.
The Jewish men were God's first born sons because they were chosen to evangelize the world. The Jews were circumcised to belong to God's family. The gentiles did not belong to God's family because they were not consecrated. If the gentiles would be baptized, then they would be able to share the Body of Christ (Communion) with the Jewish Christians.
The dietary laws were therefore a temporary sign only to set the Jews apart from the Gentiles (Mathew 15:17-20; Colossians 2:16-17).

Acts 10:39
*Peter said, ‚ÄúWe are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.‚Äù*
We are the children of the apostolic witnesses. That is why we still gather on the first day of every week (Sunday) to celebrate the feast of the Resurrection, giving thanks to God for ‚ÄúChrist, who is our life‚Äù (Colossians 3:4).

We live in memory of the Apostles‚Äô witness, like them eating and drinking with the risen Lord at the Altar. And we wait in hope for what they told us would come - the day when we too will ‚Äúappear with Him in glory.‚Äù

The apostolic testimony was not restricted only to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of these words and deeds of Jesus was to be made clear to the developing Christian community as the bearer of the Word of salvation (Acts 1:21‚Äì22).

Acts 10:40
*Peter said, ‚ÄúThen God raised him on the third day.‚Äù*
Peter said that God raised Jesus on the third day, but Jesus said that He had the power to take up His life after His death because He had received this command from His Father (John 10:18).

When we consider the human nature of Jesus, his body needed to be raised from the dead by a power outside of itself. Even a perfect human nature (incorruptible or holy) cannot raise itself from the dead (Acts 13:37).

Therefore, the Spirit of Christ raised the Body of Christ from the dead, the Spirit being divine, because Jesus is fully God as well as fully human.
That is why Jesus said, "destroy this temple (of His body) and *I will raise it up* on the third day‚Äù (John 2:19).

Since God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit work together in unity, it is fitting to say that ‚ÄúGod raised Jesus from the dead.‚Äù

Acts 10:44-48
*While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.*
This second Pentecost was the gentile Pentecost.
Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit before they were baptized. Although in the normal order the Holy Spirit is received after baptism, God can change the order as He wills when a person has strong desire to follow Christ. In Catholic theology this is known as ‚Äúreceiving the grace of the sacrament through desire.‚Äù
Therefore, a person can and will, in certain circumstances, often known to God alone, receive the grace of the sacrament of baptism before receiving the actual sacrament, as also in the case of Apollos (Acts 18:24-25).

The response of Cornelius was a sign that grace was efficaciously working in his life even before he was baptized / purified since God freely gives every human the grace to have faith in Christ, to repent and to be baptized (Ephesians 2:8) because God desires that every human should be saved.

1 Corinthians 1:10-17
The Corinthians had created factions in the Church in the name of Paul, Apollos and Cephas (Peter), depending on who baptized them, and they were also quarrelling with each other due to these factions.

Paul wasn‚Äôt called by God to focus on baptism. Like any other preacher, Paul too was called to preach the Gospel to introduce Christ and the Cross to the people so that they may have faith in Christ. If the people accepted Christ then they would be baptized but it is more important for the non-believers to first believe in Christ.

Divisions in the Church (the heavenly Jerusalem) existed since the beginning of the Church but that is against what was desired by God. Jesus prayed that the Church may be one (John 17:11 & 20-21).

Divisions in the Church are a repetition of what happened at Babel.

Division of God‚Äôs Kingdom is the work of the devil who used the pride of the rulers to cause them to disobey God and thereby divide the earthly Jerusalem (Israel) into the northern and southern kingdoms.

The Corinthian congregation was also falling prey to the same trick of the devil.
Let us pray that we do not fall prey to the same trick by following those who create divisions in the Church.

1 Corinthians 1:22
*For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom......*
Most Jews saw the Crucifixion of Jesus as a helpless and weak man dying on the Cross. Therefore, they were not convinced that Jesus was the Messiah because He didn‚Äôt look like He was capable of leading a nation.
According to the Greeks, Jesus was crucified because He did not have the wisdom to argue His case and defend Himself and the idea of resurrection was not logical because they did not believe in resurrection of the body.

Worldly wisdom is what the people of the world employ to escape suffering and punishment.
Godly wisdom is what the people of God employ to go through suffering and punishment.

1 Corinthians 1:31
*‚ÄúWhoever boasts, should boast in the Lord.‚Äù*
‚ÄúBoasting about ourselves or our achievements‚Äù is a claim that we live and are saved by our own resources.
‚ÄúBoasting in the Lord‚Äù on the other hand, is the acknowledgment that we live only from God and for God.

1 Corinthians 2:4-5
*My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.*
Our faith must be built on the power of Jesus, not on the priests or any spiritual leaders. They are all human messengers of Christ and therefore likely to fall.

##### Day 332 Do you not know ‚Äì you are the temple of God.

Many people search for God in many places and through many experiences. We can sometimes fail to overlook the dwelling of God in our hearts.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone destroys God‚Äôs temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy. 1 Cor 3:16-17

The Holy Spirit has been poured into our hearts and we are filled with the love of God. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and God dwells in us. We should not abuse or destroy our bodies because we are God‚Äôs holy temple. Many sins like excessive drinking, eating, smoking, starving and the like are sins against the body which is the temple of God.

Given that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we must not fail to recognize that other people‚Äôs bodies are also the temple of the Holy Spirit. This helps us respect other people's bodies, knowing that God dwells in them. This is the reason why we should not verbally or physically abuse anyone, because everyone is a creation of God and they are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

We cannot submit any of our body parts to evil activity as the whole body belongs to Christ.
Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.
13And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness. Rom 6:12-13

Let not sin reign in your bodies but let us use our bodies for the sake of the kingdom. Let us use all the strength that we have to serve the Lord and the serve the poor. We should use our bodies as weapons for righteousness. Dress modestly and give glory to God, let people see us, and glorify the Lord. We are all created beautiful so let us not fail to smile.

" Let the smile on our faces reflect the presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. " - Michael Eltham

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Acts 11:1-18
Admitting a Gentile into the Church with the Jews was going to cause a huge scandal. But the Holy Spirit chose Peter, the Pope / Vicar of Christ, to do the needful because, as commanded by Jesus, all must obey the one who sits in the Seat of Moses (Mathew 23:2-3), which was now given to Peter (Mathew 16:18).

Peter was chosen by Jesus to be the prince of the apostles and the first leader of the Church, but he too had difficulty understanding the plan of God. He had to learn everything step by step, as from kindergarten to graduation. God had to show Peter the vision three times for him to finally understand what God was trying to tell him. Jesus was teaching him the spiritual symbolism of unclean animals through examples just as He spoke to them in parables when He was on the earth with them.

The transition from old Covenant to new Covenant was not easy for the apostles because nothing was given to them in detail, either orally or in writing.
The Church grew purely through the power of the Holy Spirit working in the Apostles and the early Christians.

1 Corinthians 3:1-9
To be ‚Äúof the flesh" means we have still not overcome our physical appetites for the comfort and pleasures of our earthly life.

Like the Corinthians, many of us too get involved in discussing and quarrelling about earthly matters. That is because we have not asked the Holy Spirit help us overcome our earthly concerns, and to guide and lead us towards spiritual concerns.
When we are in the flesh our pride rules our life, and therefore we look at life from a human perspective which does not take into account the divine perspective and the Will of the Lord.

The Corinthian Christians were creating factions within God's family (the Church) and quarrelling with each other, much like the factions which we create within our earthly families, within our communities, within our countries and in the world.

Let us take a look at our lives and check whether we are ruled by pride or by humility. Are we looking at life from a human perspective or from the divine perspective?
To make an honest check of ourselves and look at life from the divine perspective we need to spend some alone time with the Lord in silence, like Jesus (Matthew 14:23; Mark 1:35).

1 Corinthians 3:5-7
*Paul said "what is Paul? What is Apollo's? I planted, Apollo's watered but God was causing the growth. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything."*
Bringing others to Christ is not about us or what we have done. We may sow the seeds of the Gospel by evangelizing, and we may water these seeds with prayer and fasting, and helping the people nourish their spiritual lives, but it can only take root if the person is willing to co-operate with God‚Äôs grace. We are not the ones who convert anyone. It is God who converts people. God alone, who makes the Church grow in His likeness, is everything, and therefore He alone deserves all the glory.

If we have been instrumental in bringing people to the Church or close to God, we must ensure that we don't encourage others to give us praise or rewards.

Meanwhile, God can cause the growth of the Church only if we sow the seeds. If we are not doing what we are called to do then we are depriving many souls of eternal life therefore we will be culpable.

When God gives us a task He provides workforce, resources, etc. for getting the task accomplished. But God‚Äôs call to serve Him as co-workers is not only to a selected few; it is a call to all believers in Christ. The preaching and spreading of the Gospel is also the responsibility of all believers. We are all co-workers with Christ, and when we are committed to expanding the Kingdom of God on earth, *NOTHING* should hinder us from rendering undisturbed service to God.

1 Corinthians 3:15
*If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire.*
Those who die in a state of venial sin will be gathered in Purgatory, and all those who make it to Purgatory will be saved. But during the purification process the works done during their lifetime will be evaluated (v.11-15).
Works that were built on the foundation of Christ, akin to ‚Äúgold, silver, and precious stones‚Äù, will survive and the person will be rewarded greatly. These are works done in Christ with pure motives.

But works that are analogous to ‚Äúwood, hay, and stubble‚Äù will be burned up. These are the venial sins or good works done with impure motives, such as helping the poor and needy for personal gain or glory.

The ‚Äúloss‚Äù suffered is a loss of greater reward. Salvation is, however, assured, but the level of glory will be less for the one whose ‚Äúwork is partially burned up.‚Äù In order to go to heaven, some of his works will have to be accepted (unless he died before the age of accountability). But since some of his works are ‚Äúburned up‚Äù he will not receive as great a reward as he would have received if all his works would have been accepted.

1 Corinthians 3:16-17
*Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person, for God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.*
God‚Äôs Spirit (divine life) is given to us when we are baptized (Matthew 28:19). But when we commit a mortal sin, we destroy the divine life within us (Genesis 2:17), thereby destroying God‚Äôs temple. We can, however, restore that divine life only after we receive the Body of Christ (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27).

If we die with a mortal sin we will not have divine life within us, thereby destroying our soul (God‚Äôs temple) forever.

Knowing the weakness of our souls, God has given us the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist. We must therefore be alert to sin at all times, live our lives according to God's Will and receive the sacraments regularly because the evil one is active 24/7 waiting to drag all Christians into his kingdom in many different ways.

1 Corinthians 4:1
\*Thus should one regard us: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.‚Äù
Jesus gave His apostles the authority to dispense the mysteries of God (sacraments).

##### Day 333 The resurrection of the body

We sometimes tend to think that only our souls go to heaven, our bodies decay and are gone in the earth. However, scripture and tradition help us understand that we will be resurrected both body and soul.

‚ÄúThe body, however, is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body;
God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.‚Äù 1 Cor 6:13,14

God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead established itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the whole man, soul and body. CCC 992

St Paul urges us to avoid all sins against the body, especially sexual immorality.

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take Christ‚Äôs members and make them the members of a prostitute? Of course not!
16\[Or\] do you not know that anyone who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For ‚Äúthe two,‚Äù it says, ‚Äúwill become one flesh.‚Äù 1 Cor 6:15-16

We cannot indulge in any form of sexual immorality, whether it be prostitution or even lust of the eyes. When we give into these sins we are uniting ourselves to the evil in the world.
We are called to be united to Christ, one spirit with him.

But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
18Avoid immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:17,18

The one who commits sexual immoral sins, commits these sins against his/her own body. These sins can become very addictive and can weaken the conscience. These sins are mortal sins and can send us to hell if they are not forgiven.

Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor 6:9

Let us repent from all of these sins listed above, least we are denied entry into heaven. Let us not take these sins lightly, they are grave sins. We should keep our body holy as we are united with Christ. Our bodies will also be resurrected to heaven so let‚Äôs keep our body holy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### BIAY Day 333 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Corinthians 5:4-5
*When you are assembled, and my spirit is present with the power of our Lord Jesus, you are to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.*

An ex-communicated member of the Church is not allowed to have access to the sacraments and this puts the person's soul in the power of Satan who takes pleasure in destroying the body in whatever way he can. Paul was hoping that this would bring the man to repentance and thereafter back to the Church, and it did.

1 Corinthians 5:1-8
In his role as an Apostle/Bishop of the Church, Paul's responsibility was to ensure the purity of the souls entrusted to him, not only by purging the evil (leaven) from their midst but also by repairing the damaged souls of his congregation, so that they could celebrate the Passover feast of the new Covenant (Mass), as it was commanded in the old Covenant, without any publicly known mortal sin (leaven) in their midst (Exodus 12:15 & 19).

If a Bishop gets comfortable by only purging out the evil members and not caring about the renewal of their souls, then he is culpable in front of God.
On the other hand, if the mortal sin of a member of the congregation has become publicly known, then it is the responsibility of the congregation to notify the Bishop about it.

Therefore Paul was not happy to hear that the Corinthians were proud about their many spiritual gifts when they had ignored the most important thing, the leaven in their midst, which they should have tackled.

While Paul was with the Corinthians he had worked hard to purge out evil from the Church and repair the damaged ones, and after he left he expected them to follow what he taught them, but he was disappointed with them because they had either not learnt anything from him or they were too afraid to take the initiative.

The man, referred to, had violated the law (Leviticus 18:8). Paul did not want the immoral man taking part in the breaking of the bread (Mass) (v. 7-8) along with the congregation because he had committed a mortal sin with his act. And if the man received the Body of Christ (Communion) with a mortal sin then he would not only be bringing judgement upon himself (1 Corinthians 11:27) but his sin would spread like cancer because others would be encouraged to follow his example. Paul wanted the cancer to be removed so that the Body of Christ (the Church) would not be defiled.

Paul therefore ordered the Corinthians to ex-communicate the man (v. 2) who was unfaithful to Christ, in line with the Law given by Jesus (Matthew 18:18).

Ex-communication is analogous to divorce due to infidelity (Matthew 5:32 & 19:9) and is meant to humble the unfaithful person so that he repents, corrects his errors and comes back to his spouse. If the ex-communicated person refuses to humble himself and return to his spouse (Jesus) then his soul will be lost. The same applies to women also.

Paul had commanded the congregation to surrender this man to Satan so that the man‚Äôs flesh may be dealt with (by going through suffering as a chastisement) and thus his spirit/soul may be saved.

*You are to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.*
This was the language Paul used for ex-communication. It was seen as medicinal.
Paul understood that God will ‚Äúhand us over‚Äù to Satan in various ways in our lives for our purification and our ultimate good, though we always have free will. We can choose whether, or not, we want to cooperate with God‚Äôs chastisement which leads to our salvation (Hebrews 7:8-12).
Paul himself had gone through the experience of being handed over to Satan (2 Corinthians 12:6), as did Job (Job 1).
Ex-communication of a person is, however, only done in extreme circumstances, if, after several warnings, the person still refuses to repent and correct his/her errors. It is never what the Church desires, but sometimes it is necessary in order to stop the cancer from spreading and to cause the person to humble himself/herself and repent.

1 Corinthians 5:7-8 (1)
*Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.*
Why did Paul refer to Jesus as ‚Äúour Passover‚Äù?

Jesus was not the first person to be crucified and Roman executions happened almost every day. But what transformed an ordinary Roman execution into a true and complete sacrifice was its connection with the Last Supper, or the first Passover of the New Covenant, in the Upper Room.

In the Jewish Passover feast the most important part was the sacrifice of the Lamb and consumption of all 4 cups of wine. The slaughtered lamb had to be offered to God by a Priest, on the Altar. But a sacrificed lamb didn‚Äôt become a Passover lamb unless it was sacrificed for the Passover feast and unless the family followed all the instructions of the Passover celebrations. If any one step was missed out then God would be displeased with them.

In this first Passover feast of the new Covenant, Jesus was the High Priest. He went to the Cross with His sacrificial priestly garments (the seamless tunic) (John 19:23). Jesus consumed three cups of the Passover wine in the Upper Room with His ordained priests (the Apostles), and thereafter consumed the fourth cup of wine after His Body was sacrificed/crucified, His Body being the Altar, to unite His sacrifice (the Lamb of God) with the Passover meal (the Last Supper) which he started in the Upper Room. It is now the obligation of the new Israel (the Christians) to consume the sacrificial meal (the Body of the Lamb of God) to complete the Passover feast until the end of time (Exodus 12:47).

Thus in the first Passover feast of the new Covenant, Jesus was the High Priest, the Passover Lamb and the Altar.

1 Corinthians 6:19-20
*Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body.*

Our bodies (which we can see) are an analogy for our souls (which we cannot see).
Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit and are meant to be used in a godly way for godly things, to do God's work on earth. That is why God gave us a body and our bodies belong to the Lord.

Our body becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit when we live in a state of grace. Using our bodies for sinful words and deeds is scandalous to the Holy Spirit, therefore we must avoid vices, addictions, etc. Thus, whatever we use our body for and whatever we do to our body has a direct effect on our soul.

Therefore, we must glorify God by using our bodies to evangelize, to create new life, to worship God, to do good works, to love others, etc.

Acts 13:9
*But Saul, also known as Paul, .......*
Paul's Jewish name was Shauul, the English version being Saul,
and his Greek name was Pavlos, the English version being Paul.

Acts 13:1-52
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/13/1-5
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/13/13-15
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/13/43-52

During the liturgical service of the Old Covenant, the priests read the Law of Moses and the corresponding writings of the prophets. Then they explained the law to the people and celebrated with a sacrificial meal (Nehemiah 8:2‚Äì10).

God had showed them, through Moses, how to conduct a liturgical service so that they would not have any difficulty when they switched to the New Covenant worship. But, after the Resurrection, the Jews, who had not accepted Christ, still continued reading only the Law and the Prophets.

Paul additionally preached the Gospel and delivered a sermon/homily to the people, as Jesus taught His disciples (Luke 24:27, 30-32 and 45-47), so that the people could understand the link between the old Covenant and the new and that Jesus was the promised Messiah whom the prophets spoke about.

The Church still follows the same pattern to this day. Therefore, during the liturgical service (Mass), every Sunday, we have four Readings (each from the Old Testament, Psalm, New Testament and Gospel).

After hearing the Gospel the first time, many Jews and Gentiles wanted to hear the Word of God again. But the following Sabbath when some Jews saw that the crowds had increased and Paul was getting popular, they were filled with envy and opposed his teaching. God wanted the Gospel to be preached throughout Israel, but since the Jews rejected Christ, Paul and Barnabas turned to the gentiles who willingly accepted Christ and many were converted.

Meanwhile, the envious Jews, along with the influential people of that town, plotted a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their town. Before leaving town, in obedience to the instructions of Jesus, Paul and Barnabas shook off the dust from their feet in judgement for rejecting Christ (Matthew 10:14-15; Mark 6:11).

Acts 13:13
*Then Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem.*
Paul and John Mark were working together to serve the Lord but it seems like something happened that created a wall between them and John Mark walked out.
We do not have details of why John Mark left them but what is more important is that Paul and Mark later reconciled with each other (2 Timothy 4:11; Philemon 24).

We should therefore not be scandalized or lose our faith when Church authorities have issues with each other because it is not something new. It has been the case since the beginning of the Church because Church authorities are human, like us, and will therefore tend to fall from grace very often due to the weakness of their souls.

Just as Satan tried to destroy the physical Body of Christ by instigating a priest of God (Judas) from within the ministry of Christ, so also Satan will try to destroy the Church (the mystical Body of Christ) by instigating a priest of God from within the Church.
The important thing is that when Church authorities have tension between each other, they must not hold long-term grudges. They must eventually calm down, realize their errors and reconcile with each other.

During such times it is the duty of the congregation to pray for them and help them to reconcile.

Acts 13:40
The Mosaic law does not give us salvation. It was given to the old Covenant people to prepare and train them on how God wanted to be worshipped in the new Covenant.

Acts 13:43
*‚Ä¶.. continue in the grace of God.*
Paul and Barnabas urged the people to continue in the grace of God because baptism is not a guarantee for salvation. Once we are baptized there are 100% chances that we can ‚Äúfall from grace‚Äù as Paul reminds us (Galatians 5:4) because Satan‚Äôs main targets are the baptized ones.

Spiritual life is all about walking with Jesus and remaining in Christ, therefore, with the demons keeping an eye on us 24x7 and waiting round the corner to grab our souls, it is not easy to be in a state of grace always. Sometimes the demons do it through violence and sometimes through false friendship, deceptive love, etc.

Jesus sums up the reason very plainly:

‚Äú‚Ä¶ apart from me, you can do nothing‚Äù (John 15:5),

Paul also tells us:
I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me (Phil. 4:13).

For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life‚Äù (Romans 2:6-7);

Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his own flesh will, from the flesh, reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will, from the Spirit, reap eternal life. And let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we do not lose heart‚Äù (Galatians 6:7-9).

Let us therefore ensure that we stay alert to sin and keep our souls purified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, as long as we live.

1 Corinthians 7:32-35
It is not wrong to ordain married people to religious life but it is difficult for a person to do justice to married life and religious life at the same time. Therefore, Paul recommends celibacy for those choosing religious life so that they can focus on serving God by serving only the official Church (their parish congregations).

Meanwhile, married people can focus on serving God by serving their domestic Churches (their families) while they also assist the official Church.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

##### Day 334 Celibacy makes for dedicated service to the Lord.

A very practical reason for priests and religious taking the vow of celibacy is the freedom to serve the Lord. This is a small ‚Äòt‚Äô tradition of the Catholic Church.
If we think of it in a very practical sense, a married man/woman is focused on the family, and how to make the spouse, children, parents, and in-laws happy. Preparing meals, dropping of the kids to school and sports, caring for elderly parents, saving money for college tuition, praying as a family, and raising good kids. I don‚Äôt think any parent reading this will say they have enough of time or resources to be a married person, it seems never enough. If we add the service of the Lord to the equation, either one would be neglected, although this is not the case always ‚Äì there are many people in lay ministry that are able to balance both family and the Lord‚Äôs service. For example a permanent deacon has threefold responsibilities, family, work and deaconate. However for a parish priest, bishop, cardinal, pope, nun, mother superior, religions priest being single would be most practical as they are able to dedicate 100% of their time and energy for the service of the Lord.

I should like you to be free of anxieties. An unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.

33But a married man is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife,
34and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord, so that she may be holy in both body and spirit. A married woman, on the other hand, is anxious about the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 1 Cor 7: 32-34

It is great to be single and serving the Lord, but in all truth anyone who had taken the vow of celibacy in all truth is not single but married to the Lord. Their spouse is the Lord and the community is their family.

However, sometimes it‚Äôs not practical for some people to live a celibate life as they may not be called to it or may not have the willpower to abstain from sex. Or if they feel too lonely without someone to share their life with.
If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, and if a critical moment has come and so it has to be, let him do as he wishes. He is committing no sin; let them get married.

37 The one who stands firm in his resolve, however, who is not under compulsion but has power over his own will, and has made up his mind to keep his virgin, will be doing well. 1 Cor 7: 36-37

We should pray for our priests and religious to be able to continue in their firm resolve to live celibate lives with undivided love for Christ and the Church.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Run the Race

[![Run the Race](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day335.jpg)](https://youtu.be/51YSft7AXMk "Run the Race")

##### Day 335 Strive for salvation.

I feel that zeal for salvation is lacking in our generation, we see people taking great care to secure a job, educate their kids, save for retirement, get promotions, build their bodies, diet etc. We do so much for the earthly life and do very little for the eternal life. Look at any athlete or sports person, they dedicate their whole lives to sport and aim to win a medal. However, everyone will forget about the game or the medal in a few hours. How much more should we prepare for our eternal goal?
Do you not know that the runners in the stadium all run in the race, but only one wins the prize? Run so as to win.

25Every athlete exercises discipline in every way. They do it to win a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
26Thus I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight as if I were shadowboxing.
27No, I drive my body and train it, for fear that, after having preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. 1 Cor 9:24-25

We should take a moment to compare the efforts that we make to secure our earthly life as compared to eternal life. Make a list of all the things you do for spiritual life, Bible in a year, Daily Mass, regular confession, personal prayer, and charity, ‚Ä¶.

Compare it to the list that you have for earthly life, job, learning, savings, diet, exercise‚Ä¶.
Hopefully, you are making more effort for eternal life, striving, running the race, training our spiritual bodies, and depriving our earthly bodies of good things so that our heart, mind and body is focused on the main goal which is eternal life. All these earthly things will be added on. Let us run and win, I‚Äôm sure we all will need God‚Äôs grace to be saved. But that should not stop our striving, it should fuel our striving. The worst case would be if we preach to others and fail to live out our calling.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Council at Jerusalem

[![The Council at Jerusalem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day336.jpg)](https://youtu.be/i9JLabc1K1E "The Council at Jerusalem")

##### BIAY Day 336 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 15:2
*No less dissention.*
This was Luke's polite way of saying that there was a huge explosive argument due to disagreement, that it almost led to a quarrel.
The members of the council didn't end up in dividing the Church in response to the difference of opinion. They made a common decision and then abided by that decision. That is the principle of an ecumenical council.

Acts 15:1-12
*Why was there a huge debate in the early Church?*

Paul‚Äôs refusal to impose the Mosaic Law upon the gentile converts, provoked very strong objection from the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem. This was one of the common problems in almost all the first century Churches (Romans 3:21-31; Galatians 3:1-5).
For more than a thousand years they were given to understand that, according to the Mosaic Law, an uncircumcised man, along with his family, cannot be part of God‚Äôs family (Genesis 17:12-14).

Although they understood that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism, they were unable to understand why the gentiles were being baptized and allowed into the Churches, without being circumcised.

When the Jewish Christians from the sect of Pharisees started spreading the wrong message, it created confusion within the entire Church.
This topic led to a huge debate between the Apostles and the priests, until Peter stood up during the Council at Jerusalem, and in his authority as the Pope / Prime Minister of God‚Äôs Kingdom (the Church), he made the final decision, through the power of the Holy Spirit, that people could now enter the Church and be part of God‚Äôs family through faith followed by baptism, not circumcision.
Thus baptism replaced circumcision.

The purpose of showing Peter the vision (Acts 10:9-16) and sending him to preach to Cornelius and his household earlier (Acts 10:19-20), and thereafter to baptize them (Acts 10:48), was to teach Peter that the Mosaic rituals were soon to be replaced with new rituals. With the Cornelius event in mind, the Holy Spirit may have also reminded Peter that before the Ascension, Jesus did not command them to circumcise all nations, but to baptize them.

Therefore, Paul‚Äôs refusal to impose the Mosaic law on the gentile Christians was supported by Peter on the ground that within his own experience God bestowed the Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household without pre-conditions concerning the adoption of the Mosaic law.

Satan always uses his disciples to create problems and confusion, but God allows those problems to teach us how to move forward on the right path, and we will do well if we live in obedience to God‚Äôs commandments.

The Apostles had not addressed this issue earlier, therefore by allowing this problem in the Church God was teaching the Apostles how to organize and develop the Church, just as God allowed problems in the House of Israel to teach Moses how to organize and develop his community (Exodus 18:19-24; Numbers 11:16).

Debates and problems in the Church between the bishops and the clergy are common and are required to help the Church grow. These are times of trial which we must go through for purification and growth. When there's a difference in opinion, a meeting is called and the debate begins with a prayer for guidance from the Holy Spirit. After the debate a common decision is arrived at.
The important thing is that the Church remained unified inspite of the debate.

When the Church is challenged by heresies then it becomes necessary to hold a council and come to a decision in order to protect the faith of its entire congregation.

However, when the faith of a minority is shaken by heresies, then the Bishop may resolve the issue through epistles as Paul did.

The council at Jerusalem was the first council held by the Church but not the only one. Thereafter many councils have been held, as and when the need arose.

The *Mosaic Civil law* was not required to be followed universally because it applied only to Israel. Therefore, it was eventually deleted.
However, the *Mosaic Religious and Moral laws* must be followed by the subjects (the Christians) of the holy Kingdom, and therefore cannot be deleted. They were however gradually modified with the guidance of the Holy Spirit to suit the new Covenant requirement due to the change in priesthood (Hebrews 7:12).
Acts 15:7-21
Peter spoke on behalf of everyone and gave a doctrinal pronouncement about what the Church believes (Acts 15:7‚Äì12) because Peter was the first Pope / Prime Minister, and James gave a practical solution (Acts 15:13‚Äì21) because James was the Bishop of Jerusalem.

The Apostles (bishops) and presbyters (priests), in agreement with the whole Church (the laity), wrote a letter to the gentile Christians with their decision which became the new Law of the Church (Acts 15:22‚Äì29).

https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/7%E2%80%9312
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/13%E2%80%9321
https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Acts/15/22%E2%80%9329

1 Corinthians 11:10
*For this reason a woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.*
This is a warning that gender confusion and improper attire, during worship, will offend the heavenly hosts. Angels are ministers of the natural order and angels are present during the sacramental worship of the Church (Hebrews 12:22). Therefore it is important that we stand in front of the Altar with modest clothing.

1 Corinthians 11:26
*For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord‚Äôs death until he comes.*
Paul, and the other Apostles, always ended the proclamation of the Gospel with breaking of the bread (Mass).

‚ÄúProclaiming the Gospel‚Äù means that during every (Mass) the Christians must re-live the ministry of Christ on earth from the baptism of Jesus to His resurrection, where the Priest represents Christ and the congregation represents the first disciples of Christ during His ministry on earth.

‚ÄúProclaiming the Gospel‚Äù includes :

> > ) forgiving the people‚Äôs sins (through the Penitential Rite);
> > ) glorifying God (The Gloria).
> > ) reading the scriptures from Old & New Testament, Psalms & Prophets;
> > ) preaching the Gospel;
> > ) teaching the people how to apply the Gospel to their lives with reference to the readings of the day (through the homily);
> > ) consecrating the bread and wine and offering them to God as a perfect sacrifice in atonement for sins (anamnesis / re-living the Upper Room and Calvary events); and,
> > ) celebrating the Resurrection by eating the sacrificial meal / the Body of Christ (Communion) (re-living the post resurrection events) (Luke 24:30).

1 Corinthians 11:27-30
Paul uses judicial language because when we receive the Body of Christ in an unworthy manner (with a mortal sin) we are abusing the Body of Christ and therefore breaking the Covenant with God, the result of which we have seen in the case of Judas (Acts 1:18) when he made the same mistake (John 13:27).

When we continuously abuse the Body of Christ / Eucharist we are in a continuous Covenant with Satan, which is the reason why we have so many problems in life. Receiving the Body of Christ with a mortal sin is like playing with fire.

A person cannot become guilty of eating and drinking the Body and Blood of Christ unworthily if the bread and wine were not the real Body and Blood of Christ.

During every Mass when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution ‚Äúthis is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant‚Äù (Matthew 26:28) we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse (Revelation 16:1-17).
During every Mass we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement.

1 Corinthians 11:27
Our sacrifice becomes cause of our judgement when it is offered with an unclean heart because we offer a sacrifice for the renewal of a Covenant, not a contract.

When we don‚Äôt receive the Body of Christ / Communion in a state of grace or we do not attend the new Covenant Passover celebration (Mass) every Sunday, God is glorified less than He should be and the world is sanctified less than it should be.

It is, therefore, not surprising that sin in the world is increasing, thus giving Satan the power to cause famines, natural disasters, crisis at state / national / global level, problems between family members, terminal illnesses, and suffering & misery in many other forms.

1 Corinthians 12:12‚Äì13
*For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, and all were made to drink of one Spirit.*
We (the body parts of Christ) are united with Christ (the Head) through our Baptism.
One single part of the human body cannot say that *it is a body.* It can only be *a part* of the human body. But when all parts are in union with each other then they become *one body.*
Likewise, each individual Christian cannot say that he/she is the Body of Christ. We become one body only when we are all united in Christ by receiving the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace. If any one of our body parts is separated permanently, it would definitely decay. Moreover, a separated body part cannot function on its own, without the head, because it will have no life.
Therefore, if we don't live our Christian lives in union with Christ (the Head), then our sinful soul will eventually decay and end up in Hell.

##### Day 336 The gifts of the Holy Spirit.

In our modern day and age, we seem to have either suppressed or forgotten the gifts of the Holy Spirit. St Paul urges us not to be unaware of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Now in regard to spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be unaware.
There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;
5there are different forms of service but the same Lord;
6there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. 1 Cor 12:1-6

There are different gifts but there is only one reason for them, for the service of the Lord. All these gifts are given to us by the same Spirit. These gifts can be used to edify our own spiritual lives and the lives of everyone around us. The gifts are for the building up of the church. The gifts do not make one great or one insignificant, let us remember that it is a gift we did not earn it or deserve it.
To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
9to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;
10to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues. 1 Cor 12:8-10

The gifts can be listed as:

1. Wisdom
2. Knowledge
3. Faith
4. Healing
5. Mighty deeds(Miracles)
6. Prophecy
7. Discernment of spirits
8. Tongues
9. Interpretation of tongues

The gift of knowledge is to gain supernatural insight into something or someone‚Äôs life like people have a vision of something or a strong feeling that the Holy Spirit is speaking to them about something.

The gift of Wisdom is similar to knowledge only difference is it‚Äôs usually direction from the Holy Spirit on how to act, it‚Äôs more like getting hearing Holy Spirit teach us the will of God or at least a hint about what God wants us to do.
The gift of Faith is not just regular faith that we all have, faith the Jesus is God and the other basic teachings of the church. The gift of Faith is a supernatural gift that we gain such confidence at a certain moment that we know that we are able to pray for God‚Äôs supernatural intervention.
People with the gift of healing can lay hands and pray over the sick for natural or supernatural healing.

The gift to work mighty deeds and Miracles are a great sign for the non-believers.
A person with the gift of prophecy is able to listen to the Spirit and speak out God‚Äôs words, usually, you will hear the person with this gift say ‚ÄúI sense the Lord saying‚Äù followed by the message ‚Äì it usually is a like a verse from the Bible. The prophecy should always be in alignment with the teaching of Jesus and the church.

The gift of discernment of spirit is a gift that will help us know the where the prophecy is coming from or what spirit is behind a certain action. Like a person who seems to be possessed by the evil may actually only have a medical problem. Anyone with the gift of discernment will be able to discern if it‚Äôs because of evil spirit or not.

The gift of tongues is one of the most common gifts, the person with the gift of tongues prays according to the will of the Father in mourns and groans too deep for any human language to explain. But God who looks into the hearts knows the intent.

The gift of tongues is most useful to the congregation when someone has the gift of interpretation of tongues. So that everyone in the congregation will be able to know what the person praying in tongues has just prayed.
Although the gifts of the Spirit may see pretty spectacular, we should not use the gifts as a yardstick for the greatness of the person. Because the gifts are not earned but given, the gifts will cease but one thing will remain. Let us wait till tomorrow to know what is greater than any gift.

Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.
But I shall show you a still more excellent way. 1 Cor 12:31

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### The Importance of Love

[![The Importance of Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day337.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ekHYubXUoCA "The Importance of Love")

##### BIAY Day 337 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 16:3
*Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.*

Paul wanted Timothy to be circumcised because the Jews would not allow an uncircumcised man to enter their territory. The Jews still strongly believed that every man had to be circumcised, whether he wanted to be a member of the Temple or the Church. Paul needed Timothy to assist him in his religious work so the only option left was to circumcise Timothy so that they could both enter the Jewish areas and continue their work.

Although the decision had been made during the first council that circumcision was not required to enter the Church, Peter's encyclical had not yet reached all the Churches (v. 4). It was therefore very important for Paul to visit those areas to settle the disputes between the Jews and the gentiles.

Since circumcision was ordained by God, Timothy was willing to go through it for the sake of the Gospel.

In the process of doing God's work, like Timothy, we must be willing to sacrifice our comfort, if we have to, for the sake of the Gospel, making sure that whatever we do is according to God's Will.

Acts 16:6-10
Everything that Paul was doing for the Church was good work but there's a difference between doing good work and God's work.

Paul had a desire to go to preach in Asia, but God had different plans. God wanted Paul to focus his preaching more in the Greeko-Roman territory because of his knowledge of multiple languages and the culture of the people. Although Paul's intentions were good and he was doing his work for the Lord, he humbled himself and submitted himself to the Lord's desire.

It was at this point that Paul met Luke. Also, the Macedonians were in some kind of trouble and they needed urgent help.

If Paul had gone to Asia against God's Will then maybe he would not have met the evangelist Luke and the Macedonians would not have been saved on time.

Like Paul, sometimes when we have a particular plan laid out to do God‚Äôs work, God may inspire our superiors to use our potential in a different way or in a different area that may not have been in our plans. During such time let us humble ourselves and submit ourselves to the Lord's desire, even if we don't like the new mission, rather than fighting with our superiors and being adamant about following only the desire of our heart. If we forcibly decide to do God's work our own way then the good work which we do is not God's work because it is being done in disobedience to God and therefore contrary to God‚Äôs plan. In the process of doing God's work, like Paul, we must be willing to sacrifice our plans for the sake of the Gospel. If we allow pride to stand before us, God may give the chance to someone else and not use us at all.

Evangelisation is not about doing God's work the way *we* want it done.
Evangelisation is about doing God's work the way *God* wants it done.
When in doubt, always pray.

Acts 16:25-27
*About midnight, while Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God as the prisoners listened, there was suddenly such a severe earthquake that the foundations of the jail shook; all the doors flew open, and the chains of all were pulled loose. When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew \[his\] sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.*

Paul and Silas were beaten and thrown in prison but they did not complain or curse their offenders. Instead, they spent their time in prison praying and singing hymns to God. Therefore, through their suffering Jesus converted the jailer.
God allowed the earthquake and opened the gates of the prison to move the jailer to ask for salvation.

Acts 16:30-31
*Then the jailer brought them out and said, ‚ÄúSirs, what must I do to be saved?‚Äù*
*And they said, ‚ÄúBelieve in the Lord Jesus and you and your household will be saved.‚Äù*

The faith of the head of the family was sufficient to baptize the entire non-Christian household because the entire household is expected to obey and respect the head of the family. Minor children and infants were also included in the baptism because they are under the authority of their parents. Moreover, children were not allowed to choose a different faith than their parents.

On the other hand, if we are disturbed with the behaviour of any of our family members, God is well aware of what is happening but He will not intervene to bring peace into our homes because He is waiting for us to repent and change ourselves.

If we repent with godly repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10) and lead holy lives, our fallen-away family members can eventually be saved.

God allowed the violent earthquake and whatever happened at the prison on that day because He wanted the jailer and his household to be converted.

The apostles converted the entire households of many Jews and gentiles in the first century AD because one member accepted Jesus and the rest of their families followed in their footsteps.

Therefore, instead of wasting our time trying to change our difficult spouse, our rebellious children, our nagging in-laws, etc., let us first examine ourselves and check if we have been obedient to the Lord in all we do and say. And let us be thankful to God in every situation, positive or negative, even though we cannot see any good in the negatives.

1 Corinthians 13:1-3
*If I speak in the tongues of mortals and of angels, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.*
*And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I hand over my body to be burnt so that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.*

Speaking in tongues, prophetic powers, faith in Christ, knowledge of scriptures, donating all our possessions, martyrdom, etc., are all good, but if we hate or dislike even one human, living or dead, then we are not in a state of grace and everything else we do is in vain.

The new law is a law of pure, unconditional, sacrificial love, written on our hearts, and must be put into practice. It is not meant just to be kept in our memories or on our tongues.

If we cannot love everyone 100 percent and if we cannot help those in need then we have disobeyed the new Commandment and our worship is all false.

True faith in God combined with true love of neighbor produces good works of mercy just as a good tree produces good fruits (Matthew 21:18-22).

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

##### Day 337 Love never fails

The gifts of the Holy Spirit are not sanctifying gifts, they are for the common good of the Church. Of course, they can aid in our sanctification if we cooperate with God‚Äôs will. But the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not the yardstick, the fruits of the Holy Spirit are what we should look for.
If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.
2And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. 1 Cor 13:1-2

So if someone has all the gifts and no fruits they are a noisy cymbal. All the gifts of the Holy Spirit should operate out of love. Love in our modern-day standards is stripped of its true meaning. The true meaning of love is stated in Corinthians.
Love is patient,
Love is kind.
Love is not jealous,
Love is not pompous, it is not inflated,
Love is not rude,
Love does not seek its own interests
Love is not quick-tempered
Love does not brood over injury,
Love does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. 1 Cor 13:4-8

The best way to judge a person is not with the gifts but by the fruits. We should see if the person is patient, kind, not proud, not jealous, not rude or quick-tempered, does not brood over injury or hold a record of wrongs. The person can bear all things, believe and hope for all things and endures all things.
We need to grow and develop the fruits of the Spirit, cooperate with God‚Äôs grace and develop fruit. That is why St Paul said that Love will never fail, everything else will be pass away.

If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.
9For we know partially and we prophesy partially,
10but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love. 1 Cor 13:8-10, 13.

So let us strive for the gifts of the Holy Spirit, so we can serve the church and also edify our spiritual lives. But our focus should be on our relationship with the Lord. We should grow in the fruits of the Holy Spirit because only the fruit last the gifts will cease.

Let us grow in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Gal 5:22,23

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Death Defeated

[![Death Defeated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day338.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hOyFIABD9IY "Death Defeated")

##### Day 338 O death where your is your sting

All the advancement in science and technology has not allowed anyone to live forever. Death can be extended but never overcome.
None of the gods in this world can say they have overcome death or are able to rise again from the dead. Thanks be to God Jesus died and rose again, He now gives us eternal life.

‚ÄúDeath is swallowed up in victory.
55Where, O death, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?‚Äù
56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
57But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Cor 15: 54-57

We have nothing to fear as the worst thing that can happen to anyone death, has been conquered by Jesus Christ. We have victory through Christ, we have life eternal, after we died we live forever. We just transition from earthly life to eternal heavenly life.

Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,
52in an instant, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
53For that which is corruptible must clothe itself with incorruptibility, and that which is mortal must clothe itself with immortality. 1 Cor 15:51-53

On our own we are not holy enough to enter into God‚Äôs presence, we are mortal and corrupt. But when we put on Christ, the immortal and incorruptibility we are made perfect and holy so we can enter into the presence of God.
Some of us have a lifetime to prepare and some will not, so we are to always be ready for the Lord. The seasons of the church, Advent and Lent are perfect times to reset and reevaluate our lives. Everything corrupt needs to be clothed with Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 339 Living as a loving community

Many people stay away from church because of a bad experience with other folks at church. People are hurt intentionally or unintentionally, and people feel excluded or unworthy. Let us try to overcome all of these and come together as a loving community for Christ.

Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
Your every act should be done with love.
I rejoice in the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they made up for your absence,
18for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So give recognition to such people.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1 Cor 20: 13,14,17,18,20

St Paul encourages us to be on our guard and to stand firm in our faith, to be courageous and strong, and do everything out of love. We have to be strong both inside and outside the church, we should stand firm when someone tries to push us around, our faith should overcome any fear or overpower any negativity. We should do everything out of love, remember love is patient, kind, enduring, does not hold grudges, not proud or rude. We are called to be a good example in the church, and exhibit love where there seems to be a lack of love.

We should also love the Lord above everything else.
If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Marana tha. 1 Cor 12:3

St Paul seems to be coming off to strong here when we said if anyone does not love the Lord let him be accursed. But a deeper understanding of the word can help.

Accursed: literally, ‚Äúanathema.‚Äù This expression (cf. 1 Cor 12:3) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in preparation for the Lord‚Äôs coming and judgment

During the season of Advent don‚Äôt we pray Maranatha?

Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the early Christian liturgy. As understood here (‚ÄúO Lord, come!‚Äù), it is a prayer for the early return of Christ.
Come Lord Jesus Come.

##### The Power of the Holy Spirit

[![The Power of the Holy Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day340.jpg)](https://youtu.be/S66B7h4dObE "The Power of the Holy Spirit")

##### Day 340 A true Christian life should have a personal relationship with Jesus and be led by the Holy Spirit.

Many people complain that faith and religion are boring and that they get nothing out of church. Sunday Mass becomes another weekend chore like grocery shopping. We may be missing one of these two important parts of our faith.
We see how the evil spirit tossed up the sons of Sceva, because they did not have a personal relationship with Jesus.

Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those with evil spirits, saying, ‚ÄúI adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.‚Äù
14When the seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, tried to do this,
15the evil spirit said to them in reply, ‚ÄúJesus I recognize, Paul I know, but who are you?‚Äù
16The person with the evil spirit then sprang at them and subdued them all. He so overpowered them that they fled naked and wounded from that house.
We cannot live our faith lives with textbook knowledge of Jesus, we need to have a loving and living relationship with Jesus. We cannot just claim to know ‚Äúabout‚Äù Jesus but need know him.

‚ÄúYou are one with Jesus as the body is one with the head. You must then have one breath with him, one soul, one life, one will, one mind, one heart, and he must be your breath, heart, love, life, your all.‚Äù‚ÄîSaint John Eudes

The second thing missing in our life may be a relationship with the Holy Spirit. We may be like the Christians in Ephesus who had no clue who the Holy Spirit us.
When I was younger I though the Holy Spirit was just a nice dove that flew around and descended on Jesus at His Baptism. Some people think of the Holy Spirit as a symbol of fire, dove or wind.

He said to them, ‚ÄúDid you receive the holy Spirit when you became believers?‚Äù They answered him, ‚ÄúWe have never even heard that there is a holy Spirit.‚Äù
3He said, ‚ÄúHow were you baptized?‚Äù They replied, ‚ÄúWith the baptism of John.‚Äù
4Paul then said, ‚ÄúJohn baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.‚Äù
5When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
6And when Paul laid \[his\] hands on them, the holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.Ep 19:2-6

The Holy Spirit is no simple dove, but the very life support of our souls. The Holy Spirit is our advocate, counselor, helper, teacher, guide and the very help that Jesus promised us. Jesus said it was better that He went away so that the Holy Spirit can be sent. The Holy Spirit gave the fearful disciples courage to come out of hiding and preach the good news ‚Äì without fearing even death.
Let us spend time to speak with Jesus each day and listen to His words, be led by the Holy Spirit and live a love and joy filled life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 340 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 19:5-6
*When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.*
*And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.*

The believers received two Sacraments.
The believers entered the Church with faith. They were then baptized with water (v.5) (Sacrament of Baptism) to wash away all past sins (for adults), including the curse of original sin (for all), and make them worthy of being part of God‚Äôs family, thus enabling them to receive sanctifying graces and take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion). Thereafter Paul (the Apostle/Bishop) confirmed them by laying his hands upon them (v.6) to receive the Holy Spirit (Sacrament of Confirmation).
When we receive the first Sacrament (water baptism) the Holy Spirit baptizes us into Jesus (1 Corinthians 12:13) but when we receive the second Sacrament (Confirmation) Jesus baptizes us with the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 2:4).
Through Baptism we receive the life of the Trinity and through Confirmation we receive the mission of the Trinity.

Acts 19:11-12
*So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God accomplished at the hands of Paul that when face cloths or aprons that touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.*
God heals people even through material things or through dead bodies just as God heals our bodies through the doctors, and heals our souls through the priests; and just as God sanctifies us through water (baptism), and anoints us through oil, etc.
When the dead body of a Moabite touched Elisha‚Äôs dead body the Moabite became alive (2 Kings 13:20-21).
People were healed when they touched the fringe of the garment of Jesus (Mathew 14:35-36; Mark 5:28-29).
God uses people and material things to heal people because He wants us to remain in communication with each other to build a family relation.

Acts 19:13-16
*Then some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, ‚ÄúI adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims.‚Äù Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. But the evil spirit said to them in reply, ‚ÄúJesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?‚Äù Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered them all, and so overpowered them that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.*
Exorcism in the name of Jesus cannot be performed without faith in Jesus.
Exorcism performed without the name of Jesus would be demonic.
Exorcism performed without being in a state of grace can be dangerous for the exorcist.

The authority to exorcise demons was given by Jesus only to the 12 apostles. He didn't give the authority to His other disciples.
Exorcising demons is not something that anyone can do. To be a successful exorcist it is very important that a man has to be an ordained priest living in a state of grace otherwise it can prove to be disastrous or even fatal for him.

##### Day 341 We walk by faith, not by sight.

The Christian life is a life of dependence on God, we may not know God‚Äôs plan for us but we trust Him fully. We do not go by what we see but walk by faith, knowing that the God who created us will take care of us. We may feel abandoned or alone on this journey especially when we are going through the trials of life. Let us rest assured that Jesus is walking with us and is carrying us.

‚ÄúWe walk by faith, not by sight.‚Äù 2corinthians 5:5
We will face many challenges in life, we may feel as though we are crushed but we will rise again in the strength of the Lord.
We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
9persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;
2 Cor 4:8-9

Although we may seem persecuted, afflicted and struck down, we should have faith and we God will make a way out for us. We will never be constrained or driven to despair or destroyed. We will rise up with wings as eagles and our strength will be renewed. The Lord Himself will hold our hands and lift us up. When we are weak He is strong.
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.

11For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. 2 Cor 4:10-11

When we suffer, we suffer with Christ, He is the head and we are the body. But our suffering will bring new life in heaven. Our suffering takes on a new meaning when we unite our suffering with Christ's suffering for the salvation of the world.
knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence. 2 Cor 4: 14

Our suffering will not be in vain the Holy Spirit will raise us up into the presence of Jesus.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Generous Hearts

##### Day 342 The real struggles of being a disciple of Christ.

When we read about the great miracles performed by the early disciples we can assume that they were able to do anything. But the disciples had real problems and suffering. They needed to be strong and endure the hardships that came their way.

We cause no one to stumble in anything, in order that no fault may be found with our ministry;
4 on the contrary, in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God, through much endurance, in afflictions, hardships, constraints,
5beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts;
6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in a holy spirit, in unfeigned love,
7in truthful speech, in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness at the right and at the left;
8through glory and dishonor, insult and praise. We are treated as deceivers and yet are truthful;
9as unrecognized and yet acknowledged; as dying and behold we live; as chastised and yet not put to death;
10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things. 2 Cor 6:3-10

The disciples had to endure so many hardships as listed above, that they were beaten and not respected. They were proclaiming the truth but were considered deceivers. They were chastised and put to death because they decided to preach Christ.
In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the church of their many sins. He prayed and hoped that they would change their lives for the Lord.
For even if I saddened you by my letter, I do not regret it; and if I did regret it (\[for\] I see that that letter saddened you, if only for a while),
9I rejoice now, not because you were saddened, but because you were saddened into repentance; for you were saddened in a godly way, so that you did not suffer loss in anything because of us.

10For godly sorrow produces a salutary repentance without regret, but worldly sorrow produces death. 2 Cor 7:8-10

Paul‚Äôs suffering and struggle did not go in vain, his first letter bore good fruit. The church in Corinth repented and there is great rejoining in heaven when anyone repents.
Sometimes as parents or leaders, we should not hesitate to correct those in our care. We are responsible for their spiritual lives, we should tell people that they are wrong when needed.
Let us pray for all teachings, leaders, priests, parents, elders, or anyone in authority.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 342 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 21:13
*Then Paul replied, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? I am prepared not only to be bound but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.‚Äù*

The man who once took the life of a Christian because of his faith (Acts 7:58) was now ready to give his own life for the same faith. One act of mercy from Stephen changed the life of Paul forever and brought thousands into the Church.
Paul's conversion should give us hope that if we forgive our persecutors and pray for them, it is possible that they will repent and accept Christ some day.
However sinful a person may be, God can convert anyone anytime and use them for His glory.

Therefore, while we make sure to pray for our brothers and sisters who are victims of persecution, let us not forget to pray for the conversion of the persecutors.

2 Corinthians 6:2
*For he says: ‚ÄúIn an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.‚Äù Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.*
For us, the day of salvation is not what happened 2000 years ago. For us, the day of salvation is "today" because we are members of the Body of Christ.
We ask the Lord to give us our new Manna "today" (Matthew 6:11) so that we can consume it ‚Äútoday‚Äù because if we keep it for the next day it will rot (Exodus 16:19-20).
We are building bridges, not walls.

2 Corinthians 6:16‚Äì18
*We are the temple of the living God; as God said, ‚ÄúI will live in them and move among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Therefore, come out from them, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch nothing unclean; then I will welcome you, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters.‚Äù*

This promise was made to the Israelites (Leviticus 26:11-12; Ezekiel 20:41) but now it is only for the Christians (Jewish and non-Jewish).

When we receive the Body of Christ (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) we receive divine life and thus we become temples of the living God because God will live in us until we commit a mortal sin.

2 Corinthians 7:10
*For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.*
True godly sorrow is sorrow over having wounded and broken God‚Äôs heart with our sins. The Holy Spirit will bring out that sorrow. We cannot truly repent without the Holy Spirit convicting us of our sin.

Trying to appear repentant and sorrowful to escape the consequences of our wrong doings in this world, after being caught, is not true repentance.
Repenting and confessing sins without the feeling of guilt, just to keep out of Hell, is also not true repentance.
Those are all types of worldly sorrow.

When we realize just how much God loves us, and when we feel the pain that Jesus felt during His passion for our sins, the Holy Spirit will make that awareness come to us and cause us to grieve. It is more like a rebellious young man in a prison cell reflecting on how he hurt and disgraced his parents and siblings by committing a crime; that is godly sorrow. It is the sorrow that comes from our heart.

2 Corinthians 8:9
*For you know the generous act of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.*
Jesus was rich when He was divine but He became a poor human so that by receiving Him into our bodies in a state of grace we can share in His divine nature. In other words, Jesus in His generosity gave up His divinity to make us spiritually rich.
Likewise, in imitation of Christ, we too must give up all our earthly comfort and luxury and lead simple lives so that we can give our excess to the poor to help raise them up to our level (Acts 4:34-35).

Thus we can gradually erase poverty with our generosity.

##### Day 343 Boast in our weakness

St Paul went through many trails and hardships as he persistently preached Jesus.
I am still more, with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, far worse beatings, and numerous brushes with death.

24Five times at the hands of the Jews I received forty lashes minus one.
25Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I passed a night and a day on the deep;
26on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own race, dangers from Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers;
27in toil and hardship, through many sleepless nights, through hunger and thirst, through frequent fastings, through cold and exposure.
28And apart from these things, there is the daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all the churches. 1 Cor 11:23-28

St Paul was beaten, stoned, shipwrecked, exposed to the dangers of elements, robbers, wilderness, sea, fasting, hunger and most hard of all daily pressure and anxiety for all the churches. Instead of running away from suffering, Paul decided to boast in them, boast in his weakness.
‚ÄúIf I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness‚Äù 2 Cor 11:30.

As a spiritual exercise let us try to reflect on two things.

1. What suffering am I willing to go through for the sake of the Kingdom?
2. What do I boast in, my strengths or my weaknesses.

In our weakness, we are strong, because God's power is made perfect in out weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 343 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 22:30
God could have definitely freed Paul but it was not His Will at that moment because it would not accomplish God's salvation plan.

If we are going through some problem or sickness or suffering, there is no harm in asking God to free us from the problem or sickness or suffering but until the solution comes we must continue focusing on God's Will because that may have been God's way of leading us on His path.

2 Corinthians 9:7
*Each of you must give as you have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.*
The sheep received their heavenly reward because they were charitable and the goats were condemned.
Paul was teaching the people how important it was to be charitable.

2 Corinthians 10:12
*We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they do not show good sense.*
False prophets equal themselves to eloquent speakers to prove that they are the true prophets.

2 Corinthians 11:4
*For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough.*
The false prophets may have been teaching one or more of the below heresies which had already started spreading during the first century AD:

1. Jesus was not God
2. Jesus was not man,
3. Jesus wasn't crucified,
4. Jesus didn't rise from the dead.
   Paul gave the people a choice. They could either embrace the truth, even if the preacher was not a good speaker, or they could accept an impressive preacher who tickled their ears with lies.

##### The Thorn in Paul's Side

[![The Thorn in Paul's Side](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day344.jpg)](https://youtu.be/GZadAsEqM8o "The Thorn in Paul's Side")

##### Day 344 My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.

St Paul received great revelation from God, he did not meet the other disciples or learn much from them, we all remember Jesus appeared to him during his conversion when he was struck down from the horse. It seems he was receiving all this doctrine supernaturally.

Therefore, that I might not become too elated, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated.

Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me,
9 but he said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me.
10Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Cor 12:8-10

St Paul was given a thorn in his flesh, we can only speculate if it was a sin, sickness or disability. Or probably the inability to speak well in public or his poor eyesight. Whatever it was it really troubled him, Paul begged God to take it away 3 times, here 3 times is not literally 3 times it must have been more than three. 3 is a complete number symbolizing the trinity ‚Äì so St Paul really prayed through and prayed completely for this thorn to be removed.

God did not answer him positively but gave him a better solution. The solution was God himself, it was not by our holiness but by God‚Äôs power that our weakness is made strong. We are made perfect in Christ. God‚Äôs grace is sufficient for us, whatever is lacking in us is filled by God‚Äôs love.
God was saving Paul from the greatest sin of all, the sin of Pride. That is why the thorn was permitted in Paul‚Äôs life.

So when you struggle with habitual sin or a chronic condition and wonder why God does not deliver you from it, maybe it‚Äôs God‚Äôs way of keeping us close to Him. Whenever you find yourself lacking or weak run to Jesus in the sacrament of Reconciliation and the Eucharist. God‚Äôs grace is sufficient for us, power is made perfect in weakness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 344 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 23:6-11
Paul was aware of the mixed crowd in front of him and therefore used his wisdom to create a situation which would force the Sanhedrin to transfer him to Rome, where he wanted to take the Gospel because Rome was the center of the world during those days. He distracted them with his statement and pitted them against each other, causing an uproar in the House so that he would be removed from the trial.

2 Corinthians 12:7-10
*Therefore, that I might not become too elated because of the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, to beat me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I begged the Lord about this, that it might leave me, but he said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me. Therefore, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and constraints, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.*

The thorn in the flesh may have been an adversary of Paul who was making his life miserable, or it may have been a wound that hurt him real bad, like a throbbing pain, so he begged the Lord to take away his suffering.

Like Jesus in the garden of Gethsemene, three times Paul begged Jesus to spare him of the suffering but the answer was "no," therefore Paul accepted the suffering as God's Will. The healing was withheld for a higher purpose.

When God chooses people for His mission, He will break them with sufferings (sickness, insults, humiliation, rejection, problems, etc.) so that when people see the positive results inspite of the suffering they will believe that it is because of the power of God working in those chosen people and not because of their expertise. The suffering is also meant to humble the chosen ones so that they may not boast about their achievements.

When Paul spoke of his credentials he did not refer to the degrees or certificates which he had acquired from learning under the guidance of the famous Rabbi. Rather he spoke of his sufferings (2 Corinthians 11:23-28) because, by being patient and resigned during his sufferings for the sake of Christ he had allowed Christ to suffer through him and thus made Christ victorious in bringing salvation to others.

Paul clearly understood his mission as a follower of Christ and was faithful to his mission.
If we have not understood our mission as Christians then let us ask the Lord to help us understand His Will for us.

2 Corinthians 12:12
*The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, signs and wonders and mighty works.*
The proof of a prophet or apostle chosen by God is seen in the miracles which the prophet or apostle  works.

##### Day 345 Just being a good person is not our Christian calling.

"I have been crucified with Christ; yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me"

Many people try to justify not going to Church by saying ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a good person‚Äù. They are trying to justify themselves by following the law, not the Jewish law but their own law. People make up their own rules or follow the moral rules of natural law and think they will get to heaven. Heaven is described as a place where God is present and if people don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with God on earth then there is no point in going to heaven to be with God forever.

who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.Gal 2:16

We are not saved by works, so just doing good works will not get us to heaven. If we could be saved by being a good person then there was no need for Jesus to die for us.
If we are satisfied by just being a good person we fall into the trap of being perfect and not needing a savior, because we have already achieved what is good.
We are to have faith in Christ, we need to die to ourselves and live in Christ.

For through the law I died to the law, that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ;
20yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.
21I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.Gal 2: 19-21

Living a life united with Christ on earth will get us to heaven. When goodness itself lives in our heart, we radiate the love of Christ to this dark world.
It is no longer about me, it‚Äôs about Christ present in my heart. My hands are not mine anymore but Christ‚Äôs hands which love the poor and weak. My feet are not mine but Christ‚Äôs which are feet that bring good news to the world.
I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

Galatians 1:6-12
The false Gospel which Paul was referring to was the teaching which some people were spreading among the gentiles that accepting the Gospel and being baptized was fine, but if they truly wanted to be saved then, in addition, it was also necessary that they must be circumcised and they must follow the Mosaic Law.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

Jesus had given the Apostles the authority to bind and loose (Matthew 16:19; and 18:18). By this authority, when Paul declared an anathema on those who pervert the Gospel, anathema was already declared in Heaven.

We must follow the Gospel which the Apostles have given us, not a Gospel that teaches us different, or a Gospel that has been modified. In other words, if we depart from the Liturgy of the Church, we depart from Christ.

Galatians 2:10
Peter, James and John emphasized to Paul that he must always remember the poor.
From the time the law was first given to God‚Äôs people, God had emphasized that they must always take care of the poor (Deut. 15:11). Jesus also reminded us of the same (Matthew 9:13; 12:7).
Therefore, reading the Bible every day, praying for long hours, attending worship, etc. are all of no use if we have neglected the poor people around us.

Galatians 2:11-14
Peter was not giving any erroneous doctrinal teaching. Paul opposed him because Peter was not practicing what he was preaching.
Spiritual leaders are sinners like us and are therefore likely to commit sins like us. Peter was trying to save his skin and therefore ended up going against his own teaching. In such cases they must be open to correction from their subordinates.

Galatians 2:16
*We, who are Jews by nature and not sinners from among the Gentiles, yet who know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.*

Paul was clearing the confusion among the Jews who had been baptized, that they had not received their hope for salvation because they were obedient to the Law of Moses, but that the gates of heaven had been opened for them because of God's grace.

We are not justified by works of the Mosaic Law or works that are not done for Christ. The Mosaic Law was given to the people to discipline them and to live holy lives. The Mosaic Law was not good enough to purify a person‚Äôs conscience/soul to receive salvation. Therefore, after the resurrection, we now follow the Law of Christ, not the Law of Moses.

The early Church still being in its infancy, it was normal for the Jewish Christians to face such confusion because they were previously expected to strictly follow the Mosaic Law or else they would be cut out from God‚Äôs family.

Galatians 2:20
*Yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me; insofar as I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who has loved me and given himself up for me.*

Christ lives in us from the time we are baptized, and continues to live in us as long as we are in a state of grace and surrender our will to His Will.

Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was the first Christian in whom Christ lived physically, and the life which she lived in the flesh she lived by faith in the Son of God, her Son, who loved her and gave Himself up for her, as much as He gave Himself up for us.

Let us follow her example and live by true faith in Christ and for Christ so that Christ can live in us always.

Galatians 3:1-14
Paul was not speaking about good works of mercy, or against it. According to the Jews "works of the Law" meant "strictly observing all the ceremonies of the Mosaic Law," example: ritual washing, circumcision, Sabbath, kosher diet, etc. Paul was explaining to the Galatians that by observing those ceremonies they would never be able to save their souls because those were only shadows of the reality of the Christian faith. They can be saved by faith in Jesus and by obeying all the commandments.

##### Fruits of the Spirit

[![Fruits of the Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day346.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ai-TYQfqfJo "Fruits of the Spirit")

##### Day 346 The Fruit of the Spirit

Just as a tree is known by its fruit, a disciple of Jesus is known by their fruits.

In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.Gal 5:22-23

We could spend hours going over each of these fruits and we should ponder on each of these each day. We can use the fruits of the Spirit to examine our conscience every night, check if we loved enough, had joy in our trials, keep the peace, were kind to strangers, generous to those in need, faithful to God, family and friends, did we have self-control on our senses? I‚Äôm sure we all will feel that we are lacking in some area or the other.
So how do we grow more fruit? The answer is simple we need to nourish the tree. We nourish ourselves with the Sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist, we prune dead branches at the sacrament of reconciliation. The trees need the sun to live so do we, we need the ‚ÄúSon‚Äù to live. Personal prayer and Bible reading are a critical part of our nourishment as well. Also trees stay together in a forest so they can withstand gusty winds and other elements, we likewise need the love of a community to grown and be strong.
Most important thing for a tree is water, we need the living waters ‚Äì the Holy Spirit to thrive.

For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want. But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Gal 5:17-18

If we want to bear fruit we need to be guided by the Holy Spirit, we just cannot do what the flesh desires. The desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit. The works of the flesh can drag us down and stunt our growth.

Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,
20idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions,
21occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. Gal 5:19-21

Let us steer clear of the above traps of the flesh and be led by the Holy Spirit. If we can focus on leading a holy life, a life led and guided by the Holy Spirit the fruit of the Spirit will automatically grow and people will take joy in our presence. People will be drawn to us when they see the love, joy, peace, patience‚Ä¶..

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### Day 347 Promises & Blessings from Ephesians 1

Sometime the best thing to do is read and ponder on the Bible. Let us do just that as we read the promises and blessings from Ephesians 1.

4 God choose us in Christ before the creation of the world

5 From Eternity he destined us in love to be his adopted sons and daughters in Christ

7 in Christ we obtain freedom, sealed by His blood
have forgiveness of sins greatness of his grace he lavishes on us

14 We were sealed by the Holy Spirit

17 May God reveal himself to you & give you a spirit of wisdom & revelation

18 May he enlighten your inner vision
May we know how great the inheritance, the glory, God sets apart for us

19 May we understand with what extraordinary power he acts in favor of us who believe

20 Jesus Christ is above all rule, power, authority, dominion or any supernatural force that could be named

22 God put all things under his feet, Christ is the head we are the body.

Let us Pray: Lord Jesus, reveal your self to me and may I experience the greatness of your grace. Thank you for working in my favor with extraordinary power. I submit my life at your feet Lord, lead me Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Acts 26:14
*"It hurts you to kick against the goads (spikes)."*

This is a Greek proverb about useless and harmful resistance, well understood by the farmers. Stubborn yoked oxen that kick against the plowman will only hurt themselves on the goads (sharp spikes) behind them.

Jesus had told Paul that Paul‚Äôs resistance to the Gospel was futile to the point of being personally harmed.

This is true, not only for Paul, but for every human, Christian and non-Christian.
It is possible that a Christian can reject the Gospel some time after he is baptized, if he desires to follow another faith, either because he is threatened or offered some benefits or for any other reason.

Acts 26:32
*And Agrippa said to Festus, ‚ÄúThis man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.‚Äù*

Paul appealed to the emperor (Caesar), not because he wanted to be set free but because he had a strong desire to preach the Gospel to Caesar (Acts 28:xxxxx).
Do we have that kind of passion to spread the Gospel even when times are bad for us?

##### Day 348 Put on the armor of God

To live as a true Christian means to live in a war zone on earth. The world around us is not a perfect place to live in, there are many distractions, temptations, anxieties, and opposition. The world values are opposed to the Kingdom's values and principles. We sometimes overlook the fact that the devil and his fallen angels are constantly at war against us trying to rob, steal, and destroy our souls.
For our struggle is not with flesh and blood but with the principalities, with the powers, with the world rulers of this present darkness, with the evil spirits in the heavens Ep 6:12

We need to draw strength from the Lord who is all-powerful and the enemy stands defeated in His Mighty and Matchless name, the name of Jesus.
Finally, draw your strength from the Lord and from his mighty power. Ep 6:10

We need to guard ourselves against the contact attack we are under, the way to do that is to put on the whole armor of God. In fact, it is stated twice to put on the armor of God. When things are important they are mentioned twice. Just like Jesus said ‚Äútruly truly I say to you‚Äù
Put on the armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the tactics of the devil. Ep 6:11

Therefore, put on the armor of God, that you may be able to resist on the evil day and, having done everything, to hold your ground. Ep 6:13
The armor of God is compared to a soldier‚Äôs armor, because we are in the battlefield.
So stand fast with your loins girded in truth, clothed with righteousness as a breastplate,
15and your feet shod in readiness for the gospel of peace.
16In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all \[the\] flaming arrows of the evil one.
17And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Ep 6:14-17

¬∑ Belt of Truth
¬∑ Breastplate of righteousness
¬∑ Shoes of Peace
¬∑ Shield of Faith
¬∑ Helmet of Salvation
¬∑ Sword of the Spirit ‚Äì the word of God

BELT OF TRUTH
As a Christian we know that the truth sets us free, so we always have to secure our lives in the truth. Just as the belt holds our cloths secure and prevents us from disgrace, so does truth. My mom always said ‚Äì ‚Äúif you tell one lie, you will need to tell 10 more lies to cover that up.‚Äù We have to hold firm to the truth of the Gospel and the truth about ourselves.

BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
None our us can claim to be righteous except through the righteousness we receive from Christ. We should always stay in a state of grace, going to confession if we have any mortal sin on our hearts. Going to regular Mass helps wash away the venial sins.

SHOES OF PEACE
Blessed are the feet that bring good news to the world. We are called to be peacemakers and ones who will bring people together. We are called to go out to the ends of the earth to proclaim God‚Äôs word. Wearing shoes means ready and willing to go out as the Holy Spirit leads.
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns!‚Äù Is 52:7

SHIELD OF FAITH
In all circumstances we should hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one. The evil one will shoot arrows of doubt, negativity, lies, confusion, envy, jealously, anger‚Ä¶ we are to hold up the shield of Faith, knowing that God will take care of us. Holding up the shield of faith means knowing that God is on our side and no weapon formed against us will prosper.

HELMET OF SALVATION
Knowing that Jesus has saved us from death and that He will give us eternal life should always be on our minds. If you struggle with suicidal thoughts or depression, guard your mind with the Helmet of Salvation.
SWORD OF THE SPIRIT ‚Äì THE WORD OF GOD
Imagine a soldier in a battle without his sword. The enemy will keep on attacking until the armor is broken. That is the case with many Christians today, they do not know the word of God. ‚ÄúMy people are destroyed for lack of knowledge‚Äù So rightly said in Hosea we are unable to stand up against the devil because we do not know the Word of God. Remember Jesus in the desert fought off the devil with the Word of God. The Sword is the only offensive weapon we have, and so is the Word of God, it is sharper than any two-edged sword. If you want to live a victorious life, read scripture and memorize it. The Holy Spirit will bring to you the right scripture in battle.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 348 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 27:17
*They hoisted it aboard, then used cables to undergird the ship. Because of their fear that they would run aground on the shoal of Syrtis, they lowered the drift anchor and were carried along in this way.*

The sailors were afraid of being driven across to the quicksands of the African coast, so they lowered the topsails and were thus driven before the wind.
The ship that Paul was sailing on encountered a huge storm with hurricane force winds. For fourteen days they didn‚Äôt see the sun or the stars. The sailors tried their best to steer the ship, did everything they could to keep control, but the winds were too strong. Therefore, instead of fighting it and trying to force where they wanted the ship to go, they took down the sails and let the wind drive them.

Are we trying to control everything and getting upset because it‚Äôs not happening according to our way? Are we trying to force things to happen our way?

When we have done everything we can ‚Äîwe have prayed, we have believed, we have stood in faith‚Äîthere comes a time when we have to do like the sailors did: Quit fighting it, quit trying to force it to work out, quit losing sleep, and release control of it into God‚Äôs hands. Then rest in faith and trust Him. God will take the same winds that were meant to stop us and shift them to blow us forward according to His plan.

Acts 27:33-38
After breaking bread (‚Äúartos‚Äù in Greek) (v. 27:35), Paul did not distribute it as is the normal procedure. Paul celebrated the new Passover (Mass) and consumed the Body of Christ (Holy Eucharist) himself, while the other people in the boat ate normal food (‚Äútrapheh‚Äù in Greek) (v. 27:34 & 36), probably because they were not baptized people.

Ephesians 4:7 and 11-13
*But each of us was given grace according to the measure of Christ‚Äôs gift. The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until all of us come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ.*

The duty of the people in authority in the Church is not only to spread the Gospel but also to train their subordinates to spread the Gospel. And the role of the subordinates in the Church is not a passive role of just listening to the Word of God, but, along with the people in authority, the subordinates must also play an active role in the Church by assisting in spreading the Gospel.

Ephesians 4:26
*Be angry but don't sin.*

When we are offended by others or when we see the wicked ones harming the innocent ones, it is understandable that such behavior makes us angry. But, in our anger, when we go one step further to retaliate, then we are no different than those sinners.

Creating a negative situation is the devil's way of dragging the good ones on his path.
God allows that to happen as a test for us and also so that we can bring those negative people close to Him with our patience, prayers and forgiveness.
When we face such situations let us remember that when Jesus was attacked physically and verbally, He did not retaliate. Instead, He patiently bore the pain of the extreme torture and forgave them.

Ephesians 5:1-20
If a man uses his neighbors or friends to help him daily with his work, he will pay them at the end of the day or the month and send them home, but he will not give a share of his inheritance for his neighbors or friends. His inheritance will always be for his obedient children, not even for his rebellious ones. The rebellious ones may end up in prison for life.

Similarly, since God is a Holy Father, He may use many people to do His kingdom work on earth but His inheritance will only be for His obedient children. The rebellious ones may end up in prison (Hell) for life.

Paul therefore warns us to beware of unholy life. We must avoid sinful thoughts, sinful words and sinful deeds. God‚Äôs children belong to Heaven and must therefore not allow anger, hatred, revenge, greed, selfishness, lies, disobedience, etc., etc. to enter their hearts (Ephesians 4:31-32). Alcohol must be consumed within limits so that they don‚Äôt get drunk or else the evil spirit will start controlling them. We must lead holy lives so that we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us always (v.18).

We are called to be like God by practicing our virtues. We must therefore be kind, loving, generous, forgiving, etc.

Ephesians 5:1
*Be imitators of God, as beloved children.*

Paul was not asking us to divinize ourselves.

We have been created in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27), therefore we have the ability to be loving, forgiving, generous, kind, patient, understanding, etc. and we can imitate God by practicing these virtues. This means that we must always remain in a Covenant relation with God, not with Satan. We can go a long way by doing little acts of love and forgiveness, little acts of generosity and kindness, etc. both in and out of our homes.

God is love, and those who live in love live in God, and God lives in them (1 John 4:16). God's Covenant love is free, faithful, total and fruitful.

If we say that we have surrendered ourselves to Christ, then we must love everyone around us unconditionally like Christ, and we must also be ready to suffer like Christ, because there is no true love without suffering.

Ephesians 5:3-7
When our faith is weak, we must not associate ourselves with people who take us away from God. Instead, we must strengthen our faith and do our best to bring others closer to God by the way we live, speak and interact with others.
Idolatry is not just about worshipping statues of creation. Idolatry is also about spending more time with creation than required and less time with God.
Example: working extra hours, spending too much time with social media, entertainment (movies, TV shows, sports, etc.), etc.

Ephesians 5:8-14
Paul was addressing the Ephesians who were pagans before they came into the Church. They were probably not aware of what was good and what was bad because in paganism it was normal to accept certain practices which were abhorrent to God, such as abuse of women and children, idolatry, immorality, etc.
Christians must therefore, not only avoid doing those evils but they must also avoid speaking about them.

Ephesians 5:14-16
*Awake, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

Paul wants us to wake up from the sinful world, stay away from it and try to do everything that pleases God. We do not know when our time on earth will end therefore we must spend our earthly life in making wise decisions that will help us to come closer to God by the way we live and by the way we act.

Ephesians 5:15-16
*Be careful then how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil.*

We must use our time to do God's Will and try to accomplish God's mission, as if we are going to die tomorrow. We must try to do whatever is possible when we are alive. We must not use our time to get involved with worldly things.

Ephesians 5:18-20
*Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.*

God gave the Israelites a land which was rich in grapes (Numbers 13:23), because wine was to be used in the daily offerings during the Liturgical services, in the old Covenant (Exodus 29:38-42) as well as in the new Covenant (Matthew 26:27; Revelation 6:6).

Therefore Paul does not say "don't drink wine"; He warns us not to get drunk because excess of anything, other than God, is a sin and the beginning of disaster. Drinking wine is not a sin but if we don‚Äôt have self-control then it is better not to touch wine.

The Ephesians may have had a serious addiction to wine because Paul doesn't speak so strongly to the other Churches about getting drunk. However, Paul's instructions are valid even today. When we consume wine beyond limit it causes evil words to flow out of our mouths, and thus we separate ourselves from God (Proverbs 23:31-35). Instead, Paul wants us to use our tongues to worship God by singing Psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, etc. and engage ourselves with activities that bring us closer to God.

Ephesians 5:21-33
The first level of humility is obedience. The next level is service.
A baptized man is a symbol of Christ (the new Adam) and a baptized woman is a symbol of the Church (the new Eve) (Ephesians 5:23-24).
When a man does not obey God's commandments then he must not have any expectations from his wife because when the head of the family is in a Covenant with Satan then the whole family struggles spiritually.

Marriage with conditions is a contract, not a Covenant and is not from God.
In marriage there is no return policy.
Man and wife must love and serve each other to bring out the best person in the spouse, and not to highlight their spouse‚Äôs weaknesses (Ephesians 5:21). We must allow God to use our spouses to correct us whenever we are wrong. Both man and wife must find ways to serve each other, and not expect to be served.

As the head of the family, a man's mission is to die to himself every day in order to make his wife holy. Whatever he does he must do for his wife and not for himself. The intention is to ensure that with their love and care for each other, no sin enters their home and their lives, so that they will both receive eternal life.

The Holy Family is a great example for us. Jesus was the Son of God the Father and Mary was the Mother of God the Son. Joseph was the only ordinary human and the least among the three. But Jesus and Mary did not rule over Joseph. They subjected themselves to Joseph in obedience to his every decision.

Ephesians 6:10-20
In Ephesians 5 Paul just finished giving us advice on how to live a holy family life, by loving each other with sacrificial love; love between man and wife, between parents and children, between masters and slaves.
But in Ephesians 6 Paul starts speaking of spiritual warfare.
The greatest battle field we have to stand on in life is the battle field of our own homes. Jesus commanded us to carry our crosses faithfully every day (Luke 9:23) but the most difficult crosses which we have to carry may be in our own homes. We may, therefore, sometimes find it more easier to practice our Christian faith faithfully outside our homes rather than inside.
Marriage was God's plan for bringing forth new life therefore family is what Satan hates because he is the author of death.

Therefore, if we have a difficult or unfaithful spouse, rebellious children, nagging in-laws, etc. let us remember that it is not our family members that are bad but it is Satan using our family members to force us to eat the forbidden fruit through quarrels, misunderstanding, accusations, blaming each other, etc. to drag us into his kingdom along with our families.
Let us, therefore, ensure that we forgive each other as God forgives us, not with sarcastic apologies, but with genuine apologies from the heart.
It is not wrong to put on the full armour of God when we are outside our homes, but God wants us to put on His full armour first in our own homes.
Spiritually healthy families together make a healthy Church.

##### Day 349 Work out your salvation

We are called to work out our salvation, as opposed to a passive I‚Äôll do nothing but God will save me. Being a Christian means striving to be holy and do good works of mercy. Although our holiness will never be enough because of our fallen nature and the corrupt world we live in, God in His Mercy and Grace will purify us and welcome us into heaven.
So then, my beloved, obedient as you have always been, not only when I am present but all the more now when I am absent, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
13For God is the one who, for his good purpose, works in you both to desire and to work. Ph 2:12-13

God is on our side and God works in us with both desire(faith) and works. We need not fear for our God is the almighty one, everything on earth bows down to our God.
Rather, he emptied himself,
taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, even death on a cross.
9Because of this, God greatly exalted him
and bestowed on him the name
that is above every name,
10that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bend,
of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11and every tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father. Ph 2:7-11

Our God is greater than anything we see, feel or experience. Jesus is Lord over all the earth and the heavens. We need not fear anything as long as we are humbly working out our salvation. Jesus will provide and protect us. Just as Paul was protected from the viper bites.
Paul had gathered a bundle of brushwood and was putting it on the fire when a viper, escaping from the heat, fastened on his hand.
4When the natives saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, ‚ÄúThis man must certainly be a murderer; though he escaped the sea, Justice has not let him remain alive.‚Äù
5But he shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.
6They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly to fall down dead but, after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god Acts 28:3-6

Remember Jesus promised that the disciples would pick up snakes with their hands and not be hurt.
‚Äúthey will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.‚Äù Mark 16:18
Let us know that even if we are in a situation where we have a viper in our hands and it bites us, Jesus will protect us. No venom can kill us because Jesus is in our hearts. We need to just trust in Jesus fully as there are bound to be attacks of the evil on our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 349 By Cynthia Dsilva

Philippians 1:6
*I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus.*

In the old Covenant, God's people waited with joyful expectation for the first coming of the Lord. But in the new Covenant, most of God‚Äôs people are scared or anxious when they think of the second coming of the Lord and the final judgment, because they are not really sure if they are leading their lives according to God's Will or not and whether they have completed the mission for which they were sent to earth.

Paul was therefore assuring the Philippians, and us, that if we continue growing in holiness as well as working for the growth of God‚Äôs Kingdom, then it is not us working but the work of Christ dwelling in us. Therefore, we don‚Äôt have to be anxious about whether or not we will complete our mission before the Lord‚Äôs parousia, because what Christ started doing in us, He will definitely finish before the last day, and if we are loyal to Him and allow Him to remain in us as long as we live then we will definitely be with him and share in His eternal glory.

Philippians 1:15-18
*Some proclaim Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill. These proclaim Christ out of love, knowing that I have been put here for the defense of the gospel; the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely but intending to increase my suffering in my imprisonment. What does it matter? Just that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice.*

The Philippians did not have good relations with many people in their neighbourhood. Even the two ladies, who were working with Paul to assist him in his preaching, had difficulty agreeing with each other (Philippians 4:2).

Although some were preaching the Gospel in Paul‚Äôs absence, all the preachers were not trying to bring people to God out of love for Christ because they weren't leading holy lives themselves.

Some of the preachers were envious of Paul‚Äôs popularity and leadership role. They started preaching because they wanted to grab Paul‚Äôs position and popularity for themselves while he was in prison.

Some of them were preaching for their own benefit, while some were preaching out of rivalry against each other, etc. There were only a few who were genuinely preaching the Gospel out of love for Christ. But whatever reason the preachers were preaching for, Paul was happy that they were bringing people to God. Regarding their personal character they would have to deal with God directly.
And so it is with us.

When we do good works with ungodly motives, the beneficiary will definitely benefit from it but our heavenly reward will depend on our motive.

Philippians 1:21
*For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain.*

Christian life is a win-win life because life is Christ and death is gain.
If we receive the Body of Christ in a state of grace at all times (1 Corinthians 11:27) then we will have divine life within us, therefore Satan will not have power over our souls, and if we die with divine life within us then Satan will not be able to claim our souls, and our souls will be raised on the last day (John 6:54).

So, whether we are living or dead in this world, it is a win-win situation because our souls will always be in the custody of Christ (John 10:27-28), therefore, we should not be afraid of death.

Paul was anxiously waiting for his natural death so that he could be with Christ for eternity but God wanted him to stay on earth for a while to accomplish the mission assigned to him (Philippians 1:22-24).

Paul and the other Apostles are not the only ones who had a mission to accomplish. Every Christian has a mission to accomplish for the Lord.
Let us therefore ask the Lord, without delay, to help us know what our mission is, so that we can get busy with helping in the growth of God‚Äôs Kingdom as long as we are here on earth while we also maintain our holiness.

Philippians 2:1-8
If we are the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head, then the body must be in sync with the head.

Our body is an analogy for our souls.
If our body does not obey what our head/mind tells us to do, then our body suffers in many ways and we may have to see a doctor for physical treatment. We tell him our symptoms and he prepares/prescribes medicine for us along with some lifestyle changes.

Similarly, if we do not obey what Christ wants us to do, then we suffer in many ways due to our sins and we may have to see a spiritual doctor (the priest) for spiritual treatment. We tell him our symptoms (sins) and he prescribes some lifestyle changes (penance). Thereafter he prepares the medicine (the Body of Christ / Communion) for us, to be consumed regularly.

To begin thinking like Christ, Paul is not asking us to move mountains or build projects. Paul advises us to start with baby steps. He just wants us to do, what we do for others, with love and concern for them, starting with our own families and the people around us, and not by selfishly pursuing our own interests or by looking at others as lower than us.
Additionally, we must read the scriptures every day (the old and the new).
At all times we must humble ourselves and use whatever power or authority we have in our hands, to serve others, just as Christ did.

Unlike the first Adam, who in his pride grasped at being like God without God, the new Adam (Jesus) humbled himself to become a slave, obedient even unto death on the Cross (Romans 5:12‚Äì17). In this He has shown sinners, each one of us, the way back to the Father. We can only come to God to serve in His vineyard (the Church), by having that same attitude as Christ.

Philippians 2:12
*Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.*

Paul was aware that his Baptism was not sufficient for salvation.
Salvation is an ongoing lifetime process.
We were saved when we were baptized, we are saved during our lifetime whenever we receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, and we will eventually be saved if we die in a state of grace.

We must, therefore, be alert to sin at all times and keep ourselves purified as long as we live.

##### Faith and Works

[![Faith and Works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day350.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2lCax3ZsJXk "Faith and Works")

##### Day 350 Doers of the Word, not hearer only.

We are called to be not just hearers of the Word but doers as well.
Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves.

23For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his own face in a mirror.
24He sees himself, then goes off and promptly forgets what he looked like. James 1:23-24

Imagine going in front of the mirror in the morning and not combing your hair, it seems foolish, doesn‚Äôt it. But if we read God‚Äôs Word and commands and do not act upon them then we are fooling ourselves.
In the same way, if we say that we have faith that can move mountains but do not have works to prove it, then our faith is dead.
The formula ‚ÄúBelieve in your heart and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and you will be saved‚Äù is not complete.
Although Faith is necessary but faith alone is not enough, works are needed to demonstrate our faith. We are not hearers only but doers as well. In reality, we are not saved only by faith and works but are saved by grace.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
15If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day,
16and one of you says to them, ‚ÄúGo in peace, keep warm, and eat well,‚Äù but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is it?
17So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead. James 2:14-17

So the next time someone tells you faith only saves, ask them to search the Bible for the words ‚ÄúFaith alone‚Äù the only verse that will come up is James 2:17 which said faith by itself is dead.

It is easy to hear God‚Äôs word and love it, but hard to act on it. We may feel overwhelmed or powerless to be doers of the Word. Let me encourage you and remind you that God empowers us and we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

I have the strength for everything through him who empowers me. Phil 4:13

And we can rest assured that God will supply all our needs in accordance to the glorious riches we have in Christ Jesus.

My God will fully supply whatever you need, in accord with his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. Phil 4:19

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 350 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 1:12-18
God is a Tester, not a Tempter.
God does not tempt us but He does test us by allowing trials and tribulations in our lives.
Temptation is meant to deceive us and lure us into sin, which is the work of the devil, and we can overcome temptations only if our faith, love and trust in God is strong.

*Why is it necessary for God to test us?*
God does not test us for Him to know the result. He already knows the result before we were born. God tests us so that we can be aware of our spiritual weaknesses and so that we can work on improving in those areas. The trials and tribulations (terminal exams) are meant to help us grow stronger in our faith and love and to prepare us spiritually for our final exam before we leave this world.

James 1:19-27
Our inability to listen to others arises from lack of patience. We are always eager to speak; we always try to give suggestions to others even when they don't ask us for it. Sometimes we have selective hearing. We listen only to the part of the conversation where we can give our knowledge, our opinion, our solutions, our judgement or our reply. If something we have heard touches our pride, we choose to activate our anger and thereafter harsh words pour out of our mouth.

James is inviting us to listen attentively to others. This means we must keep our eyes and ears open and maintain our silence, speaking only when it is necessary.

Sometimes we like to talk too much about our own problems, achievements and success but we don't have patience or interest to listen to the problems, achievements or successes of others.

James is advising us to learn to control our tongue, which is the cause of most of our sins, and to focus more on generosity towards the destitute, giving preference to widows and orphans.

James 2:1-9
James addresses one of the major problems in the early Church, which was the issue of discrimination. People were being grouped according to their wealth, possessions, power and status in the secular world. As a result the less fortunate ones were being ignored and treated with disrespect while the successful ones were given more attention and treated with great respect.

As Christians, we must avoid giving importance to people just because they have a higher material value or status in life, because Jesus gave His life for every human, irrespective of their caste, religion, colour, status, power, etc.

Let us therefore check ourselves and see if we too have been making the same mistake as the early Christians did. If we have, then let us change that from today and start giving more attention to the less fortunate ones (the poor, the needy, the old age homes, etc.) while we treat all humans as equals.

James 2:14-17
James was reminding us of the words of Jesus (Matthew 7:24).
Jesus is not happy with only lip service from us. He wants to see our works which prove our words (Matthew 25). We cannot say we love God if we don't love our neighbors or if we ignore our neighbors who are in need of help.

We have been created for a purpose and our mission on earth must begin with faith in Christ. But faith without works is dead faith (James 2:17) because faith without works is only lip service. Our faith must be tested, and we can prove our faith (belief and trust) in God only by our works (Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Revelation 2:23; 14:12; 20:12‚Äì13; 22:12). Part of our mission on earth is to do good works for Christ by doing good works for others, not for ourselves.

*What is ‚Äúworks‚Äù?*
James was speaking about all good works accomplished in Christ.
Loving and trusting God and obeying His commandments, even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations, is called ‚Äúworks.‚Äù

James 2:24
Salvation is not through Faith alone.
We enter the Kingdom of God (the Church) through faith but we will be judged by our works.

Philippians 3:2
*Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh!*

Paul‚Äôs main enemies were the Jewish Christians who refused to accept the decision of the first council in Jerusalem that the gentile converts need not be circumcised. Those Jewish Christian opponents were creating chaos in the Churches by spreading the erroneous message that for a Christian to be saved they must also follow the Mosaic law (circumcision, kosher food, animal sacrifices, etc.).

Philippians 3:4‚Äì11
Before his encounter with Jesus, Paul was puffed up with pride because he was circumcised, he was an Israelite, he belonged to one of the tribes of Israel, he was highly educated in the Mosaic Law under the patronage of the famous Rabbi Gamaliel, and above all, he had zeal for God. Like all Pharisees and Scribes, He believed that he was doing everything that was required to receive eternal life because he obeyed the Mosaic Law word-to-word. But unfortunately there was no feeling in his heart for humans.

Paul was highly educated but he couldn't see the truth. He wanted to eradicate Christianity, not realizing that he was trying to eradicate the only source of eternal life.
Most of the time our education tends to make us aggressive and arrogant if we are not alert to sin and the devil's tricky ways.

After Paul had an encounter with Christ, he later realized that all his earthly achievements were just trash, compared to the glory that Jesus had offered him, even though the road to eternal life was going to be full of rocks and thorns.

After his encounter with Jesus, Paul wanted to forget his past, he wanted to forget Saul and try his best to follow Christ as Paul, not as Saul. It was the risen Christ within him who made it possible for Paul to face the suffering which he went through thereafter.

Like Paul, we too can sometimes swell up with pride because we are more educated than others, or because we are more successful in this life than others. But if there is no God in our hearts and in our homes, and if we have no feelings for others, then all our achievements in this life are of no value in God‚Äôs eyes. God is not interested in our success in this life. God blesses us with earthly success so that we can use it to reach out to the people around us, specially the less fortunate ones.
Following Christ should not be limited to just reading the Bible, attending daily worship / Mass, fasting and praying. Jesus wants us to open our eyes and ears and help the people around us with love, as if they were our close family members, specially the less fortunate ones.

##### Day 351 Words have power

We need to remember that our words have power because we are children of God. God created everything with just a word, ‚Äúlet there be light.‚Äù James reminds us that we who are teachers should realize that we speak God‚Äôs word and hence have to avoid any other bad speech.
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you realize that we will be judged more strictly,
2for we all fall short in many respects. If anyone does not fall short in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle his whole body also. James 3:1,2

There are 3 striking examples given to demonstrate the importance of the good use of the tongue.

1. If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.
2. It is the same with ships: even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot‚Äôs inclination wishes.
3. Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze.
   For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species,
   8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. James 3:3-8

It is very hard as to tame the tongue, we can easily slander, gossip, lie, curse, speak rudely, angry words, insults‚Ä¶ Let us pray for the grace to control our tongue, so we will have the strength to control the whole body.
If we take some time to ponder on our speech we may fell as though we are hugging a cactus. But we have to come to terms with reality and draw near to God, for only with God‚Äôs strength can we control our tongue.

Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds.
9Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.
10Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you. James 4:8-10

As we draw near to God we come to a realization of our sin and want to cleanse our hands, hearts and tongue. If we humble ourselves before the Lord, Jesus will lift us up.
Let all our words be holy and positive, for our words have power. Let us speak blessings on our children everyday. Let praise be on our lips all the days of our life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 351 By Cynthia Dsilva

James 3:1
*Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.*
When we become teachers of the faith it is possible that we can swell up with pride because we may see ourselves as better than those who we teach. As teachers of faith it is important that we ourselves practice what we teach others. We must accept correction from others when we are wrong.

God gave us a tongue to praise and worship Him, not to abuse, curse or speak ill of those who are made in the likeness of God.
Let us learn to use our tongue to praise and worship God and to bring happiness in the lives of others.
Let us not be quick to find fault with others or to make negative comments about them.
Let us learn to use our tongue to speak well of others, to remember their good deeds, and to express gratitude.
Let us learn to use our tongue to ask for forgiveness from those whom we offend and to forgive those who offend us.
Let us pray to God to help us practice self-control and to use our tongue wisely.

James 3:13-18
As James explains, worldly wisdom is reflected in covering up our sins or tactfully justifying ourselves for a wrong or evil action. By justifying our ungodly actions we are actually saying that evil is right.
Worldly wisdom causes us to misuse others, specially the less fortunate ones, for our benefit.
Worldly wisdom causes us to pretend that we are perfect and that we have knowledge of everything. We pretend that we are what we are not. We believe that everything we say and do is right, and we refuse to accept corrections.
Worldly wisdom causes us to work for the devil in the name of God.
Thus worldly wisdom causes us to live spiritually bipolar lives.

James advises us to show godly wisdom through our actions and by living good and honest lives.

James 5:7-10
Patience is a virtue which we must practice because we have to wait for God to answer our prayers. While we practice patience we get spiritually healed.
We must have patience before we draw a negative conclusion about a person or a situation.
We must have patience when dealing with negative people, specially with those who provoke us.

The sibling of patience is time. They collaborate with each other to solve our difficulties or problems and the long wait helps us to understand the situation better.
Let us ask the Lord to give us the grace to be patient at all times, and specially during our difficult times.

James 5:14-15
James was talking about the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick with holy oil.
But James was not introducing this Sacrament as a new procedure.

He was telling the people that they must not let this already existing opportunity go waste.

He was reminding the people to call the Priests when someone was in danger of dying, so that maximum souls could be saved.
The Apostles continued anointing the sick with holy oil, as Jesus had taught them before the Resurrection (Mark 6:13).
Unlike baptism, this anointing must be administered only by a Priest ("Presbyters" in Greek / elders) (James 5:14) for the Sacrament to be effective, that is, for God's grace to flow through it.

James 5:16
*Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.*
Before the Resurrection the people‚Äôs sins were forgiven by God (Jesus) through a Priest (Jesus) (Mathew 9:2-8).
After the Resurrection Jesus commissioned His Apostles/Priests to forgive sins (John 20:21-23), but the grace was given to them only after Pentecost Sunday.

James was not introducing the Sacrament of Reconciliation as a new procedure. He was just reminding the people of what they already knew about but were probably neglecting.

When we confess our sins we are not really sharing our dirty little secrets with God, because He already knows everything we think, say and do, whether good or bad. Instead, we are humbling ourselves before God and opening the door to the healing power of His mercy which He wants to give us but cannot, unless we ask for it through His anointed priest. Confessing our sins to a Priest teaches us to practice humility, which is the virtue that removes Pride, the source of sin.

The words of absolution which come from Jesus through the Priest, are not just the babbling of a clergyman or the performance of a ritual. Those words are more powerful than when God said ‚Äúlet there be light ‚Ä¶.‚Äù (Genesis 1:3), and when Jesus said ‚ÄúLazarus come out‚Äù (John 11:43), because creation and Lazarus were not meant to last forever, but our souls will, when we are spiritually healed.
While we spend so much time and effort to keep our physical bodies clean, let us not forget to give regular attention to our spiritual hygiene also.

Colossians 1:24-27
It was the ancient belief that suffering comes only to sinners so the Colossian Christians could not understand why Paul was going through suffering even though he was an Apostle. Paul was explaining to them why he, and all Christians, must go through suffering.

Paul earlier mentioned that all the fullness of God dwells in Christ bodily (Colossians 1:18-19). If Christ is fully divine then He cannot be lacking in His afflictions or suffering of the Cross.

However, if a sinner's love can cover a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8), then God's infinite love can cover an infinite multitude of sins. Therefore, there cannot be anything lacking in the sacrifice of Christ. And as Paul himself said, the Blood of the Cross had the power to reconcile, not only humanity but, the entire cosmos to God (v. 20).

But Paul was not talking about the suffering of Jesus on the Cross. He was talking about his own participation (v. 24) which was lacking in the suffering of Christ (Matthew 16:24).

On Good Friday Jesus inaugurated His redemptive suffering and afflictions with the intention that it will continue in His mystical Body through us (the Christians on earth) which is His Church so that He could be united with His bride (the Church). Therefore, when we (the Christians) suffer, inspite of leading holy lives, we do not suffer in vain. Rather, we suffer in union with Christ for our own salvation and for the salvation of others.

Let us, therefore, not waste our sufferings by pitying ourselves or complaining or retaliating, etc. Let us suffer willingly while we offer all our sufferings (aches & pains, sickness, financial problems, legal problems, etc.) to Christ as penance for our sins as well as for the sins of our offenders (if any) or the sins of those who we feel are in need of being saved.

##### Day 352 Suffering unjustly

Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and equitable but also to those who are perverse.1 Pet 2:18

Most people are either complaining about work or their boss, mostly for the right reasons. Bosses can be very hard to deal with as some of them are really corrupt, they are seeking their own gain. However, as Christians, we should be subject to them whether they are good or bad. Now does Jesus want us to be always under the yoke of hard work, absolutely not. God will give you the right job and boss to benefit you. We should always pray for our boss and job and do it to the best of our ability, God will bless us and we will find fulfillment for the dignity of work comes from God.

For whenever anyone bears the pain of unjust suffering because of the consciousness of God, that is a grace.

20But what credit is there if you are patient when beaten for doing wrong? But if you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good, this is a grace before God.
21For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps. 1 Pet 2:19-22

If we suffer unjustly because of the consciousness of God we can rest assured we are under grace. God will give us the strength to suffer because Jesus suffered unjustly and set an example for us.
‚ÄúHe committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.‚Äù When he was insulted, he returned no insult; when he suffered, he did not threaten; instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly. 1Pet 2:22-23

So whether we suffer justly or unjustly let us remember to unite our suffering to the suffering of Jesus. When we unite our suffering to Jesus‚Äô suffering our suffering becomes redemptive and we receive a blessing, in fact it is a privilege to suffer unjustly. However if we only suffer unjustly then it may turn to abuse, so we need to make people aware if they treat you poorly. Take a stand for what is right, but also accept your cross until the time it is resolved.

May the Holy Spirit lead üôè

##### BIAY Day 352 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Peter 2:20-25
Circumcision was meant only for the natural male descendants of Abraham but Baptism is meant for everyone, old and young, Jews and gentiles. God wants every human to belong to His family from the 8th day of their birth so that they can be brought into a relationship with Him and thereby start receiving sanctifying graces.

In the old Covenant all male descendants of Abraham had to be circumcised on the 8th day of their birth even though the old Covenant could not sanctify their souls.
But the new Covenant is more powerful than the old one, and therefore Peter extends the invitation for baptism to adults and children alike, so that they can be brought into the new Covenant without delay.

Three thousand were baptized after hearing Peter's sermon because Peter spoke with the power of the Holy Spirit.

*By his stripes we are healed.*

This is known as "vicarious suffering" which means "suffering in place of another."
The Romans usually added lead balls and broken bones on the whips in order to rip off the flesh and cause more bleeding, thus making the wounds look like stripes.

By His life, suffering and death Jesus paid the price for our sins and gave us His Blood to purify our souls and thus we are spiritually and physically healed, but the carrying out of that healing process happens in different ways and at different times.
Original sin is cleansed and we are restored to a state of sanctifying grace through baptism. Our souls are redeemed but our bodies are not. And even our souls are not immediately restored and perfected. The disorder of concupiscence remains, that is, the "fomes peccati" (in Latin) or ‚Äútendency to sin‚Äù that afflicts us until we attain our ultimate goal of final salvation at the end of our lives.

The sanctifying graces which we receive through the sacraments are not only a source of healing and restoration, but they are a summons to spiritual battle. They enter us into our time of testing that will lead us to our full and final redemption, that will include not only the full and final redemption of our souls, but also "the redemption of our bodies" (Romans 8:23), but only if we are faithful unto death (Revelation 2:10).

Why?
That is because our bodies are not redeemed yet in any sense. This is unlike our souls that have already experienced redemption, but are in a process of redemption / salvation / justification that will reach its completion at the end of life.

When God chooses to heal our bodies, whenever we are physically sick, that is also a participation in the healing that came to us through the Cross. But it is temporary and points to the more important healing of the soul, as we see in the case of the paralytic when Jesus healed the soul first and then the body (Matthew 9:2-6). The ultimate and absolute healing of the body comes only at the end of time for all humans, with the exception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who did not need any healing of body and soul.

In other words, it means that the healing is not automatic. The healing medicine was prepared by Jesus, spiritually, when He received all His wounds during His passion and death, and also by the holy life He led, but since the time of the Resurrection it has been made available to us for our healing, first during Baptism and thereafter only when we pray and when we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, during which time physical healing may or may not happen but spiritual healing definitely happens.

Colossians 3:5-10
Old person / old self / old man refers to the first Adam and new person / new self / new man refers to the new Adam (Jesus).
The first Adam's sin caused humanity to receive damaged souls which weakened our conscience and therefore we fall into temptations easily.
The new Adam (Jesus) gave us a renewable Covenant so that we, who are baptized, can renew the Covenant whenever we break it, thereby allowing us to restore the divine life within us which gives us the spiritual strength to resist evil and keeps us ready for eternal life.
Our fallen nature can accept evil without any effort, but to resist evil we need spiritual strength which is powerful and we get that power from the sacraments.

Colossians 3:12-21
Divine authority is reflected in human authority. We have 3 persons in the Trinity with God the Father above all but all three are always in unity with each other. Authority does not mean that the subordinates must be misused or abused by their superiors. Authoritative positions are given to us by God so that we can serve others, and not to expect the subordinates to serve us. Subordinates are given to us by God to assist us in serving others.

An authoritative position gives the person the authority to make rules to enforce discipline, to ensure that everyone obeys the rules, to deal with those who violate rules, to make decisions, to organize things, etc. whether it is in a household, in the Church, at our work place, etc.

By humbling Himself and washing the feet of His disciples (John 13:5), Jesus, the King of all kings, gave us an example of how a person in authority must act. Let us follow His example.

##### Day 353 A gentle and calm disposition

True beauty is not found in fashion, accessories, hairstyles or jewelry. Many people pay to a lot of money on designers cloths and accessories. It's true they may be in fashion but believing that it makes you more beautiful is a lie.
Your adornment should not be an external one: braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or dressing in fine clothes,
4but rather the hidden character of the heart, expressed in the imperishable beauty of a gentle and calm disposition, which is precious in the sight of God. 1 Pet 3:3,4

True beauty is from a gentle and calm disposition, internal beauty of the person is more important than looks.
A calm internal disposition is hard to come by in this disturbing world. But it‚Äôs not impossible to have it if can cast all our care unto the Lord.
Cast all your worries upon him because he cares for you.1 Pet 5:7

The God who created everything we see cares about us, so we need not worry about anything, just stay close to God. God will take care of all our needs. We need to just humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and we will be exalted in due time.

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet 5:6

We also have to be on the watch because the devil our enemy is prowling around looking for who he can devour, he comes to rob steal and destroy.
Let us stay close to God who cares for us, we will be protected if we stay in God‚Äôs shadow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

1 Peter 3:1-2
*Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.*

A woman must lead a devout Christian life, following God's commandments faithfully, so that even if her husband does not obey God's Word, the splendour of her Christian life will draw her husband towards Christ.
And Mary, the mother of Jesus, was the best example of a faithful and godly wife.

1 Peter 3:9-10
*But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God‚Äôs own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.*

A priest is a man chosen by God to offer the prescribed sacrifices on the Altar, in the Temple during worship.

*Once you were not a people, but now you are God‚Äôs people.*

To be "God‚Äôs own people" means to be in a Covenant relation with God. Therefore, to be "not the people of God" means to be outside the Covenant of God (Hosea 2:23b).
Thus the Church is the new Temple as well as the new Israel (Galatians 6:16).

The Theology of Peter's first letter to the Church is of a Church in exile, a Church on a journey, a Church that is moving from this world to the world to come. And just as the first Israel was taken out of Egypt and thereafter became sojourners, moving through the desert to the promised land, so also the believers to whom Peter wrote this letter, were wandering in the earthly exile and moving towards the heavenly promised land.

Family, married life, good works, prayers, etc.... are all spiritual sacrifices.

1 Peter 3:17
*For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that be the will of God, than for doing evil.*

There are 3 reasons why God allows suffering in our lives:

1. To remind us to confess our sins of commission or omission and ask God for forgiveness (1 Peter 4:15).
2. To spiritually heal the good ones (1 Peter 4:14, 16 & 19).
3. To glorify the holy ones, as in the case of Jesus and His mother.
   Whenever we or our families go through suffering, besides praying for a solution or healing, we must focus on making a thorough examination of our conscience and confess any unconfessed sins.

1 Peter 3:19-20
*In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison, who had once been disobedient while God patiently waited in the days of Noah during the building of the ark, in which a few persons, eight in all, were saved through water.*

This was the last phase of the Messianic mission of Jesus.

Purgatory is a temporary condition for a soul that has passed individual judgment but still has the temporal component of sins to atone for before attaining the beatific vision.

Purgatory / Sheol / Hades is like a spiritual hospital (or preparation room) where the venial sins of the righteous ones are purged after they die so that their souls can be covered with white robes before they stand in front of a divine God.

The souls of the righteous ones of the old Covenant were preserved in the same or similar place for their venial sins to be purged until the holy Blood would be shed and the Gospel would be preached to them by Jesus because, although their earthly bodies had perished, their spirits were still alive (example: story of the rich man and Lazarus).

After His death, Jesus went down to Purgatory and preached the Gospel to the righteous ones of the old Covenant who had fallen asleep and thereafter, as prophesied (Daniel 7:22 & 27), they became saints (Mathew 27:52). The cloud of witnesses (Hebrews 12:1) are those saints in Heaven (Hebrews 11:4-38).

In the ongoing liturgical celebration in Heaven (Revelation) all the angels and saints together pray for the saints on earth because our damaged human souls are in great need of God‚Äôs blessings.

While we owe it to our children to hand down the faith to them, we do owe it to our deceased parents, ancestors and other family members to pray for their souls to rest in eternal peace.
The saints in Heaven intercede for us continuously (Revelation). By His death, Jesus reconciled God and man and thereby populated Heaven with saints and thus He also reconciled angels and saints.

On 1st November the Church celebrates the feast of all saints who are already in Heaven, and on 2nd November the Church dedicates the day to pray for the souls of all those saints who are waiting their turn in Purgatory.

1 Peter 3:21
*This prefigured baptism, which now saves you.*
Baptism is not the only time when we were saved.
Salvation is a lifetime process.
Christians are first saved (from going to Hell) when they are baptized, which is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit because Jesus paid the price by shedding His blood on the Cross, 2,000 years ago.
Christians are in the process of being saved during their lifetime when they pick up their crosses and follow Christ faithfully and when they faithfully follow the fundaments of their faith (Repentance, Sharing and Serving).
Christians hope to be saved, if they have endured to the end of their lives.

*It is not a removal of dirt from the body but an appeal to God for a clear conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.*
The great flood, which took place during the time of Noah, was only a symbol of baptism.
The rituals for washing which were introduced in the old Covenant from the time of Moses, were also symbols of the new Covenant baptism but they were also meant to remove dirt from the body as an analogy for the soul.
But the baptism of Jesus is more powerful than its symbols.

The baptism of Jesus saves us from Hell because it washes away spiritual dirt (sins), to purify the soul, and thereby restores divine life within us, which in turn provides us with sanctifying graces to perfect our souls, without which we cannot enter Heaven.

*Water without the Trinity* washes physical dirt because water by itself does not have any power.
*Water + the Trinity* washes spiritual dirt (sins) because the water now has the power of God. The power of the Trinity in the presence of water is sufficient to erase the past sins of a person.

Once we are baptized, we can start receiving the regular sacraments (Reconciliation & Eucharist) to keep our souls constantly sanctified as long as we live.

1 Peter 5:8
*Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.*
The devil roars like a lion to scare people into believing that he is the lion of Judah whereas Jesus is the true lion of Judah (Revelation 5:5).

1 Thessalonians 2:11
*As you know, we dealt with each one of you like a father with his children.*
This is one of the reasons why we call our priests "Father" because they are our spiritual fathers.

##### Day 354 Always Rejoice, Pray and Give Thanks

If you want to live like a disciple you ought to follow these three

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks

Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing.In all circumstances give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-27

It could not be stated any more clearly, that it‚Äôs the will of God for us to always rejoice, pray without ceasing, and give thanks to God in all circumstances.
If it‚Äôs the will of God for us to rejoice always then why is there so much suffering in our lives? Our joy is not mere happiness based on our circumstances, but the inner joy with the knowledge that God is in control of every situation. The rejoicing comes when we count it a blessing to suffer with Christ for the redemption of the world. When we are persecuted for the sake of the Kingdom we count it Joy.

Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you \[falsely\] because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. Thus they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Mat 5:10-12

We are called to rejoice when evil is done against us because of our walk as Christians. Like we read in St Paul‚Äôs letter to the Philippians a few days ago, from his prison cell St Paul asks us to Rejoice. He says it twice, again I say rejoice.

Rejoice in the Lord always. I shall say it again: rejoice!
5Your kindness should be known to all. The Lord is near.
6Have no anxiety at all, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God.
7Then the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Have no anxiety at all, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, may your request be known to God.

We should pray always knowing that God will answer our prayer. Actually Thank God as soon as you pray, even before you receive what you want, Thank God for the blessing that He will bestow on you soon. We may feel that God is not answering our prayer but let us remember it is not for God‚Äôs benefit that it‚Äôs taking time but for our own benefit.
But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like one day.

The Lord does not delay his promise, as some regard ‚Äúdelay,‚Äù but he is patient with you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. 2 Pet 3:9

Although the above scripture is about Jesus‚Äô second coming we can also apply it to our prayer petitions. Even if it seems like a thousand years let us know that God has a plan. So let us be peaceful with the peace that surpasses understanding, thanking God for all the answered prayers and for future blessings. Praying always in the Spirit, using the gift of tongues, with the full armor of God, using the sword of the Spirit the word of God to fight off any anxiety and worry.

Let us always:

1. Rejoice
2. Pray
3. Give Thanks
   ‚Äúfor this is the will of God.‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

##### BIAY Day 354 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Peter 1:4
Saints in Heaven will have certain characteristics of God (example: power, holiness, intelligence, knowledge, love, etc.) but not to the same degree, that is, they will not have the ‚Äúomni‚Äù attributes. Saints in Heaven will still be human but of a highly superior quality. They will be children of God, they will be parttakers of God‚Äôs divine nature and they will be completely sanctified (1 John 3:2-3).

2 Peter 1:20-21
*Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the Holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.*

Peter rules out the option of personal interpretation of the Scriptures. The authority to interpret the Scriptures was given only to the apostles who in turn handed it down to their succeeding apostles / Apostolic bishops.

Often cited, along with 2 Tm 3:16, on the ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù of scripture or against private interpretation, these verses in context are directed against the false teachers of 2 Pt 2 and clever tales (2 Pt 1:16). The prophetic word in scripture comes admittedly through human beings (2 Pt 1:21), but moved by the holy Spirit, not from their own interpretation, and is a matter of what the author and Spirit intended, not the personal interpretation of false teachers. Instead of under the influence of God, some manuscripts read ‚Äúholy ones of God.‚Äù

2 Peter 3:8
*But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.*

We, on earth, are bound by time (days / weeks / months / years, etc.) because light (day) on earth is interrupted by darkness (night) and darkness represents evil. So when we see light again we call it another day and that‚Äôs how we measure time.
But God is not bound by time because in Heaven there is no evil and therefore no darkness, and time cannot be measured when there is no change in the existence of light.

Therefore, even if we complete ten thousand years on earth, in Heaven it is still day 1, which was, which is, and which will be the same forever.
In other words, there will never be a day 2 in Heaven.

2 Peter 3:9
*The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.*

There are people who do such horrendous things in society that our minds struggle to understand such things. Such people make our hearts cry out for justice, and rightly so. But often we go a step further and condemn them to Hell.
The revolutionary attitude takes solace in the destruction of the aggressor.
When people do terrible things, we may sometimes wonder why God does not strike them down immediately and send them to Hell. But this is not God‚Äôs mind. God is teaching us to desire the conversion of hardened sinners, and to pray for them.
Jesus was thirsty (John 19:28), not only for the souls of the saintly, but also for the souls of the most hardened sinners (Matthew 9:12).

God is slow in punishing the wicked because He waits for His children (the Christians) to carry out His Will by helping the wicked to come to repentance with love, peace, kindness, sacrifice, prayers, etc.

Therefore, when a crime is committed, while we generously pray for the victim we must also remember to pray for the culprit, because God wishes that all should be saved.

In a Covenant relation it is always the innocent ones who suffer / pay the price for the sins of the wicked so that the wicked may be saved, just as Jesus suffered for us so that we may be saved.

1 Thessalonians 4:15-17
*For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will by no means precede those who have died. For the Lord himself, with a cry of command, with the archangel‚Äôs call and with the sound of God‚Äôs trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord forever.*

When Paul wrote to the people to be ready always because the end would come soon, the people stopped cultivation and waited for the end of the world. Therefore he changed his message later saying that the end would come soon but we do not know when (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12).

After the final judgment, Jesus will send His angels to gather His elect who are left behind (Matthew 24:31; Revelation 11:15), but Paul and the first century Christians believed that this would happen during their lifetime and so Paul was insisting on the Christians to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. Paul had written the same message to the Corinthians also (1 Corinthians 15:51-52), but the Christians who escaped to the mountains in Pella during the destruction of the Temple, were not taken up alive. Many of them returned to Jerusalem six decades later.

The prophecy of Jesus (Matthew 24:3-8) was meant, primarily, for Jerusalem, to mark the end of the age of the old creation, the old Covenant, the old sacrifice, the old priesthood, and the old Temple because Jesus had already inaugurated the beginning of the new creation when He was baptized and the only thing standing in the way of the new Covenant, the new sacrifice, and the new priesthood was the old Temple. Therefore, it had to be removed and the man-made Temple was destroyed in AD 70 because we now have a temple that is not made by hands, the mystical Body of Christ, the Bread of Life.

The destruction of the Temple in AD 70 was, however, a prophetic sign of the future. The condition of the people was so devastating and horrible that the people thought it was the end of the world. But what happened to Jerusalem and the Temple locally will happen to the Church globally at the end of time. The Church (the mystical Body of Christ) must go through its final passion just as the physical Body of Christ did.

Therefore, Paul‚Äôs prophecy was about the end times or the second coming of the Lord in His glory before the Last Judgement, and the holy ones who will still be living at that time will not see death but an immediate transformation of their bodies, which means that Jesus will not wait for every single human to die before His second physical appearance.

##### Day 355 If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive

One lie of the devil that is spreading rapidly in our younger generation is indifference to God/Religion and relativism. Many people say your truth is your truth and mine is mine. When we have our own standards instead of the standards of God, the concept of sin disappears.

Let us be reminded that we all have sinned and fallen short of God‚Äôs glory. If we say we have no sin then we make God to be a liar.

If we say, ‚ÄúWe are without sin,‚Äù we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
9If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
10If we say, ‚ÄúWe have not sinned,‚Äù we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 Jh 1:8-10

And for those who follow Christ, we need to be in the light and follow his commandments. This will guarantee that we know Christ if we keep his commandments.

The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep his commandments. Whoever says, ‚ÄúI know him,‚Äù but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1 John 2:3-4

We ought to demonstrate our love for Christ by loving our earthly brothers and sisters.
Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness.
10Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. 1 Jh 3:9-10

The world will know us by the love we show to our brothers and sisters. If we say we love God but hate our brother then we are liars and we are not walking in the light.
Do not love the world or the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
16For all that is in the world, sensual lust, enticement for the eyes, and a pretentious life, is not from the Father but is from the world.
17Yet the world and its enticement are passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains forever 1 Jh 2:15-17

We should not love the things of the world as they are passing away. The world with all its glitter and temporary satisfaction will not fulfill our desires. The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life are all passing away. Let us only focus on love of the Lord and his commands. Let us not lust over our brothers and sisters but love them instead. The path to holiness is to humble ourselves instead of walking around proud and pretending to be great. Let us hold to the highest standard of holiness, which is love. Love our brothers and sisters as Christ loved us.

Let us not fear but repent for If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.2 Th 3:5

May the Holy Spirt lead us üôè

##### BIAY Day 355 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 1:8
*If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.*

Sin is not only about robbing a bank or murdering someone or committing adultery.
Due to the fall of man our love for one another has become so distorted that we are not able to love one another without conditions and most of the time we ignore the needy ones. This distorted love causes us to constantly commit sins in our daily lives, by gossiping, complaining, showing off, talking too much, criticizing, insulting, humiliating, abusive language, etc. etc. All these are the result of lack of love in our hearts for the people around us and thus, in following these habits, we disobey the new Commandment given to us by Jesus (John 15:12).

Therefore, knowing the weakness of our souls, God sent His Son to give us the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that, whenever we become aware of our sins, we can repent and renew the broken Covenant by confessing our personal sins (1 John 1:9) and receiving the sacrament (John 20:23). Thereafter we can make atonement for those sins and share in the sacrificial meal so that we can have communion with God once again (John 6:54).

1 John 1:9
If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing.
In the history of salvation, God was not content only to redeem Israel from physical bondage by bringing them out of Egypt (Deut. 5:6) because the people constantly attached themselves to a sinful lifestyle (idolatory, immorality, etc.) and God does not want anyone worshipping Him when they are held in bondage. Therefore, after redeeming them God saved them from their personal sins by forgiving the sins (Leviticus 4:20b, 26b, 31b & 35b; 5:10b, 13a, 16b & 18; 6:7) which were confessed to Him in the presence of the priest (Leviticus 5:5) who would then make atonement for their sins on their behalf (Leviticus 5:6), to purify them symbolically, because sin is always an offence against God, and only He can forgive it.

After the mortal sin of the first Adam, all humans were destined to go to Hell because nothing unclean must enter Heaven (Revelation 21:27. But God had a redemption plan in place, therefore, the souls of all the deceased righteous ones were preserved in Purgatory/Sheol (Numbers 20:26; 27:13; Luke 16:25). By shedding His Blood on the Cross, Jesus redeemed all the deceased righteous people of the old Covenant (Mark 3:27; 1 Peter 3:19-20).

In the new Covenant, however, we are redeemed / released from Satan when we are baptized.

But God was not content only to redeem us. He knows that, due to the weakness of our souls, we are definitely going to break the Covenant over and over again by committing sins between our baptism and our death and He wants us to maintain our baptismal holiness as long as we live. Therefore, He gave us the purification Sacrament.

So now, if we confess our sins as mandated by God (Leviticus 6:7), He will forgive us our sins and renew the Covenant (John 20:23) which we broke with our sins because confession is not complete until the broken Covenant is renewed, atonement is made for the offense and we take part in the sacrificial meal so that we can once again have communion with God.

Meanwhile, all sins confessed with remorse in our hearts, will be forgiven by God (Leviticus 6:7) except sins which are retained by the priest as permitted by Jesus (John 20:23).

1 John 3:1-3
*See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. Beloved, we are God‚Äôs children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.*

Through baptism, God has given us the privilege of being called ‚ÄúHis children.‚Äù Therefore, we must live our lives like children of God and not like children of Satan.
Saints in Heaven will be able to see Jesus as he is, that is, in His glorious state (beatific vision) (Matthew 5:8) because they will be part-takers of God‚Äôs divine nature. But to be able to take part in God‚Äôs divine nature we must repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly, so that we may die in a state of grace, that is, in a Covenant relation with God. Further purification, if required, will be done in Purgatory.

1 John 3:18
*Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.*

God does not want our lip service. He wants us to prove our love for Him by the way we live our lives, that is, by loving one another without conditions, specially by caring for and sharing with the needy ones.

We don't do any good by sympathizing with the suffering people around us and asking others to help them, if we are not making any attempt to help ease their suffering ourselves. If we genuinely cannot give them financial support, we can at least give them physical support and pray for them.

If we become aware of someone who is in need of help, it is not by accident. It is God making us aware because He wants to use our hands to help them.

1 John 3:19-20
*And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.*

Sometimes in the past, when we were angry or extremely annoyed, we may have said or done something that had hurt or damaged someone, severely. But even after we confessed our sin and we were forgiven, our conscience still torments us because of how we hurt that person. John assures us that God is aware whether we have truly repented for our sinful behavior or whether we have confessed our sin for other reasons.
We may succeed in fooling humans / the priests but we can't fool God.

2 Thessalonians 2:15
*Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught, which you received either by word or by a letter of ours.*
The Church didn't have a Bible in hand until the end of the third century AD. Therefore, the written Tradition which Paul was referring to were all the epistles which he had written to the Christians to correct their errors, discipline them, etc.
The oral Tradition was however handed down through their successors.

[![God Is Love](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day356.jpg)](https://youtu.be/hCHHw_GVAZI "God Is Love")

##### BIAY Day 356 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 John 4:20
*Whoever claims to love God, and yet hates a brother or sister, is a liar. For Those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen.*

The biblical understanding of true love is to will for the good of others, irrespective of whether they are related to us or not and irrespective of whether they love us or not, because ‚ÄúLove‚Äù is self-giving, and when others are in distress or troubled we are willing to pay a price to help them, even if it costs us our lives.

1 John 5:6
*This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is the witness, and the Spirit is truth.*

This verse refers to the baptism (water) and crucifixion (blood) of Jesus.

During the baptism of Jesus, God the Father declared that Jesus was His Son and this was witnessed by the Holy Spirit who appeared in the form of a dove.

When Jesus was crucified, after His death the centurion declared that Jesus was the Son of God. It is believed that the centurion was inspired by the Holy Spirit because the centurion was a stranger and had no other way of knowing anything about the divine sonship of Jesus.

1 John 5:16-17
*If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God will give life to such a one. This is only for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal.*

There are two type of sins: Mortal (deadly or fatal) and Venial (forgiveable).
*Mortal sin* instantly destroys the divine life or the life of God within us, as it did with Adam and Eve. Divine life gives us the ability to love without conditions but it is still subject to our choice.
*Venial sin* diminishes the divine life within us but does not destroy it instantly.

By virtue of our Baptism we belong to God's family. Therefore, as an act of charity, and if we ourselves are in the Body of Christ, then we can pray and make atonement on behalf of the living believers on earth (Church militant) or deceased believers who have committed venial sins and are still in the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-26) (Church suffering in Purgatory) and God will restore their divine or supernatural life ("zoay" in Greek).
We can pray for both types of venial sinners (Church militant and Church suffering) because both types belong to God's supernatural family. But we cannot make atonement on behalf of the living or dead baptized members who have committed mortal sins because the guilty ones need to repent and that can be done only when they are living. Moreover, mortal sins sever the baptized members from the Body of Christ. The living ones can, however, once again become part of the Body of Christ after they repent and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and make atonement for their sins but the deceased ones have no hope of being saved. Meanwhile, we can pray for the conversion of the living ones (1 Timothy 2:1-2).

1 John 5:18
*We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one cannot touch them.*
Jesus protects us from Satan from the time we are baptized because our baptism puts Satan on a leash therefore he cannot touch our souls (Mark 3:27). But Satan tries to control us by luring us into his den with his deceptive offers of wealth, power, comfort, entertainment, etc. To receive those offers we must get close to Satan. When we choose to get close to him, we are actually going far from Christ and we fall into Satan‚Äôs dangerous trap, which is only a candy-coated ball of destruction. The only way out of the trap is to follow God‚Äôs commandments, repent and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist, regularly, to give us the strength to fight Satan spiritually and stay with Christ.

1 Timothy 2:4
*God desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.*
God has predestined every human for glory.
Damnation is a failure of the human will or persisting in a willful turning away from God, to the end.

A good teacher always wishes that all his/her students must succeed in the final exams. The teacher provides all the necessary resources, guidance and support to help everyone succeed but some students may still end up as failures by their own choices due to little or no effort from their side. The teacher, however, did not prepare those students for failure.

We are not robots acting out a pre-programmed script. We have free will to make our choice so let us make wise choices and choose God‚Äôs Will for us.

1 Timothy 2:1-4
*First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good and pleasing to God our savior, who wills everyone to be saved and to come to knowledge of the truth.*
As per the above instructions of Paul, our petitions for our country, community, world, etc. are/must be included during Mass (Prayer of the Faithful) every Sunday because the sins of Christians have a negative effect on the community and environment around us. Therefore, since the Church is a universal institution, we must pray for all people, specially for the Church and for those who are responsible for the welfare of the country.

During this intercession (Prayer of the Faithful) we must pray for:

1. the Church.
2. the world
3. the government
4. the sick and the suffering
5. specific needs
6. the deceased members of the community.

These are the prayers which are received by the angels and saints in Heaven and answered by God according to His Will (Revelation 5:8).
These prayers are sent up to God because we are part of the Communion of Saints in Heaven through baptism, but we have still not accomplished our mission on earth. We encounter many obstacles in our daily lives which make it difficult for us to accomplish our mission on earth and remain holy, due to the damaged nature of our souls and because we are still in the flesh.
These prayers include general needs of the Church community, the public authorities, the oppressed, etc., whatever could be a possible obstacle in maintaining the holiness of the Church (God‚Äôs people).

1 Timothy 2:5-6
*For there is one God; there is also one mediator between God and man, Christ Jesus, himself human, who gave himself a ransom for all.*
Jesus is the only mediator between God the Father and man, but not the only intercessor. Jesus can mediate because He is both God and man.

##### Day 356 One Mediator and Traditions

We all have Christian names and go to church, but what really shows that we are Christians is the love that we have each other.

Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God.
8Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another.
12No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us.
We love because he first loved us.
20If anyone says, ‚ÄúI love God,‚Äù but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
1 Jh 4: 7,8,11,12,19,20

So it is obvious that God loved us first and we received a nature of love from God as we are Children of God. As children of God we ought to love God and love our neighbor. Loving God can seem easy as we need to follow his commandments and we receive a lot of love from God. It can seem awfully hard to love our neighbor as we live among broken people. People have anger problems and can be liars, lovers of money, blinded by lust and selfish. We also naturally love ourselves a lot and find it hard to love others like we love ourselves.
Who can save us from this, thanks be to God, the one in me is greater than the one in the world.

You belong to God, children, and you have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 1 Jh 4:4:
We should draw strength from the Holy Spirit in us, to fight off the evil forces outside us.
On a couple of apologetic topics, there is usually a lot of confusion about the one mediator verse in Timothy.

For there is one God.
There is also one mediator between God and the human race, Christ Jesus, himself human,
6who gave himself as ransom for all. 1 Tim 2:5,6

This is used a lot against the sacrament of confession ‚Äì we also know that Jesus instituted the sacrament himself and gave authority to the apostles to forgive sins. Just as they act as mediators to baptize people or pray for healing or preach God‚Äôs word. Mary and the saints are also mediators of God‚Äôs grace from heaven. The heavenly church(church glorified) does not have any powers or graces of their own, they are but mediators that bring our prayer intentions to God.
Another topic is that the Bible is the ultimate source of truth. For starters the Bible never claims to be the ultimate source of truth, in fact, it was the church led by the Spirit that put the Bible together. Jesus never gave us a book but he gave us a Pope ‚Äì Peter and gave him authority which got handed over to this very generation.

But if I should be delayed, you should know how to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of truth. I Tim 3:15

In fact the Bible says that Church is the pillar and foundation of truth. And that the apostles and prophets are the foundation of the Church.
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone. Ep 2:20

Also we are called to hold firm to the traditions of the church which have be taught through word and letter.

So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter. 2 The 2:15

So here is an apologetics 101 answer to the questions the ‚Äúone Mediator‚Äù and ‚ÄúSola scriptura -Bible alone‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

##### Day 357 The love of money is the root of all evils

We live in a very materialistic world and people try to buy themselves out of all problems. This approach will never leave anyone fulfilled. Money can‚Äôt buy you everything in fact the more money one has the more one wants to get. Many people have spent their whole lives trying to be successful and end up so sick that they can‚Äôt even enjoy the money they saved.
For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains. 1 Tim 6:10

We see people working multiple jobs to make it big in life, constantly thinking of how to make more money. This has caused them to skip Mass and other important spiritual activities. This also has drawn people away from family life. We see many young couples not wanting kids because they want a successful career. Let us stop for a moment and think what if we gain the whole world but lose our soul.
Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction. 1 Tim 6:9

For we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out of it. 1 Tim 6:7

Let us remember that we came in empty-handed into this world and we will take nothing back with us.
Alexander the Great who conquered most of the world said ‚ÄúWith my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I want people to know that I came empty-handed into this world and likewise will go empty-handed from this world.‚Äù
Let us learn from Alexander the Great that when we die we take nothing with us.
Let us learn from the rich people who commit suicide due to depression that money does not buy everything.
In fact, the more money we give away for a good cause, the happier we feel. The other extreme is also dangerous, where people don‚Äôt want to spend anything on themselves.
When we give we should be smart in giving, as some people are in the habit of taking money and having a good time. Like beggars who only beg to have their next drink or joint.
There are also lazy and greedy people in this world who would take money even though they are not truly in need.
In the early church, some widows were probably taking advantage of the church‚Äôs generosity. The apostles had to become prudent about who gets aid and who does not.
If any woman believer has widowed relatives, she must assist them; the church is not to be burdened so that it will be able to help those who are truly widows. 1 Tim 5:16

So the next time you think of giving someone money, pray about it and try to use sound judgment. Give to those who are in need and will really use it. For example, you may want to give food instead of money to a drunk.
The Lord will bless us with good finances if we don‚Äôt run after money. Seek first His kingdom and all things will be added to you.
The right use of money is essential.
7Tell the rich in the present age not to be proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing as wealth but rather on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.
18Tell them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, ready to share,
19thus accumulating as treasure a good foundation for the future, so as to win the life that is true life. 1 Tim 6:17-19

Our goal is eternal life, money will come and money will go, but our soul will live forever.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### BIAY Day 357 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Timothy 4:14
*Do not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate.*
By the laying on of their hands, the Apostles ordained Timothy and other men to serve as presbyters (priests), under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

Timothy was later appointed as the Bishop of Ephesus.

1 Timothy 6:10
*For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.*

Money is not evil. What is evil is the kind of person who we become when we start giving more importance to our money. It is the love of money that gives rise to evil.
When money becomes our god (idol worship), then we start inviting evil spirits into our lives and into our homes. Our love for money causes us to fight with others, break human relations, and sometimes go to extreme ends (fraud, lies, murder, theft, false accusations, etc.) to possess it.

When money comes into our hands we feel we are superior to others and we begin to disrespect the ones who are financially below our level.
When we have a successful career we start idolizing our jobs because of the money it brings in.
Sometimes we also idolize our possessions because we spent a lot of money on them.
Even if we worship God on the side, our focus will always be on the people and activities which bring in money. We give less or no time and importance to God, but more time and importance to the people and areas related to money.

When God blesses us financially, He expects us to raise our *standard of giving*, not our *standard of living*, but when we have money with us the temptation to *keep* will be much stronger than the desire to *give* and we may find all kinds of excuses why we *cannot* and *should not* and *must not* give.

We are not supposed to love our money. God wants us to spread love, live a simple life and share our extras with the less fortunate ones around us.

Paul was writing to the Christians in Ephesus who may have been living in obedience to the Church laws and the commandments, but were also carried away with unhealthy practices in their desire for acquiring riches.
Even a faithful Christian who keeps all God‚Äôs commandments, obeys the Church laws and attends Church service / Mass regularly, can flow with the crowd and get tricked by the devil into believing that it is not wrong to do such things. Therefore we must be very careful about the kind of people we associate with.

Idol worship is a direct violation of God‚Äôs commandment and is therefore a mortal sin, and as Paul warns us, we must not receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist in a state of mortal sin (1 Corinthians 11:27). It is therefore important that we repent, receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation and change our lives before receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).

Without the grace of God we cannot give freely the way God wants us to give. Therefore we must pray to God daily to give us that special grace.

##### From Rebellion to Faithfulness

##### Day 358 St Michael the ArchAngel protect us

In today‚Äôs reading we see St Michael come up.
Yet the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment\* upon him but said, ‚ÄúMay the Lord rebuke you!‚Äù Jude 1:9

St Michael the Archangel comes up a few other times in Daniel and the book of the revelations to mention a few. St Michael is also attributed with the angel in the garden of eden and the angel that led the Isrealites in the desert. Catholic tradition also attributes St Michael of taking Mother Mary to Heaven when her time on earth was over.
St Michael is considered the guarding of the Church as he is always seen fighting and defending the church.
The popular prayer (below) to St Michael the Archangel is condensed from the prayer Pope Leo XIII wrote in 1886 when he had that horrific vision of the demonic spirits gathering on the eternal city (Rome) and Satan threatening to destroy the church in 100 years.
Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel:
"St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen"
This prayer is a very powerful prayer that we should include in our daily devotions, pray it in the morning, on your commute, over your children, over the sick, over those who are in danger of death, for protections against temptations, for physical and spiritual protections from the evil one.
St. Michael the Archangel has always been known to be a powerful intercessor against evil, especially since he is recorded in the Book of Revelation as, ‚Äúfighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven‚Äù (Revelation 12:7-9). Based on this episode in scripture, St. Michael is frequently depicted in art thrusting a lance, spear or sword into Satan, who is often depicted as a serpent or dragon.
Let us not fail to invoke the protection of St Michael the archangel everyday.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### BIAY Day 358 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jude 1:9
*But when the archangel Michael argued with the devil in a dispute over the body of Moses, Michael did not venture to pronounce a reviling judgment upon him but said, ‚ÄúMay the Lord rebuke you!‚Äù*

If an Archangel refrained from reviling the devil, then it is even more wrong for mere humans to revile the angels or any of God‚Äôs creation, irrespective of whether they are good or bad.

God sends rain and sunshine on the good as well as on the evil (Mathew 5:45), because in God‚Äôs eyes we are all His children and we are all equal. Even the bad angels were created by God therefore we don‚Äôt please God when we revile or speak ill of the bad angels or bad people. Instead, when we revile the bad ones we are actually making a Covenant with Satan to fight with his devils, and Michael was aware of this.
God wills that everyone should be saved (1 Timothy 2:4-5), therefore, instead of being judgemental about those who have gone away from God, let us help them to come back to God.

Normally Satan is always interested in claiming souls of the dead but this time he was interested in the body of the dead.

It is not clear why Satan was interested in the body of Moses but Satan does not have the power to use the bodies of the dead because he would have to resurrect those bodies in order to use them and that requires infinite power which he does not have. Only God can truly raise the dead.

Satan is, however, constantly trying to stop God‚Äôs will from being executed in the world. Therefore, most likely, he would either have been given the knowledge that God has a special plan for the body of Moses or he may have guessed it because of the angelic activity that would have surrounded the body of Moses along with Michael.
Moses, eventually, did appear during the transfiguration of Jesus, which was witnessed by three of the apostles.

Jude 1:11
*Woe to them! They followed the way of Cain, abandoned themselves to Balaam‚Äôs error for the sake of gain, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.*

*What was Korah‚Äôs rebellion?*
Korah was a non-ordained Levite, but his 250 men were not even Levites and yet they all claimed that they too were holy and could offer the sacrifices relegated to the priesthood (Numbers 16:3), even though they were not called by God for the priesthood. By protesting against Moses and Aaron who were God‚Äôs anointed people, they were protesting against God. Therefore the earth opened up and swallowed them and thus they all perished physically.

Jude did not write to the Jews but to Christians and warned us not to claim what is not allowed to us. We are required to carry out whatever mission God has assigned to us even if it has no significance. Whatever mission we carry out on earth is all part of God‚Äôs plan therefore we must not be picky and choosey about what we are expected to do. If we protest against God‚Äôs anointed people, we will perish spiritually (Hell).

Cain was envious of his own brother and therefore killed him.
Balaam was given supernatural power but he used his gift to fill his pockets.

Let us not imitate any of these three men.

2 Timothy 1:1-7
Paul had developed a very close friendship with Timothy who was also very active in the Church and someone whom Paul could entrust with the preaching of the Gospel.

It is very important for us to have friends who walk with us towards God.

Timothy learnt about the faith from his mother and grandmother.

It is important for us to live our faith as true Christians so that the next generation will see our fidelity to Christ and pass that on to their future generations.

Paul was writing from prison and at that time Timothy may have not felt confident enough, on his own, to handle the negative issues that the Church has to constantly face. But Timothy was going to be Paul's successor therefore Paul was writing words of encouragement to Timothy that by his ordination he received a Spirit of power, not of fear. Therefore Timothy was required to stir up the Holy Spirit, boldly face the attacks of the evil one, whether physical or spiritual, and stand for the truth, while maintaining his own holiness, even if it meant that he had to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

But this advice was not only for Timothy.

When we receive the Holy Spirit through the sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, Matrimony, Holy Orders, etc.) we are required to obey God and pray to the Holy Spirit every day to help us keep His flame burning in us always, as long as we live, so that we can be instrumental in making Christ known to the people around us by the way we live our Christian lives, even if we have to go through suffering for the sake of the Gospel.

*For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands;*
By the power of God invested in them through their ordination, the Bishops and priests bring God's graces to their congregations in a special and reverent way, through the sacraments.

*For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but a spirit of power and love and self-control.*
The Lord will always give us the love and self-control we need to bear our share of hardship for the Gospel, with a strength that can come from God alone.
Our task is to continue doing what He has commanded, to love and to build up His kingdom.

2 Timothy 2:14-19
It is not wrong to be a good public speaker but using that talent to mislead people and take them away from God for selfish reasons is wrong.

2 Timothy 1:8-10
Paul was addressing Timothy but this epistle is valid for Christians of all times.
Many of the first century Jewish Christians believed that when a person becomes a Christian he will be free of suffering, because it was the ancient belief in Israel that suffering is caused by the sins of either the suffering person or his parents (John 9:2). They were probably of the opinion that baptism will wash away all the sins of their lifetime (past, present and future). But the reality is different.

Suffering is not always caused by our sins. Sometimes we have to suffer because of our faith in Christ.
By our baptism we are adopted into God‚Äôs family and we become missionaries of Christ to help in the growth of the Church (the Kingdom of God on earth). But we cannot become members of God‚Äôs family unless we are sinless, and baptism washes away all past sins including original sin, but not our future sins.

According to God‚Äôs initial divine plan, man and woman were to increase and multiply and fill the earth (Genesis 1:28). At that point the earth was sanctified and man & woman were holy and full of grace. Therefore, man & woman were given the responsibility to fill the earth and worship God on earth, as it is in Heaven, until it was time for man & woman and all their progeny to go to God. But when sin entered the world God had to alter His divine plan.

Therefore Baptism is not the result of our works. It is a gift from God to save us from eternal punishment by entering His Kingdom on earth (the Church) and preparing ourselves to have communion with Him for eternity by worshipping Him in a state of grace and growing in holiness through the sacraments, while we also busy ourselves with the growth of His Kingdom on earth by filling the Church with souls.

This means, after we are baptized we must be willing to share the suffering of Christ even to the point of death, because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there‚Äôs strong resistance from the demonic, and that is because sin still exists in the world. Jesus came to earth to divinize the world with His touch, but because of sin He had to suffer, shed His Blood and taste death.

Paul was reminding Timothy, and us, to take our share of suffering for the Gospel (or ‚Äúgood news‚Äù) because each individual Christian, as a member of the Body of Christ, has a share in the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ for the sake of the Gospel.
Paul used the word ‚ÄúGospel‚Äù to refer to the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.
We are called to the faith by a Holy Calling, through the grace of baptism, the very reason for which we were created.

2 Timothy 2:8-13
In baptism, Christians die spiritually with Christ and hope to live with him and reign with him forever, but Christian life includes endurance, witness, and even suffering, as Paul‚Äôs own case makes clear; while he is bound by chains in prison, for preaching the Gospel (2 Timothy 2:9), he continues teaching his people because the Word of God is not chained. By his example he shows us that nothing should stop us from our love for God and sharing the Word of God with others (Romans 8:35-37). Therefore Paul‚Äôs sufferings are helpful to the elect for obtaining the salvation and glory available in Christ (2 Timothy 2:10), who will be true to those who are faithful even through suffering, and will disown those who deny him (2 Timothy 2:12).

##### John's Apocalypse

[![John's Apocalypse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day359.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cLKNkdyrb94 "John's Apocalypse")

##### Day 359 Behold I stand at the door and knock.

In the book of the revelations John finds himself in what seems like heaven, he finds himself face to face with Jesus. Of Course it‚Äôs hard to describe in human language what he actually saw and heard. He tries to compare it to things that we can relate to, the phrases ‚Äúlike a fiery flame‚Äù, ‚Äúvoice was like the sound of rushing water ‚Äú, ‚Äúhis face shone like the sun at its brightest.‚Äù It is impossible to describe God, especially when we encounter Him in all his glory. Our reaction would be no less than John‚Äôs reaction, in fact we may be even more fearful as none of use are as worthy as John who stood by Jesus at the cross, accepted Jesus‚Äô mother Mary as his own and even was willing to die for Christ, he was boiled but did not die - thrown on the island of Patmos to die.
When I caught sight of him, I fell down at his feet as though dead. He touched me with his right hand and said, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid. I am the first and the last, the one who lives. Once I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever. I hold the keys to death and the netherworld. Rev 1:17,18
Jesus has already died on the cross for us and paid for our sins. He rose again and lives forever, now Jesus holds the keys to death and life and wants us to make every effort possible to be saved. Many have the idea that Jesus died for us and we don‚Äôt need to do anything to go to heaven. Not doing anything is like having a billion dollars in the bank but not using it. The reading in Timothy that we heard today drives this point home.
7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. 2 Tim 4:7-8
Tying the above scripture to the words of Jesus ‚ÄúTo the victor‚Äù repeated in all the instructions to the 7 churches, we know for a fact that we are to keep fighting and running the race, keeping the faith till the end, we will receive the crown of righteousness not just because of our holiness but because of our faithful persistence in living a good life and loving Jesus.
‚ÄúTo the victor, who keeps to my ways until the end,I will give authority over the nations. Rev 2:26
We all are trying our best and working in the Lord‚Äôs vineyard enduring many sufferings but we need to ask ourselves this question everyday, ‚ÄúHave we lost our first love for Christ?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we just going through the motions and have lost our desire to have an intermittent loving relationship with Christ?‚Äù
‚ÄúI know your works, your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot tolerate the wicked; you have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not, and discovered that they are impostors. Moreover, you have endurance and have suffered for my name, and you have not grown weary.
Yet I hold this against you: you have lost the love you had at first. Rev 2:2-4
As time goes on in our spiritual lives we tend to become mediocre in our faith. Sunday Mass seems like an obligation and doing charity seems like a burden. We don‚Äôt seem to have any desire to evangelize and seem to be very fickle in our holiness. Let us read these words of Jesus and repent of any such laziness.
‚ÄúI know your works; I know that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. Rev 3:15-16
Reading this harsh warning may cause us to get afraid of Christ, but remember God only Chastises the ones He loves. Jesus always wants the best for us, he gives us many opportunities to repents and is always standing by the door waiting to come into our lives and redeem us.
Those whom I love, I reprove and chastise. Be earnest, therefore, and repent. ‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, \[then\] I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me. Rev 3:
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Revelation (Introduction)
The Book of Revelation has always been a scary story for many people, the same feeling that Adam and Eve went through when they chose to see the Word of God through the eyes of Satan.
But at the beginning of the Bible, after the fall of Adam & Eve, God had promised to redeem us (Genesis 3:15). Thereafter, throughout the Bible, God has been giving us hope for a glorious life with Him for eternity. God would therefore NOT go back on His promise and drown our hope with a scary story at the end of the Bible because God is a loving Father who always keeps His promises.
This Book is not a warning about future geopolitics or an instruction book for the end-times.
For the first century Christians, this book was about current and future events.
For us in the 21st century, this book is about past, present and future events.
This book shows us how God is worshipped in Heaven so that we understand why we must follow a liturgical service to worship God on earth.

The Book of Revelation is a summary of the entire Bible. Therefore we will not be able to understand the Book of Revelation unless we understand the entire Bible (old and new Testaments).

For the first century Jewish Christians, the Book of Revelation was a picture of the Temple in Heaven and the heavenly liturgy, which seemed to match with their earthly Temple and their earthly liturgy.
Like Moses (Exodus 25:9), King David also received the plan of the Temple from God Himself.

The Temple was to be built according to the Court/Temple of Heaven (Wisdom 9:8; Hebrews 8:5).
Therefore the liturgy of the first Passover, which God gave to Moses, and the liturgy of the new Passover (the Mass), which Jesus gave to the Apostles, were meant to be replicas of the ongoing liturgy in Heaven.
Whereas Israel worshipped God in imitation of the angels, John saw one common worship in the heavenly Temple shared by men and angels.
Whereas only priests were allowed in the Holy place of Solomon's Temple, in Heaven there was a nation of priests (Revelation 5:10).
The Jewish Christians could also see many things happening in Heaven exactly as they celebrated the new Covenant Passover (the Mass):

The union of Heaven and earth, during Mass, is like the fruitful union of a man and his wife in love. That is why the Church is called ‚Äúthe bride of Christ‚Äù and the book of Revelation unveils that bride. The ‚Äúapokalypsis‚Äù is therefore the communion of the Church and Christ, which is also referred to as ‚Äúthe marriage supper of the Lamb.‚Äù

The same imagery is used in the Book of Revelation for the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9) because our physical marriages on earth reflect the spiritual marriage between Jesus and His bride (the Church).

The best way to understand the Book of Revelation is to see it in the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass, and the best way to understand the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass is to see it in the Book of Revelation. Both must go together; they are inseparable; they cannot be divorced.

Worship, in Heaven includes :

1. the Liturgy of the Word, and
2. the Liturgy of the Eucharist / new Passover.

The two halves of the Heavenly liturgy correspond with the two parts of the Liturgy of the new Passover / Mass on earth.

In chapter 1, Jesus blesses the Lectors who read the three Readings (the Scriptures and Psalms) at the beginning of the Liturgical Service during Mass; Jesus also blesses those in the congregation who hear the Word of God attentively and apply it to their lives.

Chapter 2 represents the Penitential Rite where Jesus reminds the congregations to repent for their sins.

2 Timothy 3:14-15
*But you, remain faithful to what you have learned and believed, because you know from whom you learned it, and that from infancy you have known the sacred scriptures, which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.*

Learning scripture must be started at a young age, preferably from childhood, as commanded by God, because our memory power is strongest than when we get older. Timothy was able to learn the Scriptures during his childhood because his mother and grandmother were godly women. Like them, if we help our children to be familiar with the Scriptures when they start learning to speak, it will help them to know how to face negative situations and fight evil as they grow up, just as Jesus did (Matthew 4:3-10), and thus remain close to God at all times.

2 Timothy 3:16-17
*All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof/ refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so that the one who belongs to God may be competent/proficient, equipped for every good work.*

‚ÄúTheopneustos‚Äù in Greek means Inspired or God-breathed.
But although the scriptures are the Word of God, they bear the style of the human authors.
This is a mystery similar to the incarnation.

Just as the Word of God in flesh is both human and divine, so also the Word of God in scripture is both human and divine (God‚Äôs Word written by human hands) (Exodus 34:1 & 27-28).
Just as the Word of God in flesh took on every nature of humans except sin, so also the inspired Word of God in scripture comes to us with all the limitations of human language, except errors.

Scripture was not dictated by God. The Holy Spirit inspired the Evangelists to write the scriptures but allowed them to use their talents to write, so the accounts recorded by all four are not exactly the same word-to-word. It is like the Holy Spirit taking a picture of the same object with four cameras of different brands.

God is its principal author, with the writer as the human collaborator.
Thus the Scriptures are the Word of God in human language.

Paul tells Timothy to continue in what he has learned for two reasons:
a) because he has been educated in the scriptures, and;
b) because he knows from whom he has learned it (Paul himself). This is a direct appeal to apostolic tradition, the oral teaching which the apostle Paul had given Timothy.

If we don't understand the Bible then it just means we have to study it in more detail or do some research ourselves under the guidance of the right teachers.

But although all scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for correction, for training in righteousness, etc., teaching the faith is not limited only to written scripture, because faith cannot be understood completely only from written tradition. To understand faith completely we need the help of the written tradition as well as the traditions handed down by word of mouth, which we need to hold fast to, as Paul tells us (2 Thessalonians 2:15).

2 Timothy 4:21
*Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers and sisters.*

After the death of Peter, Linus was chosen to be the successor of Peter as the second Pope / Prime Minister of the holy Kingdom. Linus was a Roman Christian.

##### Heavenly Worship

[![Heavenly Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day360.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rnn_VeSKdTQ "Heavenly Worship")

##### Day 360 Mass - heaven on earth as understood in the book of Revelations.

As we read through the book of revelations we can feel lost and the book can seem very Sci Fi or apocalyptic. The verse that can put it into perspective is

I was caught up in spirit on the Lord‚Äôs day and heard behind me a voice as loud as a trumpet. Rev 1:10

It was the Lord‚Äôs day which is Sunday for the Christian as Jesus rose from the dead on Sunday. The early Christians would celebrate the Eucharist on Sunday, John was alone on the island of Patmos and Jesus wanted to reveal to Him what actually happens during Mass. The heavens are open and the church militant(us) is united to the Church glorified (Saints and Angels in heaven) in the worship of the Lamb of God. The book of revelations shows how the Eucharist is the wedding feast of the Lamb where heaven and earth unite.

The Lord‚Äôs Supper, because of its connection with the supper which the Lord took with his
disciples on the eve of his Passion and because it anticipates the wedding feast of the Lamb in
the heavenly Jerusalem. CCC 1329

The title the ‚Äúwedding feast of the Lamb‚Äù is seen in the book of Revelation.

‚ÄúThen the angel said to me, ‚ÄúWrite this: Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding
feast of the Lamb.‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúThese words are true; they come from God.‚Äù‚Äù Rev 19:9

The book of Revelation was written in a coded or concealed form such that the Roman Empire
would not discover the actual context. However, a deeper reading can help us find clues that
the book has a lot of references to the Eucharist.

As already mentioned it was the Lord‚Äôs day that John was caught up in the spirit. Rev 1:10

He sees an altar Rev 8:3 ;
candles Rev 1:12 ;
incense Rev 5:8 ;
priests dressed in robes Rev 4:4 .
And he sees bread or manna Rev 2:17
and bowls or chalices of blood Rev 16 .
He sees heavenly worshippers ‚Äì angels and saints ‚Äì crying, ‚ÄúHoly, Holy, Holy‚Äù Rev 4:8
singing a hymn to the glory of God, the heavenly king Rev 15:3-4 and
shouting ‚Äúalleluia‚Äù; Rev 19:1,3,6
making the sign of the cross on their foreheads Rev 14:1 .
finally, the ‚Äúwedding feast of the Lamb Rev 19:9 .

The multiple use of the word ‚Äúlamb of God‚Äù and more importantly Jesus‚Äôs words

‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, \[then\] I
will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me.‚Äù Rev 3:20
At the wedding feast of the Mass, Jesus comes into our hearts through the door, our mouth when
we receive the most eloquent of all foods Jesus‚Äôs body and blood and He dines with us. Jesus is
the Bridegroom and the church is the bride, the Eucharist in the intimate union of the
Bridegroom and the bride, the church Militant, Suffering and Triumphant.

1382 The Mass is at the same time, and inseparably, the sacrificial memorial in which the
sacrifice of the cross is perpetuated and the sacred banquet of communion with the Lord‚Äôs
body and blood. But the celebration of the Eucharistic sacrifice is wholly directed toward the
intimate union of the faithful with Christ through communion. To receive communion is to
receive Christ himself who has offered himself for us.

At this sacred banquet we received Christ himself and are intimately united to Him and to the
Church. The Eucharist forms sacred links uniting the faithful, we are one body in Christ.
‚ÄúThe communion of the sacraments are sacred links uniting the faithful with one another and
binding them to Jesus Christ, it is primarily the Eucharist that brings this communion about.‚Äù

CCC 950
The Early church not only proclaimed the Eucharist but also remembered Jesus in the daily
breaking of the bread.
‚ÄúIn the first community of Jerusalem, believerst ;devoted themselves to the apostles teaching
and fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and the prayers. This sequence is characteristic of
the Church‚Äôs prayer: founded on the apostolic faith; authenticated by charity; nourished in the
Eucharist.‚Äù CCC 2624

In conclusion let us not forget that we are ‚ÄúBlessed‚Äù to partake in this sacrament for it‚Äôs the most
intimate union one can have with God on earth. Jesus is truly present in the Eucharist, body,
blood, soul and divinity. This prayer from the Eucharistic liturgy reminds us that we are truly
blessed,

‚ÄúBlessed are those who are called to the supper of the lamb‚Äù. Rev 19:9
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

##### BIAY Day 360 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 4:1-2
This was a shadow of the new Covenant Sunday worship (John saw the vision on a Sunday).
After our sins are forgiven during the Penitential Rite of the Mass, when the Priest invites us to ‚ÄòLift up our hearts‚Äô and we agree by saying, ‚Äúwe lift them up to the Lord,‚Äù like John, our spirits are lifted up to Heaven to continue worshipping God with the angels and saints in Heaven, while our bodies are still on the earth.

Jesus invites us up to Heaven every Sunday, not by dying but, in the spirit, to worship God.
When we worship the Lord during Mass on Sundays, we are actually attending the Mass with Jesus in Heaven, not in body but, in spirit.

Revelation 4:4
The 24 Elders or Priests ("Presbyteroi" in Greek) in Heaven were represented by the 24 Priestly divisions who served in the Temple in any given year.
In Heaven, the 24 Elders/Priests are the Patriarchs of the 12 tribes and the 12 Apostles.

Revelation 4:5
This was represented by the Minorah in the Temple of the Old Covenant, the Minorah being a foreshadow of the Holy Spirit.
The Seven flaming torches are the 7 Archangels who stand in front of the Throne of God and always serve Him (Revelation 8:2), as per Archangel Raphael (Tobit 12:15).

Revelation 4:6-7
The four living creatures before the Throne in Heaven were represented by the four Cherubims carved on the wall of the Temple.
The four living creatures are the apex of the praise of God in Heaven;
The four evangelists are the apex for proclaiming the Word made flesh on earth by giving us the accounts of the life, death and resurrection of Christ.

This was the same vision which was shown to Moses (Numbers 2:1-34). The 12 tribes of Israel were to be stationed around the four sides of the Temple, with 3 tribes in each group, so that when God looked down at them from heaven it looked like a Cross. The priestly tribe (the Levites) were to be stationed at the center of the Temple.

Revelation 4:8
Jesus has made us worthy to receive Him in the company of angels and saints in God‚Äôs holy Temple, because we have been purified during the Penitential Rite of the Mass (Revelation chap. 2 & 3). We therefore join the angels and saints in glorifying God with their unending hymn of praise, around God‚Äôs Altar, the hymn which was heard even by Isaiah after he was purified ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, Lord of hosts, Heaven and earth are full of Your glory‚Ä¶......‚Äù (Isaiah 6:3).
At this point Heaven and earth become one and both worship God together.

The battle between good and evil will not be over until the bride of Christ (the Church) will be handed over to God the Father and *all the angels and saints* will sing "holy, holy, holy,,......" in Heaven.

Revelation 4:10
Worship in heaven is physical as well as vocal. There's a lot of bowing down and kneeling, along with prayers, which are signs of humility and reverence.

God has given us a flexible body so that we can use it to worship and glorify Him.
We join our hands in prayer, we kneel to humble ourselves when praying, we genuflect in reverence, we stand to sing hymns and hear the Gospel, we sit to sing hymns and hear the Readings (other than the Gospel), we bow our heads or back in adoration or reverence.

Revelation 5:1
God had a message for His people.

The scroll contained the promises of the New Covenant Law (the Gospel) which only the Lamb of God was worthy enough to open and read in heaven because He was the only sinless One who was worthy enough to be the Lamb for the New Covenant to save the world.

The early Christians read the Word of God (Old Testament) from scrolls during the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass). They did not have the Old Testament combined in a book (the Bible) (Luke 4:17) and they did not even have the New Testament document because it was not documented till the end of the first century. The books of the Bible (Old and New Testaments) were combined into one book much later (around the 4th century AD) by Saint Jerome. Thereafter the Church has always read the Word of God (Old and New Testaments) from the Bible.

Revelation 5:5-6
Jesus is the only one who can proclaim the Word of God through our anointed priests and Deacons, during the the Mass.
Jesus, the king of the universe, is compared to a lion, the king, to symbolize His victory (Genesis 49:9).

Then I saw between the throne ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. a lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered/slain.
Jesus wasn't walking on four legs like the earthly lambs, and an earthly lamb cannot hold a scroll or anything else with its front paw.
The Lamb was a representation of Jesus in His humanity.

Christ has died, Christ has been buried, Christ has risen, Christ has ascended, Christ is enthroned as the Paschal Lamb, but He went to Heaven with His wounds still fresh (John 20:27), not with His wounds healed, because God's people have not stopped sinning. He still looks like a slain Lamb because He continually offers His crucified Body and Blood (the Passover Lamb) to God the Father, during every celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), in atonement for our sins (Hebrews 7:25).
During Mass, when the Priest lifts up the bread & wine together (the Body of Christ) to invite the congregation to the marriage feast of the Lamb, at this point the bread & wine is the resurrected Lamb of God, standing as if slain, with His fresh wounds.

*Seven horns and seven eyes; these are the Seven spirits of God sent out into the whole world.*
Christ has the fullness of power (horns) and knowledge (eyes) (Zechariah 4:10) and His Spirits have been sent out to all the Parishes of the Church all over the world, not only the 7 Parishes which He addressed in chapters 2 & 3.
This is the daily scenario in Heaven and is the same scenario on earth when God's Kingdom comes down on earth during the Liturgical service (Mass) in Church, and Heaven and earth resound together in praising and worshipping God.

*Then one of the elders said to me, ‚ÄúDo not weep. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, has conquered." Then I saw a Lamb standing as if it had been slaughtered.*
The ‚ÄúLion‚Äù is a ‚ÄúLamb‚Äù and it has conquered by being slaughtered.
Jesus didn't conquer the world's greatest enemy (Satan) with worldly weapons and violence. Jesus conquered Satan by rejecting Satan's offers on how to save His Body from suffering, and chose to suffer by humbling Himself like a lamb.
Satan comes to each of us too, in many different ways, with his juicy offers.
But like Jesus, we too must conquer Satan by dying to the comfort and pleasures and ways of this world, so that we may rise with Jesus.

Revelation 5:7
During every Mass the Priest (the representative of Christ) unlocks the Bible to read the Word of God.

Revelation 5:8
These are the prayers/petitions of the saints/holy ones on earth, which are offered up to God through Jesus, every Sunday, after the Priest delivers the sermon/homily. These also include our personal petitions.
These prayers are received by the 24 elders/priests (the Patriarchs of the 12 tribes and the 12 the Apostles) in Heaven (Psalm 141:1; Tobit 12:12).

These prayers are sent up to God because we are part of the Communion of Saints in Heaven through baptism. We encounter many obstacles in our daily lives which make it difficult for us to accomplish our mission on earth and remain holy, due to the damaged nature of our souls and because we are still in the flesh.
These prayers include general needs of the Church community, the public authorities, the oppressed, etc., whatever could be a possible obstacle in maintaining the holiness of the Church.

Do the Saints Pray for Us?
We may infer from the fact that the saints are in heaven that they would pray for us. Being in heaven means being united with God, who is love (1 John 4:8-9, 16). When united with God, we will be transformed to be like him (Rom. 8:29; 1 Cor. 15:49-52; 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Pet. 1:4; 1 John 3:2), for ‚Äúnothing unclean shall enter‚Äù the heavenly city (Rev. 21:27).
Being thus transformed by the love of God, the saints are filled with love and so care about others. It is natural when you care about someone to pray to God for that person. We can thus infer that, just as God loves us and provides for us, the saints love and pray for those on earth.

Revelation 5:9-10
Jesus is the new Israel and those who are baptized into His Body are priests in the kingdom of the new Israel, some common and some ordained.

*You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God.*
The duty of a priest is to serve God by offering sacrifices. While the ordained priests are permitted to offer the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the divine Son of God, we, the common priests, can offer our bodies, in union with Christ, so that God can use us for the growth of His Kingdom.

Revelation 5:11-14
In Heaven the angels and saints enjoy worshipping God continuously (Revelation 4:8) because they are in supreme communion with God, but on earth God has commanded us to worship Him in His House (the Church) at least once a week because our sinful bodies make it difficult for us to enjoy spending even one hour with God, while the same bodies will not have any problem spending endless hours with worldly distractions and worldly activities.

Then all Heaven and earth joins together with loud voices to sing with one accord the Great ‚ÄúAmen". On earth we sing this Great ‚ÄúAmen" at the end of the Eucharistic liturgy. Thereafter Jesus makes the atonement for our sins (Hebrews 7:25). In Heaven there is no atonement for sins but the angels and saints rejoice while they sing along with us because we (the bride) have now been purified (covered with while robes) and made ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb (to receive Communion).

When we give a positive response to the Word of God (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ) we are swearing that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7). Doing otherwise is disobedience and therefore sinful.

Titus 1:5-9
Paul was advising Titus to anoint more men to serve as bishops/overseers, priests/presbyters and deacons/helpers in the new Churches/Parishes. Anointed priests and bishops would be the successors of the Apostles, ensuring that the Church's ‚Äúdominion continued through all generations‚Äù (Philippians 1:1).

Paul applied the teaching of Jesus (Luke 17: 1-6) to Titus, who was Paul's spiritual child and the Bishop of Crete. Paul had instructed Titus to appoint in every town, blameless men to serve the Lord as priests, but before judging their character, Titus, as the Bishop of the Church, had to ensure that he himself was blameless, clean of character, holy and spreading the message of Christ to all.

*But why did Paul give all these instructions to Titus?*
Paul gave all these instructions to Titus because Paul knew that the Church was not going to be free of the spirit of Judas.
Paul also knew that it would be easy to find qualified men to serve as priests and bishops, but they would not be blameless men, they would be proud, arrogant, irritable, etc., and they would eventually be involved in corruption and scandals. Therefore, Paul cautioned Titus that when he appointed bishops and priests, he must appoint men who would pursue holiness, men who would be righteous and holy spiritual fathers.

##### Judgment and Repentance

##### Day 361: A second chance

We listened to the letter of St Paul to Philemon today and it‚Äôs a very short book it has just one chapter. Most of the chapter is written about Onesimus, St Paul is asking Philemon to give Onesimus a second chance in life.
Philemon was a wealthy Chritian and a just man. Onesimus was his slave, remember slavery wasn‚Äôt forced but mutually accepted back in the day just like our modern day job contract. Onesimus was probably a useless slave and possibly did something wrong to Philemon or did not fulfill his duties. It‚Äôs possible that Philemon sent him to jail or the Onesimus ran away and got into trouble, for our context it really does not matter.
Onesimus encountered Paul in the prison and received the gospel, he then became very helpful to Paul. In the letter to Philemon we read that Paul wanted to keep Onesimus with him as he was a great help in Paul‚Äôs old age, however Paul wanted to send him back to Philemon so Onesimus can fulfil his duty and be justified fully. Let us read the section of this letter as it‚Äôs beautifully written.

For I have experienced much joy and encouragement\* from your love, because the hearts of the holy ones have been refreshed by you, brother.
Therefore, although I have the full right\* in Christ to order you to do what is proper,
I rather urge you out of love, being as I am, Paul, an old man,\* and now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus. I urge you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become in my imprisonment, who was once useless to you but is now useful\* to \[both\] you and me.
I am sending him, that is, my own heart, back to you.
I should have liked to retain him for myself, so that he might serve\* me on your behalf in my imprisonment for the gospel,
but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that the good you do might not be forced but voluntary.
Perhaps this is why he was away from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a brother, beloved especially to me, but even more so to you, as a man\* and in the Lord.
So if you regard me as a partner, welcome him as you would me.
And if he has done you any injustice or owes you anything, charge it to me.
I, Paul, write this in my own hand: I will pay. May I not tell you that you owe me your very self.
Yes, brother, may I profit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
With trust in your compliance I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
At the same time prepare a guest room for me, for I hope to be granted to you through your prayers. Philemon 1: 7-22
I wish and hope that everyone who needs a second chance in life finds a St Paul to lead and guide them. Also we should never write off anyone, but always know that Jesus can change their lives in ways we least expect it. Even if they are in jail like Onesimus there is still a chance that they can convert their lives, the gospel is not bound. Also we should pray for those involved in prison ministry, that they may have the patience and strength to minister to the inmates. Remember Jesus‚Äô words in Mat 25:36 "I was in prison, and you came to me". Giving someone a second chance is really hard especially if they hurt us, we cannot rely on our own strength here but only on God‚Äôs grace. Forgiving close family members like a spouse, parent or child is extremely difficult but pray and give them a second chance not just once but 70 times 7.

May the Holy Spirit lead us

##### The Woman Clothed with the Sun

[![The Woman Clothed with the Sun](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day362.jpg)](https://youtu.be/2l0Q9gjHrqk "The Woman Clothed with the Sun")

##### BIAY Day 362 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 12:1
*A great sign appeared in the sky; a woman clothed with the sun.*
The woman is the Church (Ephesians 5:22-24) besieged by Satan but preserved in safety by God.
The woman is daughter Zion who brought forth Israel‚Äôs Messiah.
The woman is the new Eve (Mary).

*A woman clothed with the sun.*
The sun in John‚Äôs vision was the Holy Spirit who overshadowed Mary since the time of the incarnation (Luke 1:35) and likewise overshadows the Church.
In the old Covenant, the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit was symbolized by covering the Ark with pure gold (Exodus 25:11).
The Ark of the old Covenant was a box. It was a shadow of Mary and a symbol of the Church.
The Ark of the new Covenant is a woman, the Mother of our Lord.

*..... with the moon under her feet,.....*
This woman is in Heaven.
\*......... and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
This woman is the queen.
Mary and the Church are the fulfillment of the promise which God had made in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15).
John does not refer to the "woman" as ‚Äúsoul‚Äù because she was taken to Heaven body and soul, whereas John refers to the martyrs as souls (Revelation 6:9).
When John saw this vision, Mary had already left this world, even before the destruction of the Temple in AD 70, so she was already in Heaven.

‚ÄúRahem‚Äù (in Hebrew/Aramaic) means ‚Äúmercy‚Äù as well as ‚Äúwomb.‚Äù
God's mercy for the world came through the womb of Mary.
As commanded by God, before the Babylonian attack (Jeremiah 20:4), the Ark of the Covenant, the Tent and the Altar of incense were hidden by prophet Jeremiah in a cave and were to be revealed only after God would gather His people together and show His mercy (2 Maccabees 2:4-7). Thereafter, the Temple was desolate because the Ark was not in the Temple (Matthew 23:38).

Revelation 12:3
The dragon is represented by the evil and corrupt rulers of the evil empires.

Revelation 12:4
These stars are the angels who obeyed Satan and followed him and were therefore all cast out of heaven.
The devil will succeed in misleading one-third of the Christians to follow him.

*One third of the stars..‚Ä¶*
Why only one-third ?
It is believed that one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Father, one-third of the angels were to worship and serve God the Son, and one-third of the angels were to worship and serve the Holy Spirit.
All 3 groups of angels have a superior angel and Lucifer/Satan was one of them.

Angels are on a higher level than humans. They are pure spirits. They have free will but they do not have the option of repentance because they have full knowledge of everything, including the consequences of their actions. Their knowledge is not limited like humans. Therefore they can only obey or disobey and their will is irrevocable.

*Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, to devour her child when she gave birth.*
Satan was waiting for a chance to destroy Jesus after his birth.
According to the prophecy of Daniel, Satan (the dragon) had some knowledge, though not exact, regarding the timeline when the Messiah would be born, and Satan was aware that he would be destroyed by the Messiah sent by God as prophesied by God (Genesis 3:15). But being a spirit, Satan needed the body of a greedy, selfish, rich, evil and powerful ruler, who serves him, to carry out his mission. He therefore united himself to king Herod who perfectly met Satan‚Äôs criteria, because Herod was ambitious, paranoid and so possessive with regard to the throne that he had killed his own family members (one wife and sons) who, according to Herod, were seeking to snatch the throne from him.
Satan (the dragon) also joined himself later to the evil rulers who persecuted the infant Church (the Body of Christ) and tried to destroy it, though without success.

Revelation 12:13
Satan went after the woman because he hates the new Woman. Why?
Satan succeeded in tricking the first Woman to poison the first Adam to bring eternal death to God's people, but he didn't succeed in tricking the new Woman / the new Eve and therefore she gave life to the new Adam (Jesus), who is able to give God's new people eternal life because of the new Woman / the new Eve / Mary the Mother of Jesus, and Jesus will eventually destroy Satan.

Revelation 12:14
‚ÄúGreat eagle‚Äù is a symbol of the power and swiftness of divine help (Psalm 91:4; Exodus 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Isaiah 40:31).
God protected the infant Church during the persecution by Nero, who ruled for three and a half years.
God also provided divine assistance when the Church went underground for three and a half centuries, the guarantee which He had given in the Old Covenant (Genesis 3:15). In the New Covenant Jesus confirmed the guarantee of the same divine assistance (Mathew 16:18), because the celebration of the new Passover (Mass) must go on until the end of time.

Revelation 12:17
If the devil has been constantly throwing major problems in our lap then we must rejoice that we have been counted by God as worthy to be called the children of our heavenly mother Mary because she will be our mother willingly only if we are obeying her Son (John 2:5).
The dragon was angry with the woman because he did not succeed in deceiving her either before she gave birth to the Redeemer or after.
The dragon makes war on the rest of her children because Jesus gave His mother to them as their spiritual mother (John 19:26-27) to feed them, nurture them and raise them as children who are pleasing to God the Father, just as she raised her own Son (Matthew 3:17; 17:5). This is her task as Queen Mother until the end of time. It is her duty to form us into saints in union with her spouse, the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:31-35 & 38).

Revelation 13:1
Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with ten horns (power) and seven heads; on its horns were ten diadems (monarchy), and on its heads blasphemous names.
horns = power;
diadems = monarchy.
The first beast, symbolizing the pagan Roman empire or its evil and corrupt rulers, becomes the dragon‚Äôs agent.
Domitian, like Antiochus IV Epiphanes (Dn 7:8, 11, 25), demanded that he be called by divine titles such as ‚Äúour lord and god‚Äù (blasphemous name).
Most of the Roman emperors made the same demand.
The future first beast can be any similar evil, corrupt & powerful political authority.

Revelation 13:11
The second beast tries to look like *the Lamb* (of God) to deceive God‚Äôs people (Matthew 24:5).
The second beast arises from the land, symbolizing the anti-Christ or evil and corrupt religious authority, which leads people astray, by deception, to worship the first beast (Rev 13:11‚Äì18).
The religious authorities in the first century AD led the Jews astray by giving glory to Emperor Caesar (John 19:15).
The future second beast can be any corrupt religious authority.

Revelation 13:13
The second beast raises up false prophets who deceive the people into following their teaching by performing miracles to lure the people towards them.
We have already been warned by Moses, Jesus and Paul to be aware and beware of the false prophets (Deut. 13:1‚Äì4; Mathew 24:24; 2 Thess. 2:9‚Äì10).

Revelation 13:18
666, refers to humanity, created on the sixth day and brought into covenant with God on the seventh day, which God blessed as the Sabbath.
The early Christians referred to the evil and cruel emperors as the ‚Äúanti-Christs‚Äù (1 John 2:18-22; 4:3; 2 John 1:7) therefore John had to be careful when referring to any of them.
Caesar Nero was one of the emperors who viciously persecuted the Church. Christians had either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom. Peter and Paul were executed during the rule of Nero, before the destruction of the Temple.
The consonants in Nero's name add up to 666.
The only other time the number 666 appears in the Bible is when Solomon turned away from God and started multiplying his wealth, women and weapons (1 Kings 10:14).
Therefore the final beast would probably be a combination of Solomon and Nero; In other words, the final beast (or anti-Christ) would be an evil, rich, womanizing, powerful and cruel ruler who will viciously persecute the Christians.

The number 666 is what ‚ÄúNero Caesar‚Äù (NRWN QSR) adds up to in Hebrew and Aramaic according to the numerical values the letters have in these languages (N+R+W+N+Q+S+R = 50+200+6+50+100+60+200 = 666).

However, as long as we receive the Body of Christ / Holy Eucharist (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27) every Sunday and obey God‚Äôs commandments at all times, we will be covered by the Blood of the Lamb and Satan will not be able to destroy our souls, even if he succeeds in destroying our bodies.
Therefore let us stop worrying about the anti-Christ and focus more on the living Christ.

Revelation 14:1
In the old Covenant, the ordained Jewish priests had only the Father's name on their foreheads (Exodus 28:36-38; Exodus 29:6).
In the new Covenant, the Christian priests have the Father's and Son's name on their foreheads by virtue of their baptism.

Revelation 14:4-5
*It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins;*
These are the celibate priests who served God faithfully without getting involved with idolatory of any kind. Therefore they were pure in body and soul.

*............ these follow the Lamb wherever he goes.*
They followed the Passover Lamb (Jesus) because wherever there is a Tabernacle there is an Apostolic priest.

*........... and in their mouth no lie was found; they are blameless.*
These are the godly priests who have abstained from women and who have preached the true Word of God and brought many people close to God (Malachi 2:4-7).

Revelation 14:12
In addition to faith in Jesus, Jesus insists upon the necessity and value of ‚Äúgood works‚Äù and obedience to God‚Äôs commandments even in the face of a crisis or any negative situation (Revelation 2:23; 20:12‚Äì13; 22:12; Mathew 16:27; Romans 2:6).

Revelation 14:13
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the Spirit, ‚Äúlet them find rest from their labors, for their works accompany them.‚Äù
We will be judged by our faith and works, and when we enter into God's eternal rest we will rest from our works, because "entering into God's rest" means "our faith has been tested and we have proved our faith by our works" (Hebrews 4:10).

Hebrews 1:14
Christ is the centre of the angelic world. They are His angels (Matthew 25:31).
They belong to Him because they were created through and for Him (Colossians 1:16) and specially because he has made them the messengers of his saving plan.

In the old Covenant, angels have been present since the beginning of creation and throughout the history of salvation, announcing this salvation from far or near and serving the accomplishment of the divine plan:

1. they closed the earthly paradise (Genesis 3:24);
2. they protected Lot (Genesis 19:15);
3. they saved Hagar and her child (Genesis 21:17);
4. they stayed Abraham's hand (Genesis 22:11);
5. they communicated the law by their ministry (Acts 7:53);
6. they led the People of God (Exodus 23:20-22);
7. they announced births and callings (Judges 13:3; 6:11-24);
8. they assisted the prophets (Isaiah 6:6; 1 Kings 19:5);
9. Angel Gabriel announced the birth of the fore runner and of Jesus Himself (Luke 1:11 & 26).

In the new Covenant, from the Incarnation to the Ascension, the life of the Word incarnate (Jesus) is surrounded by the adoration and service of angels:

1. When God "brought the firstborn into the world, He said, ‚ÄúLet all God's angels worship Him‚Äù (Hebrews 1:6.); thereafter their song of praise at the birth of Christ has not ceased resounding in the Church's praise, "Glory to God in the highest" (Luke 2:14);
2. They saved Jesus and His mother from being deserted by Joseph (Matthew 1:20).
3. They protected Jesus in his infancy (Matthew 2:13 & 19-20);
4. They served him in the desert (Matthew 4:11; Mark 1:13);
5. They strengthened him while He was going through agony in the garden (Luke 22:43), when he could have been saved by them from the hands of his enemies (Matthew 26:53) as Israel had been saved (2 Maccabees 10:29-30; 11:8).
6. It was the angels who "evangelized" by proclaiming the Good News of Christ's Incarnation and Resurrection (Luke 2:8-14; Mark 16:5-7).
   They will be present at Christ's return, which they will announce, to serve at his Judgement (Matthew 13:41-42; 24:31; Luke 12:8-9; Acts 1:10-11).
   (CCC 331-336)

Hebrews 3:7-8
Whenever we harden our hearts (resist God by committing sins), like those Israelites, we break the Covenant with God and automatically move into a Covenant with Satan. God is calling us to repent and renew our Covenant with Him regularly so that we can be in a Covenant relation with Him (state of grace) every day, and if we die today we can directly enter into our eternal rest.
God lives outside of time, so for Him the Covenant was made through Jesus ‚Äútoday‚Äù and we belong to His Covenant family through baptism.

The two most important moments in our lives are:
(1) now, and
(2) at the hour of our death.

Let us therefore focus on God's Will and obey His commandments every moment of our present time so that we may remain strong in our faith until the hour of our death.

Hebrews 4:1-8
Here the author speaks of two types of spiritual rests.

One rest is when God rested on the seventh day from all His works after the creation of the world, and God invited humanity to join Him in that rest every Sabbath as a symbol of their eternal rest.

The second rest is the rest of the earthly promised land, which was a symbol of our heavenly promised land. The earthly promised land was a physical place where the people could enter and have peace and safety if they obeyed God. But the people of Israel sinned terribly, generation after generation, starting from the first generation of adults who passed through the Red Sea. The Israelites never fully embraced the Covenant laws and therefore never enjoyed the promised peace and rest.

Like the Israelites, we too have been promised that same peace and rest till we reach our heavenly promised land if we obey God‚Äôs commandments and the teachings of Christ. But we are on a better level than those ancient people, because in baptism Jesus gave us the Holy Spirit to help us enjoy that peace and rest on earth without struggling with our human efforts. We just need to detach ourselves from the world, surrender ourselves to the Lord, listen to the voice of the Holy Spirit, and spend moments of silence in solitude with the Holy Spirit without resisting the working of the Spirit in our lives so that we can have that peaceful relationship with God, the same bliss which was enjoyed by Adam & Eve in the Garden of Eden before the fall.

Hebrews 4:9-10
The seventh day Sabbath rest (Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8-9) was to be a shadow of the Eternal rest for God‚Äôs people (Hebrews 4:9). In the old Covenant it was Saturday, whereas in the new Covenant it is Sunday.

After completing His work of the first creation, God rested on the seventh day of the week (the Sabbath), blessed it and made it holy (Genesis 2:2-3). It was supposed to be an everlasting Sabbath until sin entered the world.
Therefore, after the completion of His work for the salvation of mankind, Jesus (the first Adam) rested in the tomb on Holy Saturday, the seventh day of the week, in accordance with the Jewish Sabbath.
His Sabbath rest indicated the end of the first / old creation.
The Resurrection of Jesus (the new Adam) on the first day of the week was the beginning of the new creation which has no end.
(CCC 624)

##### The New Covenant Priesthood

[![The New Covenant Priesthood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/December/jpgs/Day363.jpg)](https://youtu.be/oX1MJT0iXpc "The New Covenant Priesthood")

##### BIAY Day 363 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 15:2
*And I saw......... those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name.*

Those who had conquered the beast were the martyrs.
The martyrs are shown as victorious even though the beast succeeded in killing them on earth because the beast succeeded in destroying their bodies but not their souls. The beast wanted them to deny Jesus / disobey God to save their bodies but they refused until their death.
Spiritual victory is not the same as physical victory.

Revelation 16:1-17
The seven angels poured the wine of God‚Äôs fury as destructive libations on those who rejected the Blood of the Covenant (the Blood of Christ), as opposed to the atoning libations (the Blood of Christ) offered to God during Mass by the priests.

In the New Covenant, as in the Old, God has given us a choice between eternal life and eternal death. To reject the Blood of the new Covenant (the Blood of Christ) is to choose death (Hebrews 10:29).

During every Mass, when we hear the Priest repeat the words of institution, ‚Äúthis is the Chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting Covenant‚Äù we must recall the judgement of the Apocalypse.
During every Mass, we stand before the judgement seat when we bind ourselves to the Covenant.
During every Mass, we receive the Chalice either for our salvation or for our judgement (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Revelation 16:14
*These were demonic spirits who performed signs. They went out to the kings of the whole world to assemble them for the battle on the great day of God the almighty.*

The evil spirits will go out into the world to prepare the kings for world war. But simultaneously, there is also a spiritual war going on in the spiritual realm between the good spirits and the evil spirits (Revelation 12:7) which is reflected by war on the earth between humans.

At the beginning of the Bible, after Adam and Eve chose to make a Covenant with Satan, Satan used one man (Cain) to kill his own brother, which was the result of pride.

At the end if the Bible Satan has succeeded in stirring up the pride of billions of humans to kill each other.

Instead of using money to feed the poor and needy, pride has led humans to use that same money to buy weapons to kill each other.
When man has too many material conditions for happiness, he multiplies wars.

Revelation 17:1 & 15
*The great harlot who lives near the many waters.*
The ‚Äúgreat harlot‚Äù could have been pagan Rome, who led people astray into idolatry and immoral lifestyle, the population of Rome being a mixture of many nationalities (many waters).

Revelation 17:2
*The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the inhabitants of the earth became drunk on the wine of her harlotry.*
The pagan kings of Israel (example: Herod), subject to pagan Rome, adopted the cult of the emperors and led the people of Israel astray into idolatry and immoral lifestyle. Therefore Jerusalem and Judah were also referred to as a ‚Äúharlot‚Äù (Ezekiel 16:2-63; Jeremiah 2:20; 3:3; Isaiah 1:21).

Revelation 17:6
*The woman was drunk on the blood of the holy ones and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.*
Persecution of the Apostles and the faithful Christians by the Romans.

Revelation 17:9-10
*The seven heads represent seven hills upon which the woman is seated. They also represent seven kings. Five have already fallen, one still lives, and the last has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a short while.*
Rome is only one of the cities in the world which sits on seven hills but so does Athens, Jerusalem, San Francisco and Cincinnati.

Rome is built on seven hills. During the time of John, the currency coins used by pagan Rome were embossed with a lady sitting on seven hills, so the first century Jewish Christians knew exactly who John was referring to.

According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the five kings who had fallen were the deceased emperors of the Caesarean dynasty of Rome (Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius I, Caligula and Claudius). Emperor Nero Caesar, the sixth, was the one who was ruling (AD 54 to 68). The next emperor, who was not yet crowned, would be Galba, the seventh one, who would last for only one year (AD 68 to 69).

Hebrews 5:1-4
This law applies to all priests of the old as well as the new Covenants.
Much emphasis is put on the High Priest because the letters to the Hebrews were written when the High Priest of the old Covenant was still functioning in the Jerusalem Temple even after the old priesthood was handed over to Jesus and the new priesthood had started functioning in the Church.
The High Priest of the old Covenant was therefore, at that point, a religious danger to the Jewish Christians who were confused between the two priesthoods. Due to this confusion the Jewish Christians continued following the Mosaic law faithfully and offering animal sacrifices while they also attended the liturgical services in the Church and offered the sacrifice of the Lamb of God.

Thus, they were taking part in the sacrificial meals of the Temple as well as of the Church.

A Priest does not take on his priestly role by choice, but only when called by God (John 15:16). Although all Christian men are called to be common priests, God calls certain men from among them for His special divine mission. However, our first universal calling happens when we are called by God to the grace of faith to receive the sacrament of Baptism. The calling for Priesthood is the second calling of selected men who must receive another sacrament, the sacrament of Holy Orders.

Just as Aaron, in the old Covenant, did not take the honor upon himself when he was appointed by God to be the earthly High Priest, similarly, Christ neither appointed Himself nor did He exalt Himself when He was appointed by God to be the heavenly High Priest, because that was a calling from God, not the choice of Jesus.
The author of Hebrews was explaining to the people how it was possible for Jesus to be designated as a heavenly High Priest even though He did not meet any of the criteria of an earthly High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16).

Every High Priest has the principal function of acting as a sacrificial mediator between God and His people. The role of the High Priest is:
a) to act on behalf of God‚Äôs people,
b) to speak to God on behalf of God‚Äôs people,
c) to plead for forgiveness from God on behalf of God‚Äôs people, and.
d) to offer sacrifices on behalf of God‚Äôs people in atonement for their sins, which is meant to reconcile God‚Äôs people to God.
The earthly High Priest was able to understand / sympathize with the people because he himself was subject to weakness of the soul (a sinner) like God‚Äôs people. Therefore, the High Priest was above the people in his role as mediator, but he was also part of the same people as a sinner.

In the old Covenant, the ordained priest offered the sacrifice of an earthly lamb on behalf of the consecrated common priests (the congregation) who took part in the worship in union with the ordained priest and thereafter they shared in the sacrificial meal (the earthly lamb) for their physical nourishment.
In the new Covenant, the ordained priest offers the sacrifice of the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) on behalf of the baptismal common priests (the congregation) who take part in the worship in union with the ordained priest and thereafter they share in the heavenly sacrificial meal (the Bread of eternal life / Communion) for their spiritual nourishment.

God wanted Israel to be a nation of common priests (Exodus 19:6) but this didn‚Äôt happen in the new Covenant because majority of Israel rejected Jesus.

By virtue of their baptism, Christians have a share in Christ‚Äôs common priesthood
This is commonly referred to as ‚Äúthe common priesthood of all the faithful.‚Äù
However, certain members of the faithful are ordained to a greater participation in Christ‚Äôs priesthood to serve as ministerial priests / by the Sacrament of Holy Orders. This is known as the ministerial priesthood.
Christ, the source of the common and ministerial priesthoods, is our High Priest

The Church thus understands there to be a threefold structure of the priesthood:

1. the common priesthood of all Christians (1 Peter 2:9);
2. the ministerial priesthood of the ordained (Romans 15:16; Acts 14:23; 1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:5; James 5:14); and
3. the high priesthood of Christ (Hebrews 3:1, 4:14‚Äì15, 5:5, 6:20, and 9:11).
   It was the same pattern in the Old Covenant.
   There was a common priesthood of the Israelites made up of the head of every household, a ministerial priesthood from the sons of Aaron (Exod. 28:1), with Aaron as the high priest (Ezra 7:5).

The ordained ministry or the ministerial priesthood is at the service of the baptismal priesthood. Christ the Lord, High Priest who was taken from among men, (Heb. 5:1-5) made the new people (the Christians) "a kingdom of common priests to God the Father" (Rev. 6:1; 5:9-10).

Hebrews 5:5-6
*Christ was appointed by the One who said to him, ‚ÄúYou are my Son, today I have begotten you‚Äù; as he says also in another place, ‚ÄúYou are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.‚Äù*

To be God's son is to be a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek. That is why only men are called to be the anointed/ordained priests. And that is why Jesus chose only men to be His Apostles, His future priests, even though He had many female disciples.

To be a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek means to have a clean priesthood where there is no bloodshed, and to offer bread and wine to God in thanksgiving.
It is the same in the New Covenant.

In between, the Levitical priesthood was a priesthood where the offerings involved a lot of bloodshed (of animals) because of the sin of the Golden Calf.
But Melchizedek‚Äôs offering was an incomplete offering.
Jesus became a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, in the Upper Room, when He made a complete offering of bread and wine in thanksgiving as well as in atonement for the sins of God‚Äôs people.

Hebrews 7:23-24
*The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office; but Jesus holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.*

How does the priesthood of Jesus remain forever ?

When the New Covenant priests repeat the words of consecration, Jesus takes the gifts/offerings (bread and wine) from the earthly priests, transforms them into His Body and Blood and offers them to God the Father in the Holy of Holies (Holy Sanctuary), in atonement for the sins of the Priest and his congregation (Hebrews 7:25). Thereafter God the Father blesses the gifts/offerings and returns them to the Priest as the resurrected Body of Christ (the new Passover Lamb) which the people must consume as their sacrificial meal (Communion). Thus, with His holy and acceptable offering Jesus, the High Priest, is able to purify the worshipers and bring them closer to God.

And as long as there are priests on earth, Jesus will be performing His priestly duty by continually offering Himself to the Father, to purify God‚Äôs people and bring them closer to God. Therefore the celebration of the Eucharist (Mass) must go on until the end of time (Exodus 12:14, 17 & 24).

Hebrews 7:25
*Consequently he is able for all time to save those who approach God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.*
Jesus intercedes for us continuously by offering the sacramental sacrifice in Heaven whenever it is offered on the earth, the same sacrifice which He offered in the Upper Room.

When does Jesus make this intercession for us?
Jesus intercedes for us during the Mass and even when we generally pray to God through Jesus, outside the Mass.

Hebrews 8:12
God will not remember our sins which have been forgiven by His priests, but the sins which are not confessed and those which are not forgiven ((John 20:23)), till we die, will be remembered on Judgment Day.

##### Christ's Sacrifice Once for All

##### BIAY Day 364 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 18:4
*Then I heard another voice from heaven say, ‚ÄúDepart from her, my people, so as not to take part in her sins and receive a share in her plagues.‚Äù*

This is a command for God‚Äôs people to separate themselves from the sinners, and not for evacuation of the city.
God wanted the faithful Christians to leave Rome for their safety and also so that they do not fall into sin by following the pagan worship and lifestyle. Because of the severe persecution of the Christians during this time, the Christians fled from Rome, settled in other countries around Rome and started evangelizing the people there. Thus Christianity spread to the whole of Europe.

God allowed the persecution to move the Christians from their comfort zones and do their duty of evangelizing the world, which would not have happened if they continued to live comfortably in Rome.

This can happen to anyone of us if God wants us to go on a mission to places we would never have thought of.

When the Christians moved out, Rome was then left with only the wicked ones who brought destruction on themselves.

Revelation 18:8
*Therefore, her plagues will come in one day, pestilence, grief, and famine; she will be consumed by fire. For mighty is the Lord God who judges her.*

The Babylon referred to in this chapter could be Jerusalem (as some scholars believe), because Rome had completely destroyed Jerusalem by burning the city, in 70 AD, and according to the book of Ezekiel, the curse of the Covenant was to come upon Jerusalem. We see the curse fulfilled in this book with famine, pestilence, strife (Revelation 6:2-8) and the seven angelic trumpets.
These calamities, which took place during the destruction of the Temple, were recorded by Josephus (the Jewish historian).
During this time not a single Christian perished because they had fled to the mountains across Jordan to a place called Pella, as commanded by Jesus (Mathew 24:15-16).

After the destruction of the Temple, a few houses and the Upper Room had, however, survived the destruction, and around 130 AD, as reported by St. Epiphanius, the Christians who returned to Jerusalem later, continued celebrating the new Passover / Eucharist in the Upper Room.
Why did God preserve the Upper Room ?
According to Tradition, this was the place where Jesus had instituted the Eucharist, and the spot where the Holy Spirit had descended on the Apostles, Mary and the other disciples, on Pentecost Sunday. It was the place where the first Christians were nourished during the spiritual famine, and where they were sealed by the Spirit for safety in the forthcoming destruction. The Upper Room is situated on Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, which was the capital city of the earthly Davidic kingdom.

Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6.
Hallel-u-yah means "Praise the Lord."
This frequent exclamation of praise in the Hebrew Psalms was important in Jewish liturgy and has been adopted by the Church as well.

Revelation 19:7-9
*Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory, for the wedding day of the Lamb has come, his bride has made herself ready. She was allowed to wear a bright, clean linen garment.‚Äù (The linen represents the righteous deeds of the holy ones.) Then the angel said to me, ‚ÄúWrite this: Blessed are those who have been called to the marriage feast of the Lamb.‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúThese words are true; they come from God.‚Äù*
During the liturgical service of the new Passover / Mass, through the power of the Holy Spirit, atonement has been made by Jesus (Hebrews 7:25), on behalf of His priests, for the forgiven sins of the bride of Christ (the Priest and the congregation) and thus she has purified herself and made herself ready for the marriage feast of the Lamb. Her good works go along with her.

The spotless bride (the community of saints) is, therefore, now being invited to take part in the marriage feast of the Lamb, to unite with her Groom (Jesus) by receiving the Body of Christ (John 6:54) since she is already in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).
At this point the priest raises the living Body of Christ and officially invites the purified congregation to share in the heavenly meal, by saying:
"Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29), Blessed are those who have been called to the supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:9)."
This is the climax of the worship.

The words of invitation (Revelation 19:9) come from God through His anointed priests.
Our earthly marriages reflect the spiritual marriage between Jesus and His bride. We must, therefore, always respect the sanctity of marriage (Hebrews 13:4).

The nuptial union takes place when we receive the Body of Christ (our heavenly Groom) on our tongue and therefore we surrender and subject ourselves to Him (Ephesians 5:22-24). The bride (the community of saints) must, therefore, always go forward to the Altar, with humility, to receive her groom (Jesus).

When Jesus comes at the end of time, the saints of the Church will be going marching with Him to Heaven, in the same manner, to receive Him in person and take part in the heavenly wedding feast in Heaven.

Thus, the Bible begins in Genesis with a marriage between Adam (the son of God) and his bride (Eve), and ends in Revelation with a marriage between Jesus (the Son of God) and His bride (the new Eve / Mary and the saints of the Church).

Revelation 19:15
*Out of his mouth came a sharp sword to strike the nations.*
Jesus will conquer the nations by preaching the Word of God. It is a heavenly weapon, not an earthly one. Therefore, the sword is not in His hand but in His mouth.

Revelation 20:1-4
*Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, and threw him into the pit, and locked and sealed it over him, so that he would deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were ended.*
The binding of Satan‚Äôs army started when Jesus, during His Ministry, started releasing the people of the bigger demons which no one could bind (Matthew 12:29; Mark 3:27).
By His crucifixion and death, Jesus finally destroyed the power of Satan over humanity (locked Satan inside the pit). The saving power of Jesus, however, applies to us only when we are baptized and, thereafter, Jesus protects us from Satan when we receive the sacraments (1 John 5:18; Mark 3:27; John 12:31-32).
That is why, whenever we release Satan from the lockup with our mortal sins, we need the sacraments to release our souls from his clutches.

On the other hand, when Christians live in total obedience to God they contribute to the sanctification of the world and the glorification of God (Matthew 5:16).

Hebrews 9:11-12
In Christ‚Äôs fulfillment of the Old Covenant sacrifices, Jesus‚Äôs sacrifice didn‚Äôt begin and end on Calvary, nor did it end with his glorious Resurrection, which is why He told Mary Magdalene not to cling to Him because He had not yet ascended to his Father in heaven (John 20:17), to complete the sacrificial ritual. There was something more for Jesus to do to complete His one sacrifice.

Unlike the earthly high priests, Jesus ascended to a Heavenly Sanctuary, not made by hands, and brought His own sinless blood to God to obtain eternal redemption once for all (Hebrews 9:11-12), to appear in the presence of God and reconcile the people to God, and thereafter celebrate the Day of Atonement of the new Covenant with the angels and saints in the true Holy of Holies, thereby terminating the Day of Atonement of the Old Covenant. Thus the one-time sacrifice of Jesus, which started in the Upper Room, was completed only in the Heavenly Sanctuary after His Ascension.

Hebrews 9:22
*According to the law almost everything is purified by blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.*
Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins because sin is in our blood.
The duty of a priest is therefore to reconcile sinners to God by pouring out the divine blood (the consecrated wine) which was given to us to make atonement for our sins (Luke 22:19-20; 1 Corinthians 11:25).
When we break our Covenant with God, it is not enough to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and close the chapter. We must offer holy blood to God to repair the damage and the only blood acceptable to God is the Blood of Christ.

If sin is debt then the Blood of Christ is credit.
Jesus paid a debt He did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay.
This verse is written in the present tense because it is valid until the end of time.

Hebrews 10:9-10
*He abolishes the first in order to establish the second. And it is by God‚Äôs will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.*

In the old Covenant, the earthly lambs had to be slaughtered and offered daily or monthly or yearly because, although those lambs were without physical blemish, they died after being slaughtered. Therefore, the priests and their congregation could not receive divine life after eating the sacrificial meals.

But that was just a shadow of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) was slaughtered only once but this Lamb still lives and will live on forever even after being slaughtered because He was without spiritual blemish (sin). Therefore, the priests and their congregations can receive divine life after offering His body and blood and eating the sacrificial meal (the Body of Christ / Communion).

*And it is by God‚Äôs will that we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.*
The sacrifice of Jesus is like comprehensive insurance for our souls. Jesus has paid the advance price with His Blood therefore we don‚Äôt have to pay the price with our blood. So now whenever we become sick (with sins) we can go to our spiritual doctor (the priest) and tell him our symptoms (confession) and he will advise some lifestyle changes (penance). Thereafter, he will prepare the medicine (atonement with the Blood of Christ) so that our souls may be healed (purified).

Proverbs 31:28a
*Her children rise up and call her blessed.*
The godly woman described here is a mature mother of older children. ‚ÄúHer children rise up and call her blessed‚Äù. They recognize what a great job she has done.

*For what do they bless her?*

*The children bless their mother for raising godly children in an ungodly world.*
The true charm of this woman is her religious spirit and fear of God.
Proverbs was written during a different time in history and in a different land, yet we face similar challenges with marriage and family life.
During a much earlier period of history, Noah faced these challenges of an ungodly culture (Genesis 6:5, 11). God was ready to destroy everything, but Noah found favor with God. He was a righteous man, blameless in his generation (Genesis 6:8, 9). God had a plan to save him and his entire family. Noah‚Äôs wife believed God‚Äôs Word through her husband; she trusted his leadership. Together Noah and she had raised sons who also believed God‚Äôs Word through their father and helped him build the Ark. In that godless culture they chose wives who followed their lead, believing God‚Äôs Word through Noah. There was no spiritual leader to ask for advise, and there was no Bible to refer to.
Building the Ark was no simple task; it took decades. They had to gather the animals and supplies manually. People may have definitely mocked Noah and his family for believing and obeying God's Word.
The same is true even today, and like Noah, we may also be mocked for trying to raise godly children in an ungodly world.
We need to follow Noah‚Äôs example.
Husbands need to lead their families;
Wives need to trust the Lord to work through the spiritual leadership of their husbands;
Parents need to teach and help their children to pursue holiness, irrespective of their age, including choosing godly spouses for them;
And our families need to remain in the Ark of the Church (the barque of Peter), so that we are preserved from the floodwaters of wickedness that surround us.
Finally, we thank God for the salvation he has graciously provided, praying that others will open their hearts to the same grace.

*They bless their mother for their good family name.*
She contributes to a legacy:
"The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot" (Proverbs 10:7).
When a woman marries, she takes her husband‚Äôs family name as an expression of unity. She then contributes to the positive reputation of that name. The couple then gives their family name to their children and expects them to also contribute to the honor of the family name.
‚ÄúA good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold‚Äù (Proverbs 22:1).

*They bless their mother for her obedience of faith.*
As parents, our obedience or disobedience has a generational impact (Exodus20:5‚Äì6).
Likewise, our marriage is an ongoing source of strength for our children as they move from childhood to adulthood. Christian husbands and wives are ‚Äújoint heirs of the grace of life‚Äù (1 Peter 3:7). How we conduct ourselves in the vocation of marriage authenticates what we believe, especially in our expanding family. Imagine the gratitude of our adult children as they enter this vocation and discover its richness but also its challenges. How grateful they will be for our faithfulness!

*They bless their mother for her prayers for them.*
We pray for our adult children to be close to us emotionally and spiritually even when they are not close to us geographically. Time and space are our boundaries, not God‚Äôs. When older children live elsewhere, we can feel scattered. We gather them in our prayers, offering our Masses and rosaries for them and uniting our fasting and little mortifications with our petitions.
We imitate Jesus by interceding for our children, just as he lives to intercede for us (Hebrews 7:25).

We pray for our children‚Äôs safety from physical and spiritual harm, just as Job did. He rose early, every day, to pray for his adult children, that they might not sin grievously against the Lord (Job 1:5). His prayers formed a hedge of protection that only God could allow Satan to breach (Job 1:10).

We pray for a godly spouse from a godly family for each child called to marriage. It is not enough to raise a godly child; whom they marry is also critical. We also pray for the whole family into which our child will marry.
The parents who formed the spouses of our children will be ongoing influences. We pray that they will strengthen the couple and support them as they become parents themselves.

##### BIAY Day 365 By Cynthia Dsilva

Revelation 21:1
The ‚Äúnew heavens and the new earth‚Äù represent the transformed universe. Just as our bodies will be the same bodies which we have now, but transformed after our resurrection, so also the new heavens and new earth will be the same heavens and earth, but transformed, that is, restored to their original sanctified form before the fall. Our bodies and the universe will both be too glorious to be imagined with our current human brains.

Creation has not been redeemed yet. As of now only our souls have been redeemed (Romans 8:23), through baptism. After our baptism, when we (Christians) live in total obedience to God we contribute to the sanctification of the world and the glorification of God (Matthew 5:16). That is why Jesus gave us the sacraments so that our souls can survive spiritually in this fallen world (1 John 5:18) while we transform the world through our obedience to God, because without Jesus (the sacrament) we are nothing (John 15:5).

Revelation 21:3-4
*‚ÄúBehold, God‚Äôs dwelling is with the human race. He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will always be with them as their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there shall be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away.‚Äù*

‚ÄúGod‚Äôs dwelling‚Äù means ‚ÄúTabernacle‚Äù (Leviticus 26:11; Ezekial 37:27; Exodus 29:45) the place where God dwelt with His people in the Old Covenant (Exodus 40:34).
This ancient promise given by God through the prophets, is fulfilled through the Church (Jeremiah 24:7; 31:33; 32:38; Ezekial 11:20; 14:11; 37:23 & 27; Zechariah 8:8; Isaiah 25:8; 35:10).

In the New Covenant, God dwells with us (Emmanuel) in the ‚ÄúTabernacle‚Äù in Church, and within us, as God-man, when we receive the Body of Christ / Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace. But God‚Äôs ancient promise will be effective only if we continue leading holy lives.

The old creation could not give the people peace and happiness on earth and eternal life because the Old Covenant was not renewable and, due to the original sin, the power of evil was greater than good.

In the new creation, however, we have received a New Covenant which is renewable through the Sacraments of Reconciliation (Confession) (John 20:21-23) and the Eucharist (Communion), and through our Baptism we have received the peace of Christ, therefore we can now have eternal life. But the baptized ones can be happy only if they detach themselves from this world and rejoice in their sufferings.
In God‚Äôs Church, the ‚Äúold order‚Äù of death has passed away.

Revelation 21:5
*The one who sat on the throne said, ‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new.‚Äù*

This is not a future event. This is a present event. God will not make new things but He will make the existing things new by reviving the dead creation when we are baptized (2 Corinthians 5:17).

After going through the waters of the Red Sea, although the people of the old Covenant roamed in the wilderness, they actually belonged to a physical homeland (Israel) which they had not seen.

Similarly, after we are baptized, we, the people of the new Covenant, live physically in this world (the wilderness) but we do not belong to this world. We belong to our homeland (Heaven) which we have not yet seen. It is our homeland because we are now children of our Father in Heaven by virtue of our baptism.

Creation awaits restoration through the baptism of all humanity (Romans 8:19-23) and the reception of the Sacraments. Therefore, by leading holy lives we must be an example for the unbelievers so that they too may believe and come into God's kingdom (Matthew 5:16).

Revelation 21:6
*It is accomplished.*
God‚Äôs reign on earth, as God-man, already began when Jesus offered Himself on the Cross to complete the liturgical procedure of the Passover of the new Covenant (John 19:30).

*To the thirsty I will give a gift from the spring of life-giving water.*
The water of baptism will be given to those who desire or thirst for it.

Revelation 21:7
*The victor will inherit these gifts, and I shall be his God, and he will be my son.*
The victor is the Christian who overcomes the forces of evil, holds fast to the faith and does God‚Äôs Will even in the face of persecution, trials and tribulations. The victorious Christian enjoys divine affiliation by adoption, the promise made to the Churches (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; & 3:5, 12, 21; Galatians 4:4‚Äì7; Rom 8:14‚Äì17).

Revelation 21:10
*He took me in spirit to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven from God.*

John was now in Heaven in spirit, therefore he was shown the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the Kingdom of God in Heaven. The new earthly Jerusalem is a replica of the heavenly Jerusalem in spirit, because when we take part in the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), after we are purified through the Penitential Rite (Revelation 2 & 3) our spirits join the angels and saints in Heaven in their ongoing liturgy to worship God (Revelation 4:2) while our bodies are still on earth. Consequently, the words of the Lord‚Äôs prayer *"may Thy kingdom come, Lord, and may Thy Will be done on earth, as it is in Heaven"* are nowhere more profoundly fulfilled than during the celebration of the (the Mass), because, during this celebration, Heaven and earth are united in the most perfect way.

Revelation 21:12
*The Holy City had a massive, high wall, with twelve gates.*
A city with high walls and gates resembles a sheepfold and is a metaphor for the Church.
The heavenly Jerusalem has high spiritual walls to keep Satan out of its boundaries.
Similarly, like the sheepfold, the high spiritual walls of the Church on earth protect the Christians from predators/Satan. The high spiritual walls in a Church become stronger with the holiness of God's people. Like the sheep in a sheepfold, we are safe only as long as we are spiritually inside the Church, that is, if we lead holy lives. We can either be inside the Church or outside it. We cannot be lukewarm.
The good Shepherd (Jesus) will not allow any predator (Satan) to enter the sheepfold (Church) and snatch the sheep (holy souls) which belong to the Shepherd.

Revelation 21:22
*I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.*
In the new Jerusalem, the Temple/Church is where the Body of Christ (Eucharist) is because the Body of Christ is the Church/Temple (John 2:21).
In partaking of the Eucharistic meal, people became what they receive ‚Äúthe Body of Christ‚Äù / the Church. Hence, the Church is the Eucharist.

Revelation 21:27
*Nothing unclean will enter it (the holy city Jerusalem), nor anyone who does abominable things or tells lies. Only those will enter whose names are written in the Lamb‚Äôs book of life.*

At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan. Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state. But when they chose to obey Satan and eat from the forbidden Tree, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).

Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:22), so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.

But the decree forbidding humanity to eat the fruit from the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:22) has been revoked by Christ, therefore, now the children of Adam & Eve, who are born again through Baptism, have been given the privilege of being in a state of grace through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (John 20:23) so that they can eat the fruit (the Body of Christ / Communion) from the Tree of Life (the Cross) and receive divine life so that Jesus can raise them up on the last day (John 6:54).

Jesus has thus brought us back to God's original plan by preparing us for Eternal Life in the new Passover (Liturgy of the Mass), so that we can enter the Kingdom of God in Heaven whenever we die, and live forever with Christ.

Revelation 22:1-2
*Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city.*
This is a Trinitarian image where the throne of God is the presence of God the Father, the throne of the Lamb is the presence of God the Son and the river of the water of life is the presence of the Holy Spirit. It is the same river of living water which Jesus promised us according to the Gospel (John 7:37-39).

*On either side of the river grew the Tree of Life.*
The tree of life had disappeared from salvation history after the fall of man (in the book of Genesis), but we now have access to it (in the book of Revelation) at the end of the Bible because we are now in the eighth and final stage of the journey of salvation.

Revelation 22:3
*The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.*
To know how to worship God in Heaven the way He wants us to, we must practice worshipping Him on earth, through a liturgy (the Mass), by following how the Apostles worshipped God.
In Heaven there is no training center. The Kingdom of God on earth (the Church) is the training center. We must therefore attend Mass every Sunday and remain in a state of grace at all times.

Hebrews 11:1
Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will surely happen. It gives us assurance about things we cannot see.

Faith helps us to trust in God's power and providence and to believe that nothing can harm us without God's permission. Faith enables us to see the invisible realities that surpass the visible ones and to look forward to the eternal rewards which outweigh the temporal sufferings.

Hope is the confident desire of obtaining a future good that is difficult to attain. It is therefore a desire which implies seeking and pursuing some future good that is not yet possessed but wanted. This future good draws out a person's volition. Hope is confident that what is desired will certainly be attained. Hope recognizes that the object wanted is not easily obtained and therefore requires effort to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way.

We enter the Church with faith in the resurrection of Jesus and we remain in the Church with faith in the sacraments. The risen Christ was seen by hundreds of people but the living body of Jesus in the sacraments has not been seen by any human till today. It is total faith that God will keep His promise and grant us eternal life if we obey His commandments and receive the relevant sacraments regularly.

Hebrews 11:32-40
Through all their afflictions the people experienced one thing in common and that was the presence of God, His comfort and His strength.

Hebrews 12:1-2
*Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us and persevere in running the race that lies before us while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfecter of faith.*
The ‚Äúcloud of witnesses‚Äù are the saints referred to in Hebrews 11. Christian life is to be inspired not only by the Old Testament saints but above all by Jesus. As the architect of Christian faith, Jesus had himself to endure the Cross before receiving the glory of His triumph (Hebrews 12:2). Reflection on His sufferings should give His followers courage to continue the struggle, if necessary, even to the shedding of blood (Hebrews 12:3‚Äì4).

Hebrews 12:5-6
*You have also forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons: ‚ÄúMy son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord or lose heart when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines; he scourges every son he acknowledges.‚Äù*
After baptism we still incur a debt for post baptismal sins.
As an act of charity we can apply our sufferings as penance for the sins of others to reduce or remove any impediments to their holiness but our charity, however, does not contribute to the growth of holiness of others.

Hebrews 12:14
*Pursue peace with everyone, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.*
We become holy by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist, regularly. We maintain our holiness by reading the Scriptures and obeying the teachings of Christ.

We cannot enter Heaven unless we are as holy as Jesus in His humanity, but we cannot reach the same level of holiness as Jesus due to the weakness of our souls.
However, if we have made sincere efforts to live in obedience to God, led a humble life, died in friendship with Christ (with sanctifying grace), then we will have to remain in Purgatory for a while for our final purification (1 Corinthians 3:11-15).

Hebrews 12:16 (also Genesis 25:29)
*See to it that no one becomes like Esau, an immoral and godless person, who sold his birthright for a single meal.*
Birthright was a symbol of salvation which was to be handed down to the son.
Let us make sure that we don't sell our birthright (salvation) for a bowl of comfort or a few coins that cannot give us eternal life.
If we die rejecting God, we will lose our inheritance in heaven forever.

Hebrews 12:18-19
*You have not come to something that can be touched, a blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.*
This was the scenario at Mount Sinai, in the old Covenant, when God appeared to Moses and spoke to him, and the people could not bear the presence of God (Exodus 20:18-19). But that was due to the absence of sanctifying graces within their souls.
It is the same reason why no human on earth can see the face of God and live. It is the same reason why those in Hell will burn forever because God‚Äôs glory extends even upto Hell. It is like standing in front of the sun, even if we were ten kilometers away from the sun. Due to Adam & Eve‚Äôs sin we, on earth, do not have the power to withstand that heat.

The author was consoling the people that they were now in a much higher position than the people of the old Covenant.
In the new Covenant, when we are baptized, we receive sanctifying graces which perfect our souls. But the graces remain within our souls only until we break the Covenant by committing a mortal sin. Due to the weakness of our souls, the Covenant must therefore be renewed regularly by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist so that we remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times and continue receiving sanctifying graces.

Hebrews 12:22-24
*But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.*
The "assembly of the firstborn" is the Church on earth (the congregations who gather together to celebrate the Passover feast / the Mass) and the "spirits of the righteous made perfect" are the saints in Heaven, both together making up the entire Body of Christ, the Church, with an emphasis on the heavenly component, which is the source of our power.
While on earth we have bodies with spirits/souls, without which the body would decay. Saints in heaven are only spirits. God has perfected them because they were righteous when they left the earth.

When we (the assembly of the firstborn) gather together in Church (Mount Zion) to celebrate the new Passover / Mass, we join the angels and saints (spirits of the righteous made perfect) in worshipping God by singing their perpetual hymn (holy, holy, holy, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..) (Revelation 4:8) while Jesus (the mediator) intercedes for us to make atonement for our sins with His precious Blood (through Him, with Him, in Him‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..) (Hebrews 7:25).

Thereafter we celebrate the feast with a sacrificial meal (Communion) along with the angels and saints (festal gathering). If we have this meal with mortal sins on our soul then we will have to face the judgement of God (the judge of all) (1 Corinthians 11:27). During worship the priest eventually leads us to the Altar (the heavenly Jerusalem) where Jesus, the High Priest & King waits for us (Revelation 14:1).

Mount Zion is the hill in Jerusalem on which Jesus instituted the Eucharist / Last Supper) (on Maundy Thursday), the same place where the Church was born when the Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles, on the mother of Jesus and on the first congregation, on Pentecost Sunday.

The Last Supper and Pentecost Sunday were the two events which sealed the new Covenant. God blessed Zion abundantly in the old Covenant (Psalm 2:6; 132:13-14)
The Letter to the Hebrews was written in the first century AD when devotion to the angels was still very common.

David took the stronghold of Zion, which is now the city of David (2 Samuel 5:7).
Every time we gather around the Table of the Lord (the Altar) to worship God our spirits are actually in Heaven with the angels and saints celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus in the new Passover.

Hebrews 12:24
*The spirits of just men made perfect.*
The saints in heaven right now are incomplete because they do not have their bodies. This is why Scripture refers to the blessed in heaven as ‚Äúthe spirits/souls of the martyrs‚Äù (Rev. 6:9).

Hebrews 13:11-12
*For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin, are burned outside the camp.*
*Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.*
The animals which were burned outside the camp were a shadow of Jesus who was an image of the first Adam on the Cross. But the blood of Jesus is holy, so after the first Adam was destroyed outside the city gates, the blood of Jesus is offered during every Mass to sanctify us by making atonement for our sins (1 Corinthians 11:23-26).
