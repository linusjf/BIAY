### Bible In A Year

#### Intro

A daily youtube video will be sent out.
We start on Jan 1 and will complete reading the Bible on Dec 31.

1. After listening to the days video, if you feel inspired write down a few points and share it with the group. It could be single word or a whole paragraph.
2. Send your reflections to the group admins, the group admins will select a few reflections everyday.

The format for sharing is as below.

Sharing Content

The sharing content can‚Äôt be a single word or as long as you wish.
It‚Äôs really important to share as it motivates the whole group.
