### Day 138 Hurt for no fault of their own

We read that David has been re-instated as King and he is just settling back in. When he fleed he left 10 concubines behind to be in the house, remember Absalom wanted to show dominance over his father David and raped them in public. Now that David is back he takes them and puts them in a secure house but does not want to have anything to do with them, they live as desolate women. They have been hurt many times in their lives for no fault of their own, first off David makes them concubines ‚Äì which is itself one step lower than wives. David then leaves them when he was fleeing, Absalom then rapes them in public, and now David is just leaving them to die so to speak with not even the poor status of being a concubine. They have done nothing wrong till now, but have suffered due to others' sins.
We can relate to these poor women, there are many in this world who suffer due to other people‚Äôs sins. For Ex: The children of parents who are addicted to drugs, the young girls who are sold in the flesh trade at a tender age, and The spouse who is dealing with their partner's shortcomings and addictions. The list can go on, but what can we do, we need to help them and pray for them. Jesus‚Äô heart is moved with compassion for such people, that is why he always uplifted the widow and the orphan ‚Äì they could not fend for themselves back in the day.
However, if we face a situation that would possibly bring misery on us(for none of our wrongs) we should do our best to avoid getting into such situations. Do whatever it takes to be free and avoid such loopholes. We are children of God and should not be afraid to fight for our freedom.
For some inspiration let us look at the wise woman in the reading today who saved the whole city. The backstory is that Sheba had proclaimed himself king and was being perused by King David‚Äôs army and he took refuge in a city. Joab surrounded the city and was about to destroy the whole city. A wise woman steps in and pleaded that the city be spared and that she would take care of killing Sheba. She did and saved herself and the whole city's misery. Let us be inspired and try to wiggle our way out of trouble. Let us not be quiet and bear the consequences of others' sins.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
