### Day #145 Doing things with great precision

Just love the way King Solomon executes the blueprint that was handed down to him for the building of the temple. He is doing everything with great precision just as the Lord had instructed, silver where silver was needed, gold where old was needed, all the furniture fittings, the lampstands, the list goes on. Followed the prescribed way of transporting the ark of the covenant, the Levities/priests carried it.
When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. 2 Ch 5: 4,5
The Lord was very pleased with the dedication Solomon showed towards the building of the temple. The Lord was very pleased with the Israelites, for they had earlier opened their hearts to give towards the temple. We know the Lord was very pleased because of the cloud of smoke that filled the temple, which is an indication of the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord was so strong in the temple that because of the smoke the priest could not perform their duties.
Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud, and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God. 2 Ch 5: 14
King Solomon did that one great thing that the Lord was calling him to do. Did it with great dedication and precision.
What is the Lord calling me to do today? What is that one thing that the Lord is calling you to do? Maybe more than one great thing or one small thing or a bunch of little things that the Lord is calling you to do.
Maybe you are called to share God‚Äôs word, be a musician or singer for the Lord, be a Eucharistic Minister or Usher, Maybe God wants you to be a priest or religious, maybe you are called to do charity or be part of service ministry by feeding the poor, maybe you're called to be a good listener, a good husband or wife, a good parent, maybe your called to be a good example at your workplace.
It's up to us to identify our calling, we should listen carefully and seek God‚Äôs plan. Once we know our calling, we should do it with great dedication and precision. We should never lose sight of our goal, keep moving on, and with God‚Äôs help achieve it.
‚ÄúGod does not call us to be successful, He calls us to be faithful. Faithfulness and dedication are success even if we do not achieve what we want‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
