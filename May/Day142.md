### Day 142 Giving Freely and whole heartily

David has the greatest relief at the end of his life, he was the King of Israel, the shepherd that led the people. He struggled with sin and committed some big ones, however, he repented and was forgiven. His greatest desire was for the House of the Lord and the presence of the Lord. Because of His multiples sins and because he was a man with bloodshed on his hands, the Lord did not permit him to build something that is holy, the temple. However, God chose one of his sons, Solomon, to do this. Solomon was young and inexperienced, so David was concerned as a father. He now opens his heart and his treasure ‚Äì he keeps on giving ‚Äì if we try to add up what he offered to the Lord, it would be Thousands of Billions of $$$ in our current currency.
He knew for a fact that everything that he has was from the Lord, he was a young shepherd boy with nothing when the Lord called him to be King. David would have felt such joy when he pledges a lot of his riches to the building of the temple. But the real joy would have come from seeing everyone else open up their heart to giving towards the temple. David led by example and everyone followed.
In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‚ÄòIt is more blessed to give than to receive.‚Äô‚ÄùActs 20:35
It must have been such a good feeling for all of them. For it's more blessed to give than to receive. The realization that they had about all their wealth was actually what the Lord gave them, their ancestors were first slaves and then desert wanderers, the Lord brought them into the promised land, flowing with Milk and Honey.
When David asked the reason they replied as below:
‚ÄúBut who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 1 Cr 29:14-16
Let us also learn from them and realize that nothing that we have is our own, we have received it from the hands of the Lord. Let us be cheerful givers who give wholeheartedly of our time, talent, and treasure.
6 The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:6-7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 142 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 24:18 & 25
*On the same day Gad went to David and said to him, ‚ÄúGo and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.*
*Then David built an altar to the LORD there, and sacrificed burnt offerings and communion offerings. The LORD granted relief to the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.*

Satan put a thought in David‚Äôs mind to take a census of Israel to locate able bodied men capable of using the sword so that he could increase the strength of his physical army (1 Chronicles 21:1-5).   Therefore without consulting the Lord, David took a census of his people.  This made the Lord very angry so He sent a plague among David‚Äôs people.  Thereafter David was asked to sacrifice burnt offerings and communion offerings in atonement for his sin and the plague was withdrawn.

Very often Satan instigates us too to make choices to satisfy our will which would be against God‚Äôs Will.  Satan‚Äôs offers are always very juicy and we therefore choose to ignore God‚Äôs Will and go ahead according to our will, thus bringing suffering upon ourselves and our families.  When we realize our errors we must repent and confess our sins without delay and ensure to avoid making such choices.

*Why was Saul's sacrifice rejected by God (1 Samuel 13:13) but David‚Äôs sacrifice accepted?*

Both Saul and David offered sacrifices which only the Levitical priests had authority to do, but David (a non-Levite) also exercised a priesthood, and his priesthood was passed on to his sons (2 Samuel 8:18).  David was known to have done other priestly acts during his lifetime which only the Levitical priests had authority to do  (example :  wearing the priestly Ephod, taking care of the Ark, offering sacrifices, blessing the people in the name of the Lord) (2 Samuel 6:14-15 & 17-18) because God permitted it through the Prophet Gad (2 Samuel 24:18).

Saul, however, was not permitted to perform any priestly duties.

*But why did God permit David to perform priestly duties?*

When David conquered Jerusalem and sat on the throne (2 Samuel 5:5), he actually succeeded the previous king of Salem (Melchizedek) who was also a priest (Genesis 14:18).  Thus David opened the door and paved the way for the priesthood of the Judah tribe, to the order of Melchizedek, which later, Jesus, son of David, would hand over to His apostles to make it universal as God had originally desired (Exodus 19:6).

Like David, Jesus was also 30 years old when he became king and priest (2 Samuel 5:4).
At Jerusalem, David reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years (2 Samuel 5:5), which was the full span of the life of Jesus, son of David, and King of the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 24:24
*‚ÄúI will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.‚Äù*

David wanted to buy that place to offer his sacrifice. Araunah was not going to charge David anything, but David insisted on paying for it.  He did not want to offer God anything that cost him nothing.

It is easy to serve God when we give our excess.
Sacrificing to God means that it must cost us something.
We can sacrifice our hearts and time to do God‚Äôs work.  He wants people to give themselves to Him, willingly and completely.  He wants their time and their abilities to do His work.
To sacrifice something means to give up something we love the most or something that we are attached to.  It must cost us something, otherwise it is not really a sacrifice.
We can sacrifice our entertainment time to serve God or we can give up our children to the service of God (religious).  We can share what we have with the less fortunate ones even if we have to do with less.

We have to decide on what and how much we are willing to give God.
