### Day 142 Giving Freely and whole heartily

David has the greatest relief at the end of his life, he was the King of Israel, the shepherd that led the people. He struggled with sin and committed some big ones, however, he repented and was forgiven. His greatest desire was for the House of the Lord and the presence of the Lord. Because of His multiples sins and because he was a man with bloodshed on his hands, the Lord did not permit him to build something that is holy, the temple. However, God chose one of his sons, Solomon, to do this. Solomon was young and inexperienced, so David was concerned as a father. He now opens his heart and his treasure ‚Äì he keeps on giving ‚Äì if we try to add up what he offered to the Lord, it would be Thousands of Billions of $$$ in our current currency.
He knew for a fact that everything that he has was from the Lord, he was a young shepherd boy with nothing when the Lord called him to be King. David would have felt such joy when he pledges a lot of his riches to the building of the temple. But the real joy would have come from seeing everyone else open up their heart to giving towards the temple. David led by example and everyone followed.
In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‚ÄòIt is more blessed to give than to receive.‚Äô‚ÄùActs 20:35
It must have been such a good feeling for all of them. For it's more blessed to give than to receive. The realization that they had about all their wealth was actually what the Lord gave them, their ancestors were first slaves and then desert wanderers, the Lord brought them into the promised land, flowing with Milk and Honey.
When David asked the reason they replied as below:
‚ÄúBut who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 1 Cr 29:14-16
Let us also learn from them and realize that nothing that we have is our own, we have received it from the hands of the Lord. Let us be cheerful givers who give wholeheartedly of our time, talent, and treasure.
6 The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:6-7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
