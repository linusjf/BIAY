### Day #135 ‚ÄúBad counsel can lead to destruction‚Äù

Absalom is now looking for counsel to become King of Israel. Ahithophel suggests that he will choose 12K men to pursue King David and strike him down. Once the King is dead everyone will naturally follow Absalom, now everyone likes this suggestion.
Absalom wants a second opinion and asks Hushai. Hushai is loyal to David and is just pretending to be on Absalom‚Äôs side. Hushai is very crafty with his words and makes a suggestion, one that will favor King David. Before he suggests he rejects Ahithophel‚Äôs suggestion and says that 12K men will not be enough to kill King David as he is a warrior King and has Valant men who will defeat the 12K men.
Hushai suggests that Absalom take the whole of Israel and pursue David, just to ensure he does not get away. He also suggests that Absalom should personally go to battle, which appealed to him so he could get the credit for killing David. Everyone liked this suggestion better and they wanted to implement it. Hushai sends messengers ahead to David so that David can escape and be prepared to take out Absalom instead.
As we will see in future episodes Hushai‚Äôs counsel was what brought the downfall of Absalom.
We need to learn from this to be very careful about the advice we get from people. This world is filled with shrewd and cunning people who don‚Äôt really care about us. They just want their own motives met when they suggest something to us.
See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Mat 10:16
Jesus knows that this world is full of cunning people and that‚Äôs why he tells us to be wise as serpents. We cannot trust the advice of anyone, we need to test everyone to see if they come from the Lord or from the world.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1
May we find friends of good counsel and spiritual directors who can guide us on the right path.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
