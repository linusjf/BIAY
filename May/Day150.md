### Day #150 A time for everything

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:
a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
Just reading this scripture brings so much peace. In our earthly lives, we will face different situations, phases, seasons, and experiences. One does not have to be smiling all the time, there are times when we will mourn when we will be silent, we are called to have joy ‚Äì joy is that inner peace that will not leave us even if we are going through a storm. The inner peace that knows that God is in control.
Everything will eventually pass away, if everything is going right in your life now, it will go away and you will have problems and worries. If you‚Äôre having problems and worries that will also pass and you will have peace. Our life is a rollercoaster ride, we will go through difficulties and happiness, peace and war, time to move, and time to stay. But the one thing that will never change is God. God is the same forever, He will never change.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.Heb 13:8
The best way to ride the waves of life is to stay close to Jesus. Jesus never changes He is always the same and is always next to us. It is important to mourn when we lose a loved one. It is important to move on sometimes in our life. It is important to take on new opportunities and do new things. It is also important to hold onto things that are good. It is important to hold onto good relationships and to discard those that are not beneficial for you. (the goal is that we all grow closer to God as we learn to love each other)
Keep moving forwards knowing that Jesus is the same and He is with you. Right now it's time to rejoice because you completed reading 150 days of the Bible. Hurray!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
