### Day #128 How to handle "humiliation"

We read that King David wanted to be kind and loyal to the Ammonites because Nahash the ammonite king(dead now) was good to him.
David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.2 Sam 10:2
However, Nahash’s son Hanun was influenced by his commanders and humiliates David’s men.
So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away. 2 Sam 10: 4
Now David’s men were greatly humiliated, but David handled the situation very well he went out to meet the men and asked them to stay at Jericho until their bead grew back.
David then send his Valant men who defeated the Ammoniates.
Now how do we handle humiliations? Let’s think of the last time we felt humiliated. We will mostly resort to one of two responses – fight or flight. If we chose to fight - we will try to humiliate the other person even worse or get angry and curse them. If we resort to flight - we will try to pass it off as though nothing happened or leave the place.
The best way to handle humiliation is to pray first, and try not to get humiliated because that is what they want.
Then warn the person sternly that their word or action is not acceptable, most people would back off at this point.
If they still persist then action is needed, everyone is under some authority. And the Lord is watching over you, He will fight for you, fight for the people who do the right thing.
A true event in St Mother Theresa’s life
One day Mother Teresa went to a local bakery to ask for bread for the starving children in the orphanage. The baker, outraged at people begging for bread from him, spat in her face and refused. Mother Teresa calmly took out her handkerchief, wiped the spit from her face and said to the baker, “Okay, that was for me. Now what about the bread for the orphans?” The baker, shamed by her response, gave her the bread she wanted.
Like St Mother Theresa let us turn to Jesus who was humiliated, spat upon, mocked and insulted, beaten and stripped naked. He was able to pray
“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
It is not easy to stay calm and respond in a proper way, we are not Jesus or Mother Theresa. But we can be and God will help us in our weakness, that someday we will be able to respond in love. When people hurt us, or insult us those are all actual prayer requests, they are indirectly asking us “Can you pray for me?”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
