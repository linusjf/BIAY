### Day #140 “Your help made me great”

David has been through a lot in his life, his life has been a roller-coaster ride, sometimes he is up and sometimes down. He was a courageous young man - one after God’s own heart, who defended his sheep from the wild animals, the brave boy who slain the giant, the harp player that dove out evil spirits, the brave soldier who slay ten thousands, he was the great king of Israel that won many battles and a prefiguration of Jesus the King of Kings. He also has his moments of weakness where he multiplied wives and concubines, gave into sloth, lusted, and committed murder, the most important thing is that he knew how to repent from his heart. Every time he went down, he prayed and repented and came right back up. He was perused many times to be killed by King Saul and even his own son Absalom. He is now too weak to go to battle escaped death by a whisker. What made King David great was not his victories or his failures but his unfailing trust in the help that came from the Lord. Another translation of the Greek word is “Gentleness”  - we are need God’s compassion and mercy – if God is not gentle and quick to judge us, we will not stand a chance. If our sins were numbered we will be long gone.

Let us also hold on to the Lord and seek his help and gentleness. We should be able to proclaim like David, that
“The lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God my rock in whom I take refuge” 2 Sam 22:2-3

We should remember that the battle belongs to the Lord, just how young boy David went up to fight the Philistine with pebbles. We should go up to fight our battles with the pebbles of the rosary, which are the mysteries of Jesus’ life. As we pray on our beeds, we can slain the giants in our lives.

Because our God is not distant or passive, but He is active always ready to come to our aid.

“He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet. He rode on a cherub and flew he was seen upon the winds of the wind.” 2Sam 22: 11-12

Let us like David at the end of our lives be in a place where we can proclaim that the Lord is faithful and our entire life is dependent on Him. He was the one who helped us and moved us through every difficulty and sin. God is our ever present help in trouble, and that we will be rewarded with Heaven. I hope and pray at the end of our lives which have been like a roller-coaster ride, we will be able to say “Your help/gentleness made me great”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
