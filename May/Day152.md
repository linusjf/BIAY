### Day #152 The living know they will die, and the dead know nothing

‚ÄúThe living know they will die, and the dead know nothing.‚Äù Ecc 9:5
One of the best revelations that one can receive is the fact that we are just sojourners on earth.
This is not our destination; this is the road that we are to travel. Our citizenship is in heaven or hell, our goal in the earthly life is to get to heaven and take as many as we can.
For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven. Ph 3:18
Both Ecclesiastics and St Paul are sorting people into two categories. Those who are only concerned about the earthly life and those who are focused on the next life. We can see those who live for their bellies and the vain glory. Those who are laser-focused on this earthly life and everything that it has to offer. Their destiny is destruction ‚Äì they will never find satisfaction on earth no matter how much of earthly things they receive. They live life as though there is no tomorrow, like they will never die. Just living in the moment and chasing after everything that glitters.
On the other hand, those who know they will die. Those are the ones who say this world and all its things are passing away. We will die and will be forgotten. All their actions and thoughts are in preparation for the next world. With the focus on the next world, we will experience heaven on earth. For we stop focusing on the earthly stuff we have, the stuff we need, our temporary earthly suffering rather learn life lessons from them.
One self-test that we can do is to list all our prayers and sort into two categories, prayers for this world vs prayers for next world.
For Ex: Prayer for this world - physical healing, finances {Note: these are genuine prayers and should be prayed}
Prayers for the next world ‚Äì prayers for breakthrough from sin, prayers for the fruits of the Spirit, for wisdom.
As we list out the prayers we may be able to see if we are focused on this world or the next.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
