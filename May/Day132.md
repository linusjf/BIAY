### Day \#132 Holding a grudge - Michael Eltham ###
We are still getting over the misery that Tamar went through, her stepbrother Amnon raped her and threw her away. Her whole life was ruined she could not get married after that as in the Jewish custom then, only virgins get married. Her brother Absalom takes her into his house and she lives her life as a desolate woman. What a tragedy, a life wasted due to Amnon‚Äôs lust. If it wasn't for Amnon, Tamar would have gotten married and had children and raised them, she is deprived of the family life. This caused a lot of hate in Absalom‚Äôs heart, and he worked up a plan to avenge His sister‚Äôs rape. He invites the sons of David for an event at his house and had Amnon killed.
Absalom flees and is in hiding. Now Joab tries to patch things up by tricking David to listen to a wise woman‚Äôs fake story(Joab tried to use the format Nathan used to convict David of his sin ‚Äì by telling a similar story) we can read the story, and eventually, David asks Absalom to come back to the city. However, David does not let him come into his presence for two full years. Absalom is getting frustrated as the king asked him to come back but does not let him come into his presence. The Kind does not talk to Absalom directly, he is letting him stay in the city but does not accept him back as a son. David and Absalom are just tolerating each other here, there is no repentance or forgiveness, and the love is not restored.
This is the state of many families today, there is a lot of hate, misunderstanding, and grudges between family members ‚Äì between parents and children, between siblings, between cousins, between in-laws. Most people are taking the positions that David and Absalom took ‚Äì no repentance or forgiveness ‚Äì we are just tolerating each other without actually sorting out the problem, without genuine repentance or forgiveness. There is bitterness in the air, one person not talking to the other, not seeing eye to eye, hurtful words and gestures.
The model we have in David and Absalom is not the one we should be following. We should follow the model of the prodigal son and the Father. The Father in the parable was looking out for his son every day, waiting for him to come back, David was just grieving his other son's death and not even concerned about Absalom. Absalom was acting like the prodigal son, the prodigal son had an attitude of ‚ÄúAt least I will be a servant at my father's house‚Äù - Absalom was burning down fields in frustration.
Let us model our repentance and forgiveness on the parable of the prodigal son. Let us pray for our families and especially for the strained relationships. It is easier said than done, but let us not feel discouraged for ‚Äúwhen we are weak He is strong.‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
