### Day 143 Asking God for the right things

We read this very famous event where Solomon asks for wisdom. At night God appears to Solomon and said “Ask what I shall give thee.” Solomon’s answered
10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 2 Ch 1:10
God was so pleased with Solomon’s answer.
11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. 2Ch 1: 11-12
Solomon received wisdom but that did not automatically make him perfect, it just made him wise. Now wisdom can be used for good or bad, he uses it to do things that the Lord did not command. Like, amass horses and chariots and horses from Egpyt.
There are two lessons to learn here, Asking for the right things in prayer and being obedient to God’s commands, or else all our talents and efforts are in vain.
Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge from the Lord and everything else was added on like riches, wealth, and honor. In the same way, we need to seek first the Kingdom of God and everything else will be added on. When we pray we should ask for God’s presence, love, and mercy in our lives, every other thing will be added in.
Some people when they pray are only praying prayers of petition and request, some even are trying to make a deal with the Lord and say – “If you answer this prayer, I will do this good deed” we should not worry too much about earthly things -they will be added on when we ask for Jesus himself. If you have the King – the whole kingdom will be granted.

But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Mat 6:33
Let us ask God for wisdom and understanding, not just that but the grace to live a life according to his calling and his Word.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
