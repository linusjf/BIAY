### Day #151 Do not pay attention to every word people say

“Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you— for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.” Ecc 7:21-22
This is excellent advice to our very self-obsessed generation. Compared to the previous generations, we have become very self-conscious about what others think about us. We care too much about others' opinions, sometimes we can go to the extent of shaping our lives based on what people think.
We are worried that our neighbor's lawn is greener than ours, that our friends are making more money than us, that our siblings are more successful than us, and we are afraid to wear certain clothes as it makes us look thick(see I had to think before writing fat). We are so concerned that our phones are the latest model and that are cars are posh enough.
“What do people think of me?” has even entered the spiritual circles. We hear homilies that are sweet and politically correct.
We seldom hear homilies spoken with conviction that causes people to repent (Although there have been homilies that have cut to the heart and caused me to repent) We do not hear the call to repentance as we read it in the Gospel. Like Peter preached on Pentecost “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!” and we do not hear that response “What should we do to be saved”.
We all try to be so pious and good in front of others but are gossiping and slandering our very “so-called” spiritual friends behind their back. We need to break ourselves free from the shackles that cause us to portray a perfect picture of ourselves. We need to realize that we are all broken, all are fallen and in need of a savior. Let us not be overly concerned about what others think of us, God looks into our hearts and knows us through and through.
Let us shout it out from the rooftops, and tell everyone not to be concerned about what others think.
“Save yourselves from this crooked generation!” Acts 2:40
Just live the best life you can. What others think about us is their problem.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. ✌️

### BIAY Day 151 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 9:10-13
The Solomonic Temple was designed by God, revealed to David (in a dream) who handed it over to Solomon to construct it. However, the actual construction of the Temple was carried out by the laborers of Hiram, the prince of Tyre, who was not only a gentile but a descendant of the Canaanites.

At Sinai, God's people were commanded to avoid the gentile Canaanites.

At Zion, God's people hired the gentile Canaanites to help them in building God's Temple and Solomon later gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

Thus, by uniting the Jews and the gentiles politically and geographically, Solomon was gradually moving towards the reversal of Babel which would finally be fulfilled on Pentecost Sunday.
