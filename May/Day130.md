### Day 130 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 12:1-15
David committed a sin by killing an innocent man (Uriah) to cover up his first sin of adultery (2 Samuel 11:1-25).

When prophet Nathan asked David to judge a case of a poor man being robbed by a rich man, David was quick to condemn the rich man for the injustice, while he kept his own sin covered.

We all commit sins due to the weakness of our damaged souls. Some of us are aware of our own weaknesses and we try to correct and improve ourselves, which is good. But some of us are blind to our own weaknesses while the weaknesses in others are so obvious to us that we condemn them.

Jesus said, “Let the one among you who is without sin, be the first one to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7).

God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17).

I came not to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12:47).

When Jesus does not condemn us, then who are we to condemn others?
When we see weaknesses or sins in others, let us be slow to condemn them.  Let it be an occasion for us to do a soul-searching, make a list of our own weaknesses and ask the Lord for pardon.

### Day #130 “3 C’s to Repentance – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart”

As we study Bible Characters we should always place ourselves in their shoes or identify with them, as we are all weak human beings. Apart from reading about their horrendous sins, we should also learn how they dealt with them. King David can teach us a great lesson on repentance, in fact, his Psalm, Psalm 51 has been the one most people use when they have committed a sin and are repenting. There is a big misconception about Christian repentance, because of the word used. The word repentance is defined as - sincere regret or remorse. However, repentance is not merely feeling sorry about what you did, it is being contrite and deciding to change your ways. The Greek word used in the gospels is
Metanoia– which means “a transformative change of heart”.
There are three steps to repentance.
CONVICTION
We see that King David commits major sins of Sloth, Adultery, and Murder and now breaks another one of the 10 commandments by bringing Bathsheba into his home, thinking that all is well. But the Lord was not happy about His servant David. He sends the prophet Nathan to tell David the story about the unjust owner of many sheep. David is cut to his heart, and he is convicted of his sin.
We need people in our lives to tell us when we are going off track, our spouse, parents, children, friends, society, priest, confessors, spiritual directors, events, retreats, sermons, word of God, talks, BIAY whatever it takes to convict us. We need the Holy Spirit who will lead us to all truth about ourselves, the Holy Spirit will convict us of our mistakes.
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Ps 51:3
CONTRITION
a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. Ps 51:17
This is the golden verse for repentance, when we are convicted of sin we should be cut to the heart. Feeling sorry for having offended our ever-loving God. We should not just focus on the wrong thing we did, but on the relationship that is broken due to sin. We are hurting our God and our neighbor when we sin, we are actually hurting the church as we are the body of the church. We cannot come to the Lord with pride or excuses for committing sin. just with a contrite and broken heart
Change of Heart
It just does not stop at sorrow for sin, it starts with a Change of heart. We have a God of second chances, He wants us to overcome sin and death. God will take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh; He will put a new and willing spirit in us. Change is the most important part of repentance. Whenever Jesus healed or forgave sin in His earthly ministry he always said – “Sin no more”
So what happens if we fall into sin again, don’t be discouraged just follow the process again CCC – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart. If you keep falling into sin, just keep getting up.
Saint Faustina reminds us to never give up.
I perform works of mercy in every soul. The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. My mercy is confirmed in every work of My hands. He who trusts in My mercy will not perish, for all his affairs are Mine, and his enemies will be shattered at the base of My footstool (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 723).
Just keep going to the font of mercy whenever you need to be washed of your sin. Eventually, the Lord will break you out of the sins you are unable to shake off. All the three C’s are present in the sacrament of confession, so frequent it as much as possible to rid yourself of sin.
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:15-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
