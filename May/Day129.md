### Day 129 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 11:1-27
During the spring of the year, when Kings fought at the battlefields, David sent his officers to fight the Ammonites. Against his call of duty, David chose to stay back and while away his time at the palace.  David committed one grave mistake.  He sent the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield. The Ark of the Covenant symbolized the presence of God.  David ended up committing adultery with Bathsheba because he then rested in the palace without the presence of God.

While idling away his time, David happened to see what he was not supposed to see. He could have looked the other way and moved on with his royal duties but he chose to continue looking.

If we happen to see something that we are not supposed to see, it is definitely not our mistake. However, if we decide to continue looking on with interest, and think with passion, we are surely putting ourselves on risky grounds.

David looked on and entered the dark and dubious world of sin. He entertained the evil spirit and allowed the spirit to control his mind.

When God is not with us it is very easy for the evil spirit to control our minds to do ungodly acts.

Later, to hide one sin David ended up committing another sin by killing Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba.

The closer we get to the object of our temptation, the more destructive it gets. We must flee from sin as from a snake.  Sin traps us into a vicious cycle.

When we allow ourselves to be influenced by one evil spirit, it will invite more evil spirits into our lives and thus we end up committing one sin after another to cover up the first sin if we don’t repent and try to get rid of the first one.

Failure of our spiritual lives begins with the absence of God in our lives and gradually affects our physical lives.

### Day #129 David’s Sloth leads to Adultery and Murder

We have been reading David’s life story, he was such a lovely person – a man after God’s heart, a just, kind, and wise King, he was a worshiper of God – a musician and one who loved the presence of the Lord. However, he has his weaknesses– we know that he was accumulating wives and concubines which the Lord forbid for the Kings of Israel.
In this sequence of events, the first sin David committed was the sin of sloth.
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Sam 11:1
The kings in those days would go out to fight battles, however, David did not go – he sent his commanders instead. David should have been out there fighting battles for the Lord, however, the scripture says that he was sleeping on the couch in the afternoon and walking on the roof instead.
Laziness is creeping into him, with comfort and luxury, his will and spirit are weakened. He looks at a woman bathing and should have just looked away.
From the sin of lust of the eyes, it went to lust of the thoughts. He is thinking of her and eventually makes inquiries about her. He comes to know that it’s Uriah’s wife one of his trusted men. He should have backed off at least now, but his lust overtook him. He mis-uses his power as King and gets what he wants. Bathsheba becomes pregnant and now David is desperate. He tries to fix it by bringing Uriah back to his house to sleep with his wife, just doesn’t work for Uriah was a just man.
Eventually, He plots the death of Uriah and commits murder. David was a person to consult the Lord for everything, here he is falling head over heels into different sins.
What can we learn from this? We can learn that we are all broken earthen vessels, no one is perfect not even the great people of the Bible. But God makes us all whole again.
The other thing that we can learn is that we should stop sin when it's small and easy to overcome. If David has to resist the sin of sloth, he would have gone to battle and won victories, he would have prevented the other grave sins.
We should also try to avoid the near occasion of sins, we all know our weaknesses – we should avoid falling into bigger traps. For example: If you struggle with the sin of alcoholism – avoid going to a bar or going out with friends who love to drink,
if you are addicted to shopping – do not carry your credit card – use cash when you go shopping,
if you are addicted to pornography – use your devices only in public places/family rooms.
It is easy to say no to sin at the beginning – once you cross the hedge – you cannot stop yourself.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
