### Day 129 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 11:1-27
During the spring of the year, when Kings fought at the battlefields, David sent his officers to fight the Ammonites. Against his call of duty, David chose to stay back and while away his time at the palace.  David committed one grave mistake.  He sent the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield. The Ark of the Covenant symbolized the presence of God.  David ended up committing adultery with Bathsheba because he then rested in the palace without the presence of God.

While idling away his time, David happened to see what he was not supposed to see. He could have looked the other way and moved on with his royal duties but he chose to continue looking.

If we happen to see something that we are not supposed to see, it is definitely not our mistake. However, if we decide to continue looking on with interest, and think with passion, we are surely putting ourselves on risky grounds.

David looked on and entered the dark and dubious world of sin. He entertained the evil spirit and allowed the spirit to control his mind.

When God is not with us it is very easy for the evil spirit to control our minds to do ungodly acts.

Later, to hide one sin David ended up committing another sin by killing Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba.

The closer we get to the object of our temptation, the more destructive it gets. We must flee from sin as from a snake.  Sin traps us into a vicious cycle.

When we allow ourselves to be influenced by one evil spirit, it will invite more evil spirits into our lives and thus we end up committing one sin after another to cover up the first sin if we donâ€™t repent and try to get rid of the first one.

Failure of our spiritual lives begins with the absence of God in our lives and gradually affects our physical lives.
