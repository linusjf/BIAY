### Day #126 The Lord gave David victory wherever he went

In the last chapter, we see King David was gifted a Palace by the neighboring King – who sent wood, carpenters, and workers to build a palace. Now David is concerned for the Lord and feels unworthy to live in the Palace while God rests in a tent. This seems like a very just and genuine concern for the Lord, so much so that Nathan the prophet says yes immediately. However, at night the Lord says no, but the Lord rewards David’s concern, the word of the Lord said
“I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth” 2 Sam 7:9
We see that David starts his wars against the neighboring kingdoms and places, the bible records the thousands of men who were conquered and those who were slain. King David’s army was winning every battle – because of the promise of the Lord to make his name great.
“The Lord gave victory to David wherever he went” 2 Sam 8:14
The promises of the Lord are true and genuine.
The promises of the Lord are sure, silver refined in a crucible, silver purified seven times. Ps 12:7
Let us remember that the word of the Lord will never return empty, it will always accomplish its purpose
so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Is 55:11
So my friends let us not be discouraged but trust in the promise of the Lord for His word will never return empty but will accomplish all that God has in store for us.
David’s kingdom will enhance even more than he can imagine through his children and eventually by God himself – in Jesus Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 126 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 10:13-14
*So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.*

King Saul lost the throne and his life because of the 4 sins which he had committed against the Lord:

1. For the massacre of priests in the city of Nob because they were protecting David;

A priest is God's anointed man who represents God on earth.  When we harm a priest, physically or verbally or in any other way, we offend God directly.

2. For sparing the Amalekite King Agag out of pity, instead of destroying him in obedience to God’s command (1 Samuel 15:17-21);

The Amalekite King Agag was a symbol of sin.  When we allow ourselves to live comfortably in sin, instead of destroying it completely, the sin will eventually be the cause of the destruction of our soul (Hell).

3. For not heeding Samuel’s request to wait for him for seven days to offer the sacrifice;

Offering to God the sacrifice prescribed by God, can be done only by God's anointed priests.  Anyone else trying to offer the prescribed sacrifice, even if they know the procedure, is trying to be like God without God, and that is an act of the devil.

4. For consulting a necromancer, instead of consulting the Lord.

According to the Mosaic Law, consulting people who were involved with occult practices, was forbidden (Deut. 18:10).
In the new Covenant, the Church still follows the same Law to this day.  Practicing divination, or using the services of people who are involved with occult practices, is a mortal sin.

In the old Covenant, Saul lost his physical life for committing these sins, but in the New Covenant, we will lose our spiritual/eternal life.
