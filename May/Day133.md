### Day #133 Falling to correct our kids can make them rebellious

As we try to wrap our heads around the mess in David‚Äôs family, Amnon rapes his stepsister Tamar and her brother Absalom avenging it by killing Amnon (his stepbrother). One can‚Äôt help but call out the lack of action on David‚Äôs part. David being their father should have stepped in and handled the situation better, he should have asked the Lord for direction on what needed to be done. David was great when it came to his ruling as King but he let his personal life slip, he failed to be a good father.
The first mistake he made was to have so many wives and children even though God forbid it for the Kings of Israel. The second mistake was his lack of prudent about sending Tamar to Amnon‚Äôs house. The third mistake was In-action toward Amnon‚Äôs sin ‚Äì he failed to protect his daughter and failed to take her in to his house after Amnon sent her off. Fourth he failed to make peace with Absalom and failed to give him back his position as son and did not assign him any duty in the kingdom.
This caused Absalom, who was very good-looking and smart, clever, and a man with an initiative to gain popularity. Eventually, due to King David‚Äôs inaction ‚Äì he now must flee from his own son Absalom. David has let down his people and let down the Lord in failing to be a good father.
Let us learn from this and be good parents to our children, parents who love, forgive, and discipline them when they go off track. If we fail to act, we are supporting their sin. They will grow in their sin and bad habits and eventually become a beast someday. They will be a force that neighed we or society cannot content with, we will have to flee as well.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
