### Day #146 Let your faith life exceed the Sunday obligation

We know that King Solomon built the temple with great precision, and it pleased the Lord. But the building is not everything, dedicating it and active sacrifice followed. The Temple was established as the central place to worship, everyone needed to go up there to worship. This caused a lot of activity and a lot of prayer and sacrifice, a lot of celebration, atonement for sins, and spending time in the presence of the Lord. King Solomon was instrumental in really getting the people together and united in prayer for the Lord. The amount of food that was offered and prepared there was enormous, showing a sign of how active the temple was.
The temple was full of life and abundance. Just like the temple described in Ezekiel where the river flowing from the temple brought life wherever it went.
Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there. It will become fresh; and everything will live where the river goes. Ez 47:9
We can compare two things to the temple of God

1. Our Parish

2. Our faith lives

Our Parish should be a place of refuge, a place for prayer and worship of God, and a place where the sacrifice of the Mass is offered. There is something about getting dressed and leaving our homes to go to a central place for worship, it puts our hearts in the right state to worship God ‚Äì opposed to saying I‚Äôm just going to stay in my PJs and pray in my room. The church is a place for community worship, a central place where we can join our brothers and sisters in Christ. It‚Äôs not about how good the building looks, a posh church in the developed world can seem dull as compared to a shack of a building in a third world country ‚Äì what matters are the people and their faith, not the building. I am so blessed to be part of a very active parish ‚Äì the building is beautiful and so is the faith community. My advice ‚Äì find one or make your parish into one.
Our faith lives should go beyond the Sunday obligation, the bare minimum. If you take lessons to learn an instrument once a week and do not practice all week, you will never progress you will be stuck in a rut. In the same way, we cannot just survive on the Sunday Obligation, just offering 1 hour a week to God will not get you anywhere.
We are the temple of God now in the New Testament, our hearts need to be active and vibrant ‚Äì constantly abiding in the presence of the Lord. By doing the BIAY we are already beyond that basic stage, dedicating 20-30 mins every day is truly something that you should be proud about. But it does not stop here, we should continue to practice the presence of the Lord in our lives, praising him always and praying unceasingly. The River of the Holy Spirit should flow from our hearts bringing life to everyone we encounter.
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 1 Cor 6:19
Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-18
Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them. John 7:38
Let us go beyond the Sunday obligation to the point where we are becoming the temple of God, constantly praying, rejoicing and the springs of living waters, the Holy Spirit will flow from our hearts.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
