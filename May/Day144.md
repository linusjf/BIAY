### Day #144 Queen Mother

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus’ dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1
May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are “I am a handmaid of the Lord”, “My soul magnifies the Lord”, and “Do as he says, listen to him”. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 144 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 2:13-22
In the earthly Davidic kingdom of the old Covenant, when Solomon, son of David, was crowned king, he had a throne kept at his right, for the queen, and the queen was his mother, not his wife.  Thereafter, in Judea, every king had a queen and, by default, the queen was always the king’s mother, not his wife.  Solomon’s mother held a regal office in the kingdom.  She was known as the “Gebirah” (the “Great Lady” or “Queen Mother”).

This was a fore shadow or prototype of the new Covenant kingdom.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom of the new Covenant, Jesus is the King. Therefore, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom, His mother becomes the Queen, by default and she would sit on a throne at the right hand of her son, Christ the King.

Most of the petitions from the people would come to King Solomon through his mother, who was the intercessor between the king and the people.  The petitions presented by the Queen Mother were given first preference by the royal son, but the decision always rested with the royal son.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the intercessor between God’s people and her royal Son.  Jesus will always give first preference to the petitions presented by His Queen Mother.

Bathsheba’s petition was, however, rejected by King Solomon because she took an ungodly petition to him.

Jesus will never reject His mother’s petitions.  He will always grant the petitions presented by His mother, having lived His earthly life with her for 33 years and knowing fully well that His mother would never ask Him to do something against God’s Will.  The same mother, who at a young age was ready to go through suffering, and sacrificed her only Son to save the world, in obedience to God’s Will; the same mother who taught Him to live His life according to God’s Will so that God was very pleased with Him.  We have an earthly example of this when Mary took the people’s petition to her Son during the wedding at Cana (John 2:3) but she insisted on the people obeying her Son (John 2:5).

Therefore, whether we ask Mary for spiritual gifts, or material gifts, or to help us through our sufferings, etc. she will take our petitions to her Son only if our request is in accordance with God’s Will.

Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all the rest will be given unto you (Matthew 6:33).
