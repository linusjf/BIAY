### Day #144 Queen Mother

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus‚Äô dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1
May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are ‚ÄúI am a handmaid of the Lord‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy soul magnifies the Lord‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDo as he says, listen to him‚Äù. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
