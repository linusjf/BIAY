### Day #125 Mary the New Ark of the covenant

In today’s reading, the most important thing to call out is this parallel between the OT ark of the covenant and Mary the new ark of the covenant. The easiest way to call out the similarities is through a table, please read the similarities in the table comparison. After reading the similarities if we still have a doubt that Mary is the new ark of the covenant, we can fast forward to Revelations Chapters 11:19 and 12:1. As a first-century Jew you have been waiting for the ark of the covenant to show up for almost 6 centuries, since the time of Jeremiah. So when John has the vision of the Revelations the big deal is that the ark that was missing is finally found in heaven.
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1
Let us honor our lady the new ark of the covenant that carries the fulfillment of all the old testament prefiguration - she carries Jesus. For non-Catholics, this reflection may be hard to read, would suggest just asking God for revelation with an open mind.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Old and New Covenants

### Day 125 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 6:6-7
Uzzah died because the Ark of the Covenant was not given its due respect.
According to the Law, the Ark of the Covenant was to be touched and carried only by the ordained Levites, and Uzzah was not a Levite.  Also, David was transporting the Ark in a cart.
God may have given the Law to Moses centuries ago, but the Law was still the same.
God’s Law never changes from the time it is given until the end of time.

2 Samuel 6:14-15
David (the royal priest) represents Jesus, the Ark represents Mary, and Jerusalem represents God’s heavenly city.
David’s joy in bringing the Ark of the Covenant into the earthly Jerusalem prefigures the joy of Jesus in bringing Mary’s body into the heavenly Jerusalem.
Let us make sure that we don't receive a curse, like Michal did (2 Samuel 6:16 & 23), by failing to rejoice with Christ that His blessed mother is in the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 7:14
*“I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.”*
By these words God adopted David’s son Solomon long before Solomon was born (2 Samuel 12:24).

God first started the monarchy of His holy kingdom when He created Adam and gave him the authority to rule over the whole earth.  Thus, by default, his wife Eve would be the queen.  But when they brought sin into the world they lost their titles.

God later picked another couple, Abraham and Sarah, who would bring forth Isaac, the earthly son of the promise, and through Isaac would come the new Adam and the new Eve (Jesus and Mary), the king and queen mother of God’s holy Kingdom.

Many centuries later, Solomon, the son of the earthly King David and a descendant of Abraham’s son Isaac, became the son of God through the grace of adoption.  Some years later, when Solomon was crowned king, at his right hand was enthroned his mother, the queen.
This was a prototype of the Heavenly Davidic Kingdom of God.

In the new Covenant, Jesus, the son of God, would become the son of David, through the grace of adoption by Joseph, and at the right hand of Jesus, in Heaven, would be enthroned His mother, the queen and a descendant of David, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom.

What David established, Solomon continued and Jesus fulfilled.
Thus we recognize that establishing a king and a queen to start the monarchy of the new Covenant, was an essential part in God’s Covenant plan for His holy Heavenly Kingdom.
