### Day 136 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 18:9-33
Although David was a good man, with a forgiving heart like God's, he still had his own flaws. Because of his one sin (adultery), his sons also ended up committing sins, up to the extent that his son wanted to usurp the throne from him.  So David had to run away from home and hide from his own son, until his son was killed in battle.

Like David, sometimes we too may be surrounded by people who we think are our own but they connect with us only for what we have, and not because they love us or for who we are and how much we care about them.  At such times we may feel alone and abandoned, but just as God rescued David from the hands of his enemies who were his own, so also God will come to our aid if we are obedient to all His Commandments.

God does not punish children for their parents’ sins (Ezekiel 18:4 & 20) but when we are comfortable living with unforgiven mortal sins then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil’s aim is to destroy families, beginning with our children.  Therefore, if we have committed mortal sins then we must repent, correct our errors, and confess our sins without much delay so that we can keep our souls purified at all times and be a blessing to our children.

### DAY 136 - Shiela

Today's study David spoke as a father, not as a King, ready to forgive, Absalom his son, though it was more than a domestic quarrel. There was pride at the victory over rebellious forces but Absalom's death was a tragic to David. Absalom had three sons.
In Chronicles duties were assigned by David for the construction of the Temple, conducting regular services of morning and evening worship and burnt offerings unto the Lord.
The Psalm is a collection of Wisdom Teachings. HUMBLY submit before the Lord who never abandons His Children. God's children are never completely forsaken, infact, HIS Blessings will extend to the next generation.

### Day #136 The Regret of David is a warning for us to reconcile.

Note: Hit play on the song as you read this reflection.
We have been following the long saga of David’s poor role as a father. David did not act when Amnon raped his step-sister Tamar, David did not act when Tamar was sent away humiliated – he did not help her. Because of David’s inaction - Absalom had to take matters into his own hands and punish Amnon. Indirectly David made Absalom into the beast that he became. David did not make peace with Absalom when he was in hiding. David did not accept him back as a son when he was in the city. Now Absalom is forcefully taking the kingdom from David. David whose praises were sung “Saul slain thousands and David ten thousand ” is now being cursed, stones and dirt is thrown on him.
David is humbled and his heart is starting to repent for his inaction as a father.
“My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. “ 2 Sam 16:11
Today we read David’s instructions to deal gently with Absalom. David has not yet fully accepted him as his son as he calls him, young man.
Later when David hears that Absalom was slain, he breaks down and accepts the fact that he lost a son. He is weeping and repenting probably on his own inaction, weeping over the loss of his son. He even says ‘If only I had died instead of’.
33 The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”2 Sam 18: 33
Let us not regret like David, but let us make peace with all our family and friends before they are no more. We will regret and lament once they are no more. We need to muster the courage, put our pride by the side, and make peace. Make every relationship sweet again, before it is too late.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
