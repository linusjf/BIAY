### Day 136 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 18:9-33
Although David was a good man, with a forgiving heart like God's, he still had his own flaws. Because of his one sin (adultery), his sons also ended up committing sins, up to the extent that his son wanted to usurp the throne from him.  So David had to run away from home and hide from his own son, until his son was killed in battle.

Like David, sometimes we too may be surrounded by people who we think are our own but they connect with us only for what we have, and not because they love us or for who we are and how much we care about them.  At such times we may feel alone and abandoned, but just as God rescued David from the hands of his enemies who were his own, so also God will come to our aid if we are obedient to all His Commandments.

God does not punish children for their parentsâ€™ sins (Ezekiel 18:4 & 20) but when we are comfortable living with unforgiven mortal sins then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devilâ€™s aim is to destroy families, beginning with our children.  Therefore, if we have committed mortal sins then we must repent, correct our errors, and confess our sins without much delay so that we can keep our souls purified at all times and be a blessing to our children.
