### Day 139 Rather be a gatekeeper in the house of the Lord

We read the list of names of the gatekeeper in today‚Äôs readings, one would consider it unnecessary to list them out as they are just gatekeepers. The gatekeeper task would have been a simple task of welcoming people into the temple and also maintaining general law and order, something like the tasks of the Ushers in the church today. However small the task ‚Äì it is a task in the service of the Lord. It is a blessed task even though it may be seen as mundane and menial. The Psalmist says that it is a great role to consider and look forward to.
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than live in the tents of wickedness. PS 84:10
There is joy in the presence of the Lord and it's more fulfilling to even just stand at the door ‚Äì doing service for the Lord. The Psalmist would not trade it for a lucrative job working at the tents of the wicked. We should not think twice about doing anything for the Lord. Even though it may seem unimportant or menial, it is done for a great Lord.
We have many examples among the saints that had simple jobs ‚Äì like those of cleaning the garden or working in the kitchen of the convent. One saint that I would like to highlight is Saint Andr√© of Montreal a saint of our times, was commonly known as Brother Andr√©. He was initially rejected by the order due to his poor health.
"Andr√© was given the task of porter at Coll√®ge Notre-Dame in C√¥te-des-Neiges, Quebec, with additional duties as sacristan, laundry worker and messenger. "When I joined this community, the superiors showed me the door, and I remained 40 years," he said."
"His great confidence in Saint Joseph inspired him to recommend the saint's devotion to all those who were afflicted. On his many visits to the sick in their homes, he would rub the sick person lightly with oil taken from a lamp burning in the college chapel and recommend them in prayer to Saint Joseph."
People claimed that they had been cured through the prayers of the good Brother and Saint Joseph, and they were grateful their prayers had been heard. Brother Andr√© steadfastly refused to take any credit for these cures. Bessette's desire to see Saint Joseph honored led him in 1904 to launch a campaign to build a chapel for that purpose.
"When an epidemic broke out at a nearby college, Andr√© volunteered to nurse. Not one person died. The trickle of sick people to his door became a flood. His superiors were uneasy; diocesan authorities were suspicious; doctors called him a quack. "I do not cure," he said again and again. "Saint Joseph cures." In the end he needed four secretaries to handle the 80,000 letters he received each year."
Let us be inspired by St Andr√© who in a true sense was a doorkeeper at the house of the Lord, the Lord uses the weak things of this world to do great Miracles.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
