### Day #127 Remembering our friends

We know that David and Jonathan – Saul’s son were Best Friends Forever(BFF) – in fact, they would give their lives for each other. Now that David is in a position to pay back to Jonathan – he decides to find Jonathan's kin of Jonathan and ensure they are taken care of.
David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 2 Sam 9:1
When they found Mephibosheth, Saul’s son who was lame in both feet. David summoned him and vowed to take good care of him.
“Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.” 2 Sam 7
We should be inspired to remember our friends of old, to not forget them when fortune favors us.
We should remember all our vows, our marriage vows, the promises we make at baptism to raise good children, the promises we make at confession, to avoid the near occasion of sin, and the promise we make to take care of our parents and families.
It is one thing to read the good dead’s that David did or to make promises, it’s another thing to actually keep them. That is why Jesus said the below.
“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Mat 5:33-37
Jesus wants us to be people of action and not just words. It’s one thing to say “I love you” and another thing to be “Patient, kind, not envious, not proud, not self-seeking, not holding a record of wrongs.”
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Cor 13
Let our "Yes be Yes" and our "No be No". Let us people who keep our word, we should not be all words and no action.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 127 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 12:32
*A group of men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, joined David in Hebron to make him king.*

“Time” (in English) is either Kairos or Chronos (in Greek).
*Chronos time* refers to clock time or calendar time which humans follow, and which is mostly based on the movement of the sun or moon.
*Kairos time* is the right or perfect time when God chooses to intervene to accomplish His divine plan, and there is no fixed earthly date or time for God to intervene.
"Kairos" time can, however, become "Chronos" time after the event takes place and we either mark it on the calendar or remember it by the clock.

The group of men of Issachar understood “kairos” time because they had a close relationship with God (Galatians 5:25).  They were therefore given the knowledge and understanding that according to God’s plan David would rule Israel after Saul since David was already anointed for the same purpose.  Therefore, after the death of Saul, the group of men knew that it was the right time for them to leave the house of Saul and join the house of David.

There may have been “kairos” times in our lives too when God blessed us with miracles.
Our prayers are always heard by God on day 1 but His answers, whether positive or negative, will always come in His “kairos” time.  In the meanwhile, we must continue in our relationship with the Lord with patience.
