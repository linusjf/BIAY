### Day #141 Are you guarding your bean field?

David‚Äôs 3 Mighty Men are Josheb-basshebeth, Eleazar and Shammah.
Josheb-basshebeth he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time
(I mean Wow ‚Äì try to imagine it - killing 800 men at once)
Eleazar ‚Äì He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew, but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword.
(Wow ‚Äì Even though the whole army of Israel withdrew he stood his ground ‚Äì to the point that his hand got stuck to the sword ‚Äì may be due to the heat (metal hits metal) his skin stuck to the sword)
Shammah - Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines. 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory.
What struck me the most was Shammah guarding the field of lentils. He did not move he defended the plot from the Philistines. He stood in the center of the field and defended it until the Philistines fled it. Not all of us are called to do great things like to fight until the sword sticks to our hand or killing 800 men. We may be called to guard the bean field, guard our family. No matter what happens we need to stand our ground and protect our children against everything that comes their way. Never think that our task is too small or insignificant, we are all given different tasks. Take care of your little bean field, do small tasks like keeping the house tidy, doing the dishes, or picking up the kids. These small tasks done with dedication can save lives. Our God is excited when we guard our little bean field, He takes delight when he sees us caring for the people under our care.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
