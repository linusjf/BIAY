### Day #141 Are you guarding your bean field?

David’s 3 Mighty Men are Josheb-basshebeth, Eleazar and Shammah.
Josheb-basshebeth he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time
(I mean Wow – try to imagine it - killing 800 men at once)
Eleazar – He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew, but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword.
(Wow – Even though the whole army of Israel withdrew he stood his ground – to the point that his hand got stuck to the sword – may be due to the heat (metal hits metal) his skin stuck to the sword)
Shammah - Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines. 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory.
What struck me the most was Shammah guarding the field of lentils. He did not move he defended the plot from the Philistines. He stood in the center of the field and defended it until the Philistines fled it. Not all of us are called to do great things like to fight until the sword sticks to our hand or killing 800 men. We may be called to guard the bean field, guard our family. No matter what happens we need to stand our ground and protect our children against everything that comes their way. Never think that our task is too small or insignificant, we are all given different tasks. Take care of your little bean field, do small tasks like keeping the house tidy, doing the dishes, or picking up the kids. These small tasks done with dedication can save lives. Our God is excited when we guard our little bean field, He takes delight when he sees us caring for the people under our care.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 141 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 23:15-17
*David said longingly, “O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”  Then the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the Lord, for he said, “The Lord forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it.*

If David would have drunk the water and satisfied his desire to taste the water of his hometown, this act would probably not have been recorded in the Bible and preachers would not have mentioned it. But David did not want to selfishly enjoy the water which was obtained by the sacrifice of his men.

Like us, Jesus too had a life, but He did not spend His life fulfilling His own desires. He did not focus on His own comfort or luxury. He spent His life caring for others.
As followers of Christ we must live our lives like Him.

When we keep all God given gifts and blessings for ourselves and for our families without sharing with others, those gifts turn into our pride because we are satisfying only our own desires.  Like Jesus, we must go outside our small world, reach out to the needy ones around us, and share whatever we can with them.
