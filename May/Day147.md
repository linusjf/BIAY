### Day #147 He will heal our land

This question has been asked repeatedly through the centuries. Whenever there is an evil act such as a shooting, war, or rape. One usually asks where was God when this evil was happening.
There are times when children are harmed or the venerable are hurt. The question Where was God? This question is trying to show God as incapable of action or not in control of things.
However, the question to ask is why has humanity come to this? God is not the one who is committing evil, the evil starts in human hearts and turns into actions.
God is working with fallen humans, he is trying to get us to the right path, to walk in Jesus‚Äôs steps. Through the centuries of sin, evil, and hatred God is slowly teaching us, humans, the right path. Step by step and little by little.
God gives us the freedom to choose Good over evil, he has always given us freedom starting with Adam and Eve, but we keep choosing evil. It‚Äôs human weakness that has caused so much evil in the world today. However no matter how many times we fail as humans; God invites us, again and again, to repent and go back to him. So that he can restore us back to what we are called to be.
God invites us again as he invited the Israelites under King Solomon.
if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Ch 7:14
We desperately need God‚Äôs healing in our homes, towns, cities, and countries. Let us be united in prayer as we seek God‚Äôs face and as we repent and ask the Lord to forgive us. If we sincerely pray and repent, we will have heaven on earth. God will hear us from heaven forgive our sins and heal our land.
Also remember if we ask God to act with force towards those who commit evil, it will be unbearable and we will be afraid of God. God does not want us to follow him out of fear but out of love.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 147 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Chronicles 7:12-15
\*The LORD appeared to Solomon during the night and said to him, ‚ÄúI have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for my house of sacrifice.‚Äù\*

In the old Covenant God chose the Temple for the prescribed sacrifices to be offered to Him.
In the new Covenant God has chosen the Church for the prescribed sacrifice to be offered to Him.

\*The LORD said to Solomon, ‚ÄúIf I close heaven so that there is no rain, if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, if then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land.\*

God gave Solomon a warning regarding the consequences which he and his people would have to face if they disobeyed God‚Äôs commandments.  But since God is merciful He gave Solomon the solution as well, on how they could overcome the consequences.

But this warning was not only for Solomon and his people.  It is valid for all generations until the end of time.

God is fully aware of whatever sicknesses, disasters, problems, etc. we face on individual level, local level or global level.  He may have allowed it as a test for our faith or most likely due to the increase of the mortal sins of Christians, the ones on whom His name has been pronounced (during baptism).  God does not allow evil unless He can draw some good from it.

During such times God does not wait for us to wake Him up and tell Him to stop or change what is happening.  He waits for us to repent, confess our sins and ensure that our souls are sanctified.  He waits for us to come back to Him and build a relationship with Him.

Let us therefore ensure to repent, confess our sins and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that a misfortune may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death.

On the other hand, if we are leading holy lives according to God‚Äôs Will, then we can continue as we are and we don‚Äôt have to worry about the destiny of our souls in the event of unexpected death.

\*Now, therefore, my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place; for now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart shall be there always.\*

God heard every prayer that went up from the Temple, and God hears every prayer that goes up from the Church as well, but His answer to our prayers will always come in His time, not in the time we expect.

In the old Covenant, God dwelt in the Temple in His divinity.
In the new Covenant, God dwells in the Church in His humanity in the Bread of life / Eucharist, and will continue until the end of time.

2 Chronicles 8:4-8
As commanded by God, the sinful Canaanites were supposed to be driven out of the land or destroyed completely but Solomon didn't do anything like that. Instead he was very soft with them.  Besides imposing heavy taxes on them he didn't make any attempt to get rid of them.  The Canaanites gradually re-introduced idolatry in the country and the Israelites started living sinful lives under their influence thus bringing disaster upon themselves.

Sometimes we too fail to uproot the small sins in our daily lives and we become comfortable living with them. We gradually start convincing ourselves that it is okay to continue as long as we are not harming anyone. Those small sins then gradually progress to mortal sins and we don't even realize when we started walking hand in hand with the devil, thus bringing eternal disaster upon ourselves. Therefore, however small a sin may be, it is always wiser to "nip it in the bud" by making a firm decision to stop it immediately, before it is too late.
