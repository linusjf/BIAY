### Day #147 He will heal our land

This question has been asked repeatedly through the centuries. Whenever there is an evil act such as a shooting, war, or rape. One usually asks where was God when this evil was happening.
There are times when children are harmed or the venerable are hurt. The question Where was God? This question is trying to show God as incapable of action or not in control of things.
However, the question to ask is why has humanity come to this? God is not the one who is committing evil, the evil starts in human hearts and turns into actions.
God is working with fallen humans, he is trying to get us to the right path, to walk in Jesus‚Äôs steps. Through the centuries of sin, evil, and hatred God is slowly teaching us, humans, the right path. Step by step and little by little.
God gives us the freedom to choose Good over evil, he has always given us freedom starting with Adam and Eve, but we keep choosing evil. It‚Äôs human weakness that has caused so much evil in the world today. However no matter how many times we fail as humans; God invites us, again and again, to repent and go back to him. So that he can restore us back to what we are called to be.
God invites us again as he invited the Israelites under King Solomon.
if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Ch 7:14
We desperately need God‚Äôs healing in our homes, towns, cities, and countries. Let us be united in prayer as we seek God‚Äôs face and as we repent and ask the Lord to forgive us. If we sincerely pray and repent, we will have heaven on earth. God will hear us from heaven forgive our sins and heal our land.
Also remember if we ask God to act with force towards those who commit evil, it will be unbearable and we will be afraid of God. God does not want us to follow him out of fear but out of love.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
