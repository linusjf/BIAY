### Day #149 All is vanity

I‚Äôm sure we have come across people who have burnt out their lives trying to amass wealth, houses, cars‚Ä¶ We have seen some perusing fame and popularity ‚Äì doing anything to be on top. We have seen many who try to leave a legacy when they die. Those who want to enjoy all the pleasures that money can buy. None of those will bring us lasting joy, even if we get all the money in the world, all the pleasures in this world, even if we are the most popular person in town. We will not be satisfied. Let me say it again ‚ÄúNothing of this world will satisfy us‚Äù. We have seen so many of the rich and famous commit suicide. Most of them need to be on meds/drugs and are depressed.
We read the story of the King who had it all, all the wealth, wisdom, legacy, pleasures but all of it was but a wind, a vapor, all is vanity.
This King gathered silver and gold, and slaves, built houses, bought vineyards, had singers, wine, and concubines, he had all the wisdom under the sun. The outcome is this piece of wisdom.
‚ÄúThen I considered all that my hands had done and the toils I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun‚Äù Ecc 2:11
If our life was going to end here on earth, then it would be so unsatisfactory. All the things we gather, all the experiences, all the toil, all the pleasures, nothing is long-lasting ‚Äì it will all get blown away in the wind.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mk 8:36
Our life does not end here on earth, our destination is heaven. Live this life focused on the next and you will be satisfied, our focus should be to live a life that pleases God.
‚ÄúFor to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy‚Äù Ecc 2:26
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
