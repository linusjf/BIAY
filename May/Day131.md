### Day #131 Lust does not satisfy

We read this horrendous event of a brother raping his stepsister, it‚Äôs truly very hard to read. Amnon is David‚Äôs son who has a very beautiful stepsister Tamar. Amnon was so obsessed with her that he made himself ill because of the sister. Amnon had a crafty friend who gave him this nasty idea to pretend to be sick just to be with her alone. Amnon forced himself on Tamar because she declined his advances and raped her as he was stronger than her. Something surprising happens after he rapes her, he hates her. He loved her earlier or though he did - he only stiring up lust in his own being.
Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, ‚ÄúGet up and get out!‚Äù2 Sam 13:15
One would assume that he would be happy and satisfied for he got what he wanted. But he only hated her after it, because she reminded him of his brokenness. This is the result when people lust over things and people, it never ends in fulfillment.
When people are looking to gratify their own desires, they are mistaken, they will never be satisfied. It‚Äôs like picking at a healing scab, it gets hurt again and bleeds causing another scab. This continues and the person never heals but the wound gets bigger and bigger. People who are in a relationship just for the pleasure will never be satisfied and we look for other options.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:18
Lust and sexual immorality is a sin that hurts the sinner as he/she is sinner against his/her own body. The Bible asks us to flee from this sin as we are hurting ourselves.
One tires to blame the media, society and the devil for the sins of lust, however it's mostly the desires within that person that is to be blamed.
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death. James 1:14-15
If we let the sin of lust rein in us, we will eventually become spiritually blind and find it hard to come out of the trap, which leads to spiritual death.
Let us love instead of lust. Look for the benefit of the other person and their well-being. The sacrament of marriage celebrates the union of the husband and wife, who are open to life and open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
