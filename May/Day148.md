### Day #148 Enter the Holy of Holies.

As we read through the construction details of the temple, one cannot help but put on sunglasses to look at the temple. It‚Äôs loaded with Gold, tailor-cut stone, and all the fittings, and finishing are of the best quality. If it was still around it would have easily beat the Taj Mahal to the 7 wonders of the world. Picture the most splendid buildings that you have ever seen, and it would fail in splendor to the temple that Solomon built, Solomon was just an instrument the blueprint was given by the Lord.
Even though the temple was ‚Äúout of this world‚Äù it fails in comparison to what Jesus did for us.
In the OT when people made a pilgrimage to the temple to offer sacrifice, they would not be able to go into the holy of holies. They had to visit the temple courts and pray, offer their sacrifice and leave. Only select priests would be able to go into the holy of Holies.
Jesus our new High priest made a way for us, He is both the priest and the sacrifice, He offered himself once and for all. He opened the way for, He is the gate that we can enter to go to the promised land. When Jesus gave up His spirit, the veil of the temple was torn.
Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. Mat 27:50-51
The curtains/veil was the section that separated the common area to the Holy of Holies. Jesus by His life death and resurrection ‚Äì atones for our sins. The tearing of the curtains can be considered symbolic that Jesus made a way for us to enter the Holy of Holies. He gives us full access to God, to the Holy Trinity. We are allowed to enter the Holy of Holies ‚Äì the sanctuary where Jesus is present in the truest form. We no longer must stay outside the temple; we are welcome to go close to Jesus ‚Äì into His presence. In the Holy of Holies of the New Testament, we have Jesus‚Äôs consecrated body ‚Äì He is truly present in each host ‚Äì body blood soul, and divinity (transubstantiation).
Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
Heb 10:19 -20
The next time we enter the church remember that it is such a gift to be able to just walk into the Holy of Holies. Let me say it again ‚ÄúIT IS SUCH A GIFT‚Äù. The price that was paid for our entry into the Holy of Holies is very high, Jesus‚Äôs life death, and resurrection. Let us go rejoicing into Church knowing that we are welcome, we are chosen and God wants us close to Him. The Holy Eucharist even though it looks simple, is spiritually enriching and the brightest and most radiant as it is Jesus, the Light of the world. The temple in all its splendor is just an icon/ a symbol of the every brilliant Jesus. If see all His splendor we will become blind like Saul-Paul, that is why Jesus has pity on us and we are able to look at the host in bread form although it is fully Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

1 Kings 6:7
*The Temple was built of stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or axe or iron tool was heard in the Temple during its construction.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ (John 2:21; Revelation 21:22) therefore God did not want any tool to be used on the Temple site because the Body of Christ was to be scourged and crucified only once.
Also, God does not dwell in noisy places.  God dwells only where there is silence (1 Kings 19:12-13), therefore the construction of the Temple was done with minimum noise.

The stones represent Christians who are like cells in the Body of Christ.
The stones needed to be cut and shaped at the quarry, away from the Temple, till they would be good enough to become part of the Temple.

Similarly, when Christians go away from Christ, because of their mortal sins, they need to be purified through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) outside of the Mass, before they can receive the Eucharist (Communion) (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) to become part of the Body of Christ again.

1 Kings 6:38
King Solomon built the Temple exactly as per the specifications given by God to King David.  If Solomon had modified the specifications to suit his whims and fancies, he would have been disobeying God‚Äôs command and that would have been a disaster because it would have displeased the Lord.  But because he followed every detail which God had given to King David, God was pleased with Solomon and God came to dwell in the Temple.  Solomon‚Äôs Temple therefore came to be known as the most magnificent work, such as was never seen before, because it was the work of human hands done with divine inspiration.

Similarly, the Word of God (the Bible) has been written by human authors with divine inspiration.  Any modification to the Word of God will be a disaster for those who modify it.

### DAY 148 by Sheila

In the Book of Kings, Solomon's Temple, so beautiful was the fulfillment of God's Promise to make a place for His Name to dwell and to give lsrael her own Country a permanent place to Worship God.
The Cherubims were Angels to reflect God's Glory, The Inner Sanctuary, The Most Holy Place, The Presence of God's Dwelling.
Chronicle reveals the Wealth, Wisdom and Extent of Solomon's Kingdom with tremendous Worldwide Recognition.
But Solomon led astray personally, his pagan wives, his entire family was corrupted not following God's Law. The Death of Solomon, was buried with his fathers in the City of David.
The Psalm is of faith and trust in God.. Sacrifices of Righteousness are those offered with the right attitude and God's protection comes to those who put their hope and trust in God.
