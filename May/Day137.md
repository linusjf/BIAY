### Day #137 Joab holding it together for David

When we are going through a difficult patch, maybe the loss of a loved one, sickness, loss of a job, or any difficult situation. We need people to help us walk the right path, amidst our inability to think straight. We see Joab is being very practical here and picking up David‚Äôs drooping spirit.
Due to David‚Äôs inaction as a father, there is a civil war in Israel, Absalom is literally coming to kill David with almost the whole of Israel. Joab takes matters into his own hands and kills Absalom when he found him hanging in the branches of the oak tree, despite David‚Äôs warning to deal gently with him. Now David is mourning the death of Absalom and cannot see clearly the misery that this Father-son tiff has brought Israel, 20K Israelites lost their lives in this civil war.
Joab would have witnessed David‚Äôs mourning and inaction ‚Äì when Amnon raped Tamar and when Absalom killed Amnon. Joab was used to this mourning pattern of David and must have said ‚ÄúNo! not again‚Äù He was able to talk some sense into David and reinstate him as King.
He asked David to focus on what he still has and not on the one son that he lost.
We need friends like Joab who are able to lift up our spirits and help us do the right thing when our vision is blurry due to us being overwhelmed. We need a "Joab" who will fight for us when we are unable to fight, who will reason for us when we are unable to think, and make us move when we are stuck. Let us pray for such friends, who will be a sturdy shelter.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also. Sirach 6:51-17
There is an increase in people with mental conditions like never before. Depression and suicide are on the rise along with mass shootings. These drastic end events like suicide, addiction and mass shootings can be averted if there are enough people like Joab who can keep others on track, and help them look outwards and not at themselves. Most of the mental sickness comes when we focus on ourselves, if we can focus on helping others we will feel much better, and we will be motivated and inspired.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
