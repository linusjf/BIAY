### Day #134 We humans are prone to sin - concupiscence

Earlier Absalom was so zealous to avenge his sister‚Äôs rape, now commits rape. He gets advice from Ahithophel (David‚Äôs previous adviser and friend) who suggests a shameful act to show dominance over David. Absalom sleeps with David‚Äôs concubines in the sight of all of Israel. The one who avenged rape earlier now commits the same sin, shamelessly in public.
David earlier was just and did not lay hands on King Saul even though Saul was envious of him and tried to kill him. This same David is envious of Uriah‚Äôs wife Bathsheba and causes the murder of Uriah.
What becomes clear is that we humans can be good one day and terribly bad another day. We are prone to sin and are not strong, the flesh is weak.
We have to be careful with ourselves, given the opportunity or on a bad day, each of us can be terrible. According to the below excerpt from the CCC we all have an inclination to sin, even though the original sin is washed away in Baptism we are very capable and inclined to sin. The term is ‚Äúconcupiscence‚Äù - an inclination to evil.

CCC 405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called "concupiscence". Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.
Our enemy the devil is always on the prowl, trying to devour us. Let us never leave the side of Jesus, lest we fall into the trap that is set for us.
Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 1 Pet 5:8
May the Angels of the Lord protect and guard our hearts against every evil, harm, and danger.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
