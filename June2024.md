### Day #153 Choosing the right life partner

We see that the wisest man ever, King Solomon has been fooled. He who started off well, listening to God‚Äôs voice and building the great temple and praying for the right things ‚Äì for ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. He knew the wise thing to do and experienced the Lord speaking to him several times in his life, yet he was fooled and mislead by his wives. He had too many of them, 700 wives and 300 concubines. They lead him astray to worship their gods.
Solomon loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter‚ÄîMoabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, ‚ÄúYou must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.‚Äù
As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 1 King 11
Solomon the wisest person should have known that these gods of his wives were simply evil as their worship included child sacrifice and many other evil practices. Also, Solomon was going against the commands of the Lord to not marry women from those places.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord‚Äôs command. 1 Kings 11:9-10
It is a terrible ending that we read about, the wisest man ever has been fooled. His heart is closed to the Lord‚Äôs warnings and at the lowest point of his life.
It is not just wisdom that we need but the will to do the right thing as well.
Like Solomon, we can mess up our lives if we marry the wrong person. We need to be very discerning and careful about the spouse we pick. Marry someone who loves the Lord and is rooted and grounded in the Lord. Go through a discernment process to see if it‚Äôs the Lord‚Äôs plan for the two of you.
Who can find a worthy wife? She is far more precious than pearls.
Her husband entrusts his heart to her, for in her he has an unfailing blessing. Prov 31:10-11
Some very good advice to wives and applies to husbands as well.
Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing; rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God‚Äôs sight. 1 Pet 3:1-5
So when you look for your spouse don‚Äôt only look for looks or jewelry or clothing. Look at how they conduct themselves, look for a genuine spirit and a gentle spirit that loves the Lord. Remember that the Lord has someone in store for you, seek His will.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 153 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 11:1-13
Marriages were designed by God for a God-centered couple (1 man & 1 woman) to raise a family with love.  The purpose of the marriage was never supposed to be for personal gain.  It is a life-time covenantal relationship.  When God or love or couple are missing in the marriage, or the purpose is ungodly, then blessings don‚Äôt pour in.

Solomon started off very well with God-centeredness, couple marriage and love.  In his earlier years Solomon may have loved every single of his wife and he may have been worshipping the living God to keep Him happy, but unfortunately, Solomon‚Äôs purpose for the marriage was not love; it was to gain political alliances (1 Kings 3:1).  He did not maintain the covenantal oath of a marriage to be faithful to one spouse, and in his latter years he even stopped being God-centered.  Just as he multiplied his wives, he also multiplied his gods.

God had patience with Solomon and spared him for the sake of his father, King David, but his descendants had to bear the consequences of his sins (Exodus 20:3-5) and therefore, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was torn apart because God left them, and Rehoboam turned out to be worse than his father Solomon.

Let us make sure we don‚Äôt follow the errors of Solomon in our married lives or else our children may have to bear the consequences of our sins.

The three restrictions given in the Mosaic Law for the future kings was that they must not multiply their Wealth, Weapons and Wives (Deut. 17:14).
But Solomon broke all three articles of the Law by multiplying his Wealth (1 Kings 10:14), Weapons (1 Kings 10:26) and Wives (1 Kings 11:3).
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue (1 Kings 10:28) and married pagan women from the neighboring pagan countries which God had forbidden them from marrying.  The pagan wives later turned Solomon‚Äôs heart away from God by making him worship their false gods.  Solomon loved his wives and therefore in order to please them He displeased the Lord.

*When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other false gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord his God.*

In the Garden of Eden, Eve shared the forbidden fruit with Adam, for a false god, and turned his heart away from the Lord his God.
