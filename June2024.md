### The Decline of Solomon

[![The Decline of Solomon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day153.jpg)](https://youtu.be/P16j_E54TVU "The Decline of Solomon")

### Day #153 Choosing the right life partner

We see that the wisest man ever, King Solomon has been fooled. He who started off well, listening to God‚Äôs voice and building the great temple and praying for the right things ‚Äì for ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. He knew the wise thing to do and experienced the Lord speaking to him several times in his life, yet he was fooled and mislead by his wives. He had too many of them, 700 wives and 300 concubines. They lead him astray to worship their gods.
Solomon loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter‚ÄîMoabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, ‚ÄúYou must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.‚Äù
As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 1 King 11
Solomon the wisest person should have known that these gods of his wives were simply evil as their worship included child sacrifice and many other evil practices. Also, Solomon was going against the commands of the Lord to not marry women from those places.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord‚Äôs command. 1 Kings 11:9-10
It is a terrible ending that we read about, the wisest man ever has been fooled. His heart is closed to the Lord‚Äôs warnings and at the lowest point of his life.
It is not just wisdom that we need but the will to do the right thing as well.
Like Solomon, we can mess up our lives if we marry the wrong person. We need to be very discerning and careful about the spouse we pick. Marry someone who loves the Lord and is rooted and grounded in the Lord. Go through a discernment process to see if it‚Äôs the Lord‚Äôs plan for the two of you.
Who can find a worthy wife? She is far more precious than pearls.
Her husband entrusts his heart to her, for in her he has an unfailing blessing. Prov 31:10-11
Some very good advice to wives and applies to husbands as well.
Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing; rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God‚Äôs sight. 1 Pet 3:1-5
So when you look for your spouse don‚Äôt only look for looks or jewelry or clothing. Look at how they conduct themselves, look for a genuine spirit and a gentle spirit that loves the Lord. Remember that the Lord has someone in store for you, seek His will.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 153 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 11:1-13
Marriages were designed by God for a God-centered couple (1 man & 1 woman) to raise a family with love.  The purpose of the marriage was never supposed to be for personal gain.  It is a life-time covenantal relationship.  When God or love or couple are missing in the marriage, or the purpose is ungodly, then blessings don‚Äôt pour in.

Solomon started off very well with God-centeredness, couple marriage and love.  In his earlier years Solomon may have loved every single of his wife and he may have been worshipping the living God to keep Him happy, but unfortunately, Solomon‚Äôs purpose for the marriage was not love; it was to gain political alliances (1 Kings 3:1).  He did not maintain the covenantal oath of a marriage to be faithful to one spouse, and in his latter years he even stopped being God-centered.  Just as he multiplied his wives, he also multiplied his gods.

God had patience with Solomon and spared him for the sake of his father, King David, but his descendants had to bear the consequences of his sins (Exodus 20:3-5) and therefore, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was torn apart because God left them, and Rehoboam turned out to be worse than his father Solomon.

Let us make sure we don‚Äôt follow the errors of Solomon in our married lives or else our children may have to bear the consequences of our sins.

The three restrictions given in the Mosaic Law for the future kings was that they must not multiply their Wealth, Weapons and Wives (Deut. 17:14).
But Solomon broke all three articles of the Law by multiplying his Wealth (1 Kings 10:14), Weapons (1 Kings 10:26) and Wives (1 Kings 11:3).
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue (1 Kings 10:28) and married pagan women from the neighboring pagan countries which God had forbidden them from marrying.  The pagan wives later turned Solomon‚Äôs heart away from God by making him worship their false gods.  Solomon loved his wives and therefore in order to please them He displeased the Lord.

*When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other false gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord his God.*

In the Garden of Eden, Eve shared the forbidden fruit with Adam, for a false god, and turned his heart away from the Lord his God.

### The Baptism of Jesus

[![The Baptism of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day154.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9xPADpXjRUY "The Baptism of Jesus")

### Day #154 Holy Trinity

As we begin our Messianic Checkpoint with St Mark‚Äôs Gospel. It seems that it‚Äôs a rapid-fire Gospel, as it is the shortest and has fast-moving scenes. Although we can spend years contemplating the mysteries revealed, Mark keeps us moving along with the style of his writing and the repeated use of the word ‚ÄúImmediately‚Äù
The opening scene is John the Baptist preaching a message of repentance and people were getting baptized in the River Jordan. Immediately the focus shifts to Jesus, Jesus is revealed following the words ‚ÄúI have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit‚Äù
Just in the blink of an eye, we see Jesus being baptized. Rather than run with the speed of Mark let us stay here and absorb it all.
First of all, why did Jesus need to be baptized if He is God, did the water purify Him? No he was baptized just to show us the way, His baptism revealed his identity as the Son of God and He did not need to be purified but when he touched the water the waters were made Holy, just as when the unclean leaper(/the women with the flow of blood) touched Him he was not made unclean but they were made clean and whole.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.‚Äù Mark 1: 9
Given that St Marks' Gospel was the very first account of the Gospel, we are reading for the very first time the obvious revelation of the Holy Trinity. We are introduced to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the same scene. All three are divine, and all three are one God. One God ‚Äì three persons.
First of all, this is a mystery and we cannot ever fully understand a mystery. What we need to do is enter into the mystery and experience it, we cannot solve it.
It‚Äôs not a math problem, we cannot say that this math equation ‚Äú1X1X1 = 1‚Äù solves the Trinity equation.
It‚Äôs more of a who God is a thing. We have a Triune God. Father-Son-Spirit who are equal in all aspects and divine in all aspects, totally united and one.
Jesus is not created by the Father, they are of the same substance so to speak, and hence begotten, Jesus is not made, Jesus is not one of the creations that were created in the beginning when the Spirit of God hovered over the void world. There were all present even before creation, for at creation we see the conversation - "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness" and the Holy Spirit hover over the void.
When it comes to the Holy Trinity the best way to understand it is to enter into it. Enter into the mystery and discover it. To fall in love with God, the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the ‚Äúmysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.‚Äù To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel‚Äôs faith before the Incarnation of God‚Äôs Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (CCC 237)
The mystery of the Holy Trinity could be one thing that Jesus said to the disciples ‚ÄúI have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now‚Ä¶‚Äù and promised the Holy Spirit ‚Äúhe will guide you into all the truth‚Äù (16:13). The Church was guided to understand God as Triune.
Let us ask the Holy Spirit to lead us into the mystery of the Holy Trinity ‚Äì Father, Son, and Spirit. So we could be one with God - just as the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.
May the Holy Spirit lead usüôè

### Jesus is Lord

[![Jesus is Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day155.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RLBBThbC7gw "Jesus is Lord")

### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to the people in parables?‚Äù
Jesus‚Äô answer may shock you, let's read it.
‚ÄúTo you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‚Äòthey may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.‚Äô‚Äù
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah ‚Äì when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God‚Äôs forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
‚ÄúThen he said to them, ‚ÄúIs it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?‚Äù But they were silent.‚Äù He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It‚Äôs due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times ‚ÄúWhoever has ears, let them hear ‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It‚Äôs meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don‚Äôt really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as ‚Äì no good farmer will ever sow in these places ‚Äì this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God‚Äôs word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God‚Äôs words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let‚Äôs try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
