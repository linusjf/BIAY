### The Decline of Solomon

[![The Decline of Solomon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day153.jpg)](https://youtu.be/P16j_E54TVU "The Decline of Solomon")

### Day #153 Choosing the right life partner

We see that the wisest man ever, King Solomon has been fooled. He who started off well, listening to God’s voice and building the great temple and praying for the right things – for “wisdom”. He knew the wise thing to do and experienced the Lord speaking to him several times in his life, yet he was fooled and mislead by his wives. He had too many of them, 700 wives and 300 concubines. They lead him astray to worship their gods.
Solomon loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.”
As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 1 King 11
Solomon the wisest person should have known that these gods of his wives were simply evil as their worship included child sacrifice and many other evil practices. Also, Solomon was going against the commands of the Lord to not marry women from those places.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord’s command. 1 Kings 11:9-10
It is a terrible ending that we read about, the wisest man ever has been fooled. His heart is closed to the Lord’s warnings and at the lowest point of his life.
It is not just wisdom that we need but the will to do the right thing as well.
Like Solomon, we can mess up our lives if we marry the wrong person. We need to be very discerning and careful about the spouse we pick. Marry someone who loves the Lord and is rooted and grounded in the Lord. Go through a discernment process to see if it’s the Lord’s plan for the two of you.
Who can find a worthy wife? She is far more precious than pearls.
Her husband entrusts his heart to her, for in her he has an unfailing blessing. Prov 31:10-11
Some very good advice to wives and applies to husbands as well.
Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives’ conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing; rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God’s sight. 1 Pet 3:1-5
So when you look for your spouse don’t only look for looks or jewelry or clothing. Look at how they conduct themselves, look for a genuine spirit and a gentle spirit that loves the Lord. Remember that the Lord has someone in store for you, seek His will.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 153 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 11:1-13
Marriages were designed by God for a God-centered couple (1 man & 1 woman) to raise a family with love.  The purpose of the marriage was never supposed to be for personal gain.  It is a life-time covenantal relationship.  When God or love or couple are missing in the marriage, or the purpose is ungodly, then blessings don’t pour in.

Solomon started off very well with God-centeredness, couple marriage and love.  In his earlier years Solomon may have loved every single of his wife and he may have been worshipping the living God to keep Him happy, but unfortunately, Solomon’s purpose for the marriage was not love; it was to gain political alliances (1 Kings 3:1).  He did not maintain the covenantal oath of a marriage to be faithful to one spouse, and in his latter years he even stopped being God-centered.  Just as he multiplied his wives, he also multiplied his gods.

God had patience with Solomon and spared him for the sake of his father, King David, but his descendants had to bear the consequences of his sins (Exodus 20:3-5) and therefore, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was torn apart because God left them, and Rehoboam turned out to be worse than his father Solomon.

Let us make sure we don’t follow the errors of Solomon in our married lives or else our children may have to bear the consequences of our sins.

The three restrictions given in the Mosaic Law for the future kings was that they must not multiply their Wealth, Weapons and Wives (Deut. 17:14).
But Solomon broke all three articles of the Law by multiplying his Wealth (1 Kings 10:14), Weapons (1 Kings 10:26) and Wives (1 Kings 11:3).
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue (1 Kings 10:28) and married pagan women from the neighboring pagan countries which God had forbidden them from marrying.  The pagan wives later turned Solomon’s heart away from God by making him worship their false gods.  Solomon loved his wives and therefore in order to please them He displeased the Lord.

*When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other false gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord his God.*

In the Garden of Eden, Eve shared the forbidden fruit with Adam, for a false god, and turned his heart away from the Lord his God.

### The Baptism of Jesus

[![The Baptism of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day154.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9xPADpXjRUY "The Baptism of Jesus")

### Day #154 Holy Trinity

As we begin our Messianic Checkpoint with St Mark’s Gospel. It seems that it’s a rapid-fire Gospel, as it is the shortest and has fast-moving scenes. Although we can spend years contemplating the mysteries revealed, Mark keeps us moving along with the style of his writing and the repeated use of the word “Immediately”
The opening scene is John the Baptist preaching a message of repentance and people were getting baptized in the River Jordan. Immediately the focus shifts to Jesus, Jesus is revealed following the words “I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit”
Just in the blink of an eye, we see Jesus being baptized. Rather than run with the speed of Mark let us stay here and absorb it all.
First of all, why did Jesus need to be baptized if He is God, did the water purify Him? No he was baptized just to show us the way, His baptism revealed his identity as the Son of God and He did not need to be purified but when he touched the water the waters were made Holy, just as when the unclean leaper(/the women with the flow of blood) touched Him he was not made unclean but they were made clean and whole.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.” Mark 1: 9
Given that St Marks' Gospel was the very first account of the Gospel, we are reading for the very first time the obvious revelation of the Holy Trinity. We are introduced to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the same scene. All three are divine, and all three are one God. One God – three persons.
First of all, this is a mystery and we cannot ever fully understand a mystery. What we need to do is enter into the mystery and experience it, we cannot solve it.
It’s not a math problem, we cannot say that this math equation “1X1X1 = 1” solves the Trinity equation.
It’s more of a who God is a thing. We have a Triune God. Father-Son-Spirit who are equal in all aspects and divine in all aspects, totally united and one.
Jesus is not created by the Father, they are of the same substance so to speak, and hence begotten, Jesus is not made, Jesus is not one of the creations that were created in the beginning when the Spirit of God hovered over the void world. There were all present even before creation, for at creation we see the conversation - "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness" and the Holy Spirit hover over the void.
When it comes to the Holy Trinity the best way to understand it is to enter into it. Enter into the mystery and discover it. To fall in love with God, the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the “mysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.” To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel’s faith before the Incarnation of God’s Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (CCC 237)
The mystery of the Holy Trinity could be one thing that Jesus said to the disciples “I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now…” and promised the Holy Spirit “he will guide you into all the truth” (16:13). The Church was guided to understand God as Triune.
Let us ask the Holy Spirit to lead us into the mystery of the Holy Trinity – Father, Son, and Spirit. So we could be one with God - just as the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.
May the Holy Spirit lead us🙏

### DAY 154 By Sheila

Today's Study on John the Baptist centered on two messages: The repentance of sins and the Person of Jesus Christ.

At the Baptism of Jesus, The Presence of the Trinity is emphasized. Jesus The Son Of Flesh, The Holy Spirit in the form of a Dove and The Father whose voice was heard from Heaven.

Jesus' miracles primarily called attention to the Offering of the Kingdom. More and more people began to follow.

Jesus knew their thoughts, He forgave their sins and physically healed them. Jesus claimed clear, He does the work only God can do. Therefore, He is God.

Matthew was a tax-collector for Herod Antipas. He received the same invitation as Peter, Andrew, James, John and like the others, who followed Jesus immediately.

In the Psalm, the Psalmist found refuge in the Lord whom he trusted. God loves those who practice righteousness and who make right choices and display right attitudes in life.

### BIAY Day 154 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 1:2-3

\*As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, “See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.”\*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God had promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father so that the new Israel (Jesus) could lead them in their new exodus toward the promised land (Malachi 3:1).

\*“Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”\*

To prepare the way, for the Lord to enter their hearts, the people had to begin with repentance.

God had already prepared the way (a sinless womb) for the arrival of His Son into the world and Mary maintained the sanctity of her womb by ensuring that she always stayed out of sin so she received the Body of Christ into her body in a state of grace.

Like Mary, we too must do our best to remain out of sin at all times so that we can always receive the Body of Christ (Communion) into our bodies in a state of grace.

Mark 1:12–15
\*The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan;\*
God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

Mark 1:35
\*In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.\*

This was *God praying to God* in the early hours of the morning.

By waking up before dawn, going to an isolated place and spending time with God the Father, Jesus gave us a template for prayer.  Jesus gave more importance to His time with God and adjusted His daily schedule in the rest of the time.

Inspite of His busy schedule Jesus always made it a point to spend time with God in solitude.  He expects us to do the same.  However busy we are with our earthly duties and commitments, we must spend sufficient time with God every day.

If Jesus humbled Himself to this level then we cannot make excuses to pray every morning.  We must keep our mornings free for God and fit our daily schedule in the rest of the time.  Our priority must be given to our time with God and not to our daily schedule.

Morning is the best time to pray so that we can start the day with the Lord, and Jesus is the best example (Psalm 90:14; 143:8-10). We can choose to be with the Lord in many ways like going to Church for the morning service or sitting alone in silence and speaking to the Lord, or getting together with family and praying, etc.

### Jesus is Lord

[![Jesus is Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day155.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RLBBThbC7gw "Jesus is Lord")

### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”
Jesus’ answer may shock you, let's read it.
“To you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‘they may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.’”
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah – when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God’s forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
“Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.” He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It’s due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times “Whoever has ears, let them hear ”. It’s not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It’s meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don’t really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as – no good farmer will ever sow in these places – this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God’s word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God’s words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let’s try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 155 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 3:14
*And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles.*

When Jesus chose Judas to be one of His apostles, he was well aware that Judas was a thief.  Inspite of this, Jesus kept Judas in charge of the money collection bag.  Jesus gave Judas the opportunity to change himself and take care of the money bag honestly; but since Judas never had any intention to change himself, he chose to constantly steal money from the bag.

A man does not become a priest by his own wish but only when called by God (Hebrews 5:4).  Therefore, Jesus chose Judas because it was God’s Will.  So along with the good ones, God calls the ungodly ones also.  God allows problems in the lives of the priests so that the good ones can go through spiritual healing and the holy ones can be glorified.  In the meanwhile, the ungodly ones have a chance to mix with the good ones and transform themselves.

Satan used Judas to destroy God’s plan for redemption, but God transformed that evil into good by giving us redemption through the Blood of Christ, according to His plan, exactly as it was prophesied, and thus Jesus (the holy one) was glorified.

A smooth and comfortable life does not prove that a priest or his congregation are worthy to enter the gates of heaven.  We must be tested for trust, obedience to God and righteousness, and God allows Satan to create obstacles in our path.

On the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front.  Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers).  Our duty as Christians is to handle the negative situation using God’s weapons (peace, unity, prayer, fasting, etc.).

Jesus showed us that even though all the Judases may betray Him by committing mortal sins, the Church (the mystical Body of Christ / the saints) will reach the promised land (Heaven), just as the physical Body of Christ did.  We, the beloved disciples, are called to stand with the Church (the Body of Christ), through good times and bad times, to the end (John 19:26).

When we commit a mortal sin, we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified.  Let us therefore ensure to keep our souls purified at all times.

The 12 Apostles didn't have much in common.
Matthew, the tax collector, was working for Rome, whereas Simon, the zealot, was bent on eliminating Rome.   Judas was a thief, and some were fishermen. But surprisingly they were all united in Christ. Whatever their backgrounds they never fought with each other.

Mark 3:27
Jesus came to this area to bind the strong man (Satan) and take back what belonged to God (the man who was possessed by demons).

In the old Covenant, Jesus exorcized the demons from the people by His physical presence .
In the new Covenant, Jesus exorcizes the demons from our souls spiritually through the sacraments.

Mark 3:33-35
*But he said to them in reply, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”  And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”*

Jesus was upgrading all His disciples who believe in Him and obey the Will of God, of whom His Mother was the first and best example.
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to carry the promised Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Jesus asked the question and answered it Himself, thus making it known to all His disciples (present & future), that His mother perfectly fulfilled the role of being His  Mother by her obedience and complete surrender to the Will of God.  The Mother of Jesus is the first Christian who accepted Jesus even before He was born.  By His question and answer, Jesus was also exalting His mother.

### Jesus Casts Out Demons

[![Jesus Casts Out Demons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day156.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gWWwt7YOYOk "Jesus Casts Out Demons")

### Day #156 "Prayer of faith brings healing" , “Do not fear just believe.”

We read this moving story of Jairus and his daughter. The scene opens with a desperate father - Jairus who fell at Jesus' feet begging for the healing of his daughter. While Jesus was on the way to go heal the girl, there was a big crowd around Jesus – many people were touching and pushing Jesus. However, one woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for many years and had spent all that she had but suffered at the hands of the physicians instead of getting healed. According to the customs, she should not touch anyone if not they would become unclean, however, her faith went beyond her reason and she reached out and touched Jesus’ cloak, and immediately after she got healed of her hemorrhage. Jesus stopped and said “Who touched me?” for power went out of Him.
Even though there were many people who were pushing Jesus and touching Him, only the one who touched Him in faith received the healing. Even today when we pray, we sometimes do not have faith, we are just listing out our problems without believing that Jesus can heal us or provide for us -those prayers without faith are just like the crowd that was pushing Jesus, like the crowd that only followed Jesus because their belly was filled with the feeding of the multitude. We ought to make prayers of “faith” believing in our hearts that Jesus will answer them, these prayers of faith touch Jesus.
Never lose hope even if the situation gets worse like that of Jairus, whose daughter died while Jesus was on the way. Jesus encouraged Jairus and said, “Do not fear, only believe”. Jesus entered the house, cleared the place of those mourning, and brought the girl back to life.
So be it with our life, even if it seems that God is not answering our prayers of faith do not give us. Jesus encourages us as he encouraged Jairus “Do not fear, only believe”. Let us not be afraid of anything, even if it seems that all is lost, just trust in Him and have faith. Because Jesus is walking towards us, He is coming to take care of us. “Do not fear just believe.”
Every time we are afraid just say these words Jesus taught Jairus.
“Do not fear just believe.”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Mark 5:4
\*For he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.\*

Inspite of being tied with shackles and chains the man was able to break himself free.

Sometimes we think we are smarter than the evil one and we can fool him easily but we have to remember that the evil one is the most intelligent creature of God’s creation.  More often, than not, with his modern ideologies the evil one makes us walk on his path willingly, with no resistance from us at all. Without the presence of God in our lives we can be easily deceived into thinking that we are walking on the right path.  Whatever we do to get rid of the devil, he will always find a new way to trick us.  But God will be present in our lives only if we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, regularly, and keep our souls purified at all times.

Mark 5:18-20
\*As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  But Jesus refused, and said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.”\*
\*And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.\*

The man wanted to be a disciple of Jesus but Jesus made him a missionary.  After the demons were cast out of the man, and without any experience, he did such a great job of making Jesus known to the people that when Jesus came to that same place the second time there was a huge crowd of gentiles waiting to hear Him preach.

If we keep ourselves purified at all times the Lord will bless us and help us to be little missionaries like that man. We don't need to be scholars or experienced people to do God's work.

Mark 5:21-43
Jairus’s daughter was twelve years old, while the woman had been suffering from haemorrhage for the same length of time (12 years).

At the same moment when Jesus said to the woman, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace” Jairus got news from his home that his daughter had died.  When one daughter was healed, the other one died.

Jairus may have been a synagogue official in that same area where the woman lived.
This is the one and only time Jesus addresses a woman as “daughter.”

Why here? And why now?

Probably, in order to call Jairus’s attention to the fact that he was not the only person there who had a daughter in need of healing.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

If this was indeed the case, we can wonder whether Jairus ever thought about this woman, whether he noticed that she was missing or remembered that she was excluded from God’s house. Perhaps he did not even give her a second thought all these years. But now, at the moment when his daughter lay desperately ill, when time was of the essence to heal her, this same woman delayed Jesus from coming to Jairus's home.
And it is certain that Jairus noticed her when he was with Jesus.

What could have been going on in Jairus’s heart at that moment?
Was he angry at her for delaying Jesus?
Did he want her to just go away?

All those thoughts would have come crashing down in the moment when he heard Jesus call her his “daughter”, and then in the next moment to hear his servant say: “Do not trouble the master: your daughter is dead.”

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God’s daughter for 12 years.

If we are God’s children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members (Christians) during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during Mass.

Mark 6:31
\*People were coming and going in great numbers, so that Jesus and His Apostles had no opportunity even to eat.  So Jesus said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.”\*

Jesus wanted the disciples to rest physically so that they could reflect spiritually on their mission.  He wanted them to guard themselves against burnout.
God wants us to work for six days and rest on the seventh day because the seventh day must be dedicated to spending time with God, and Satan uses fatigue to separate us from God and our families.  Fatigue causes irritation which leads to anger and thus disturbs the peace and happiness around us.

When the devil can’t make us bad, he makes us busy, because God does not speak to us when our bodies and minds are busy.  God speaks to us (through our thoughts) only when our bodies are relaxed, our minds are at peace and there’s silence around.

### DAY 156: By Sheila

In today's Study, Jesus reached out to the Gentiles even in seemingly hopeless situations. Healing demon possessed cases of powerful evil forces, apparently of fallen angels who are part of Satan's rebellious ones. They work in the arena of the mind, causing people to believe lies and  embrace worldly wisdom.

Jesus always commanded them to depart. The void left in the person's life was to be filled by New Life, the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to walk in the Holy Spirit fullness.

The bleeding unclean woman, when she touched Jesus, He made her clean. All who came to Him had seen the miracles and heard life-changing teachings.

Many heard the circumstances surrounding His Birth and rejected Him, His hometown as well. Jesus equipped those who believed Him and sent them to do the work of the Kingdom.

John the Baptist refused to cover the adultery of Herod Antipas and Herodias. John was finally beheaded and put to death. The family was ruthless. He even stole his brother Philip's wife.

The feeding of 5,000 that Jesus performed was to verify that the Kingdom was being offered, provision for feasts, A training for His Disciples, A mission to feed the hungry with the little they had.

JESUS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD would supply all needs.

The Psalm is a thanksgiving for God's Blessings. The God who has brought Victories to His People ALWAYS, in the past, could be trusted to grant our future victories too.

### Following Jesus

[![Following Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day157.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HxrIRpRoTgY "Following Jesus")

### Day #157 Jesus is the Good Shepherd described in Psalm 23

As we read Psalm 23 through the lens of the New Testament. We see Jesus as the fulfillment of the promise of the Good Shepherd. There is an explicit comparison in John 10 where Jesus is proclaimed the “Good Shepherd”. Let us go through this beautiful psalm 23 verse by verse.
“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures;”
We see that Jesus meets our biggest need, our need for redemption. We needed forgiveness of sins and needed a savior. That is when Jesus the good shepherd laid down his life to save us. We now can lie down in the green pastures of heaven, there are no tears or pain or suffering in heaven – we will be full with the presence of the Lord.
Jesus will supply all our needs on earth as well – whenever Jesus encountered anyone during His earthly life – they never went back empty-handed – they received healing, teaching, deliverance, and physical food as well. Jesus supplied all their needs and will supply all our needs as well. We shall not be in want.
“he leads me beside still waters;”
We read in the Gospels that Jesus was able to still the raging storms and even walk on water and encourages Peter to walk on the water. Jesus knows that our lives are filled with worries and burdens, hence he invites us “Come to me and I will give you rest” – He will lead us through still waters and give us rest.
“he restores my soul.”
Jesus came to restore the relationship of man with God. He restores our souls to the father. Whenever Jesus healed anyone – he also made them whole, forgave them their sins, and said do it no more. He is restoring everyone’s soul to the state of no sin.
“He leads me in right paths for his name’s sake.”
As a good shepherd he calls us by name, His own hear his voice and follow Him. We are his sheep and He is our good shepherd. He not only leads us on the right path but is the right path. “He is the gate and the way”.
“Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I fear no evil; for you are with me;”
Even if we lose our way, Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 and goes looking for the 1 lost sheep. Once found He binds our wounds and restores us back to the flock. We need not fear for Jesus promised us that He is with us till the end of ages. Even if we go through tough times we should not fear “Fear Not, only believe”
your rod and your staff— they comfort me.
Jesus comforts us from the Cross, He pleads for us and asks the Father to forgive us our sins. Jesus suffers for us on the Cross and gives us the courage and suffers with us when we go through tough times on earth. The wooden staff can be compared to the cross and the rod can be compared to the sphere that pierced his side, blood and water poured out to the whole world, forgiving us.
“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;”
This good shepherd at the last supper instituted the Eucharist. He asks us to remember him at the table of the altar. He said – “do this in memory of me.”
you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Our cup will never run dry as Jesus does not give us earthy water but the living water, the Holy Spirit that whelms up within our hearts. We are anointed by the Holy Spirit with a font that is ever-flowing, never-ending.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
Jesus’s Mercy and goodness are ever-present to us. He never rejects us no matter how bad our sin is, we are always welcome to approach the Mercy seat of Jesus, for he knows our weakness and is able to sympathize with us.
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord my whole life long.
One thing that we can be sure of is Jesus’ presence in our lives. He is Emmanuel – God with us. Rather than us going up to the temple in Jerusalem, Jesus comes to us at every Church in the form of the Holy Eucharist. He is always present to us, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts. If anyone lets me in, I will come in and dine with them.
May we love Jesus our Good shepherd and welcome Him into every part of our lives.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Mark 7:1–13
*And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?”*

Jesus did not condemn all traditions; he condemned only erroneous human traditions, whether doctrines or practices, that undermined God’s truths. He instructed his followers to abide by the traditions that are not contrary to God’s commandments.  And, as the Apostles taught (1 Corinthians 11:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:15), the rest are to be obeyed.

Mark 7:24-30
\*She came and bowed down at his feet.\*

By bowing down at His feet / kneeling before Him, the gentile woman was acknowledging the divinity of Jesus.
Jesus first ignored the lady but she persisted in her request.  Inspite of being a Canaanite she worshipped him by calling him “Lord.”

She humbled herself in front of a Jew.  She was desperate because her child was being tormented by a demon and she knew the situation was out of her control.

When our children go far away from God it is best to place our children in God's hands because we cannot fight demons, only God can.  Meanwhile, we must continue making efforts to improve our own spiritual life while we also pray for our children. If we use our human efforts to solve the problem it can turn into a disaster.

\*Jesus said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”\*

The Israelites are the children of God (Exodus 4:22-23; Deut. 14:1; Isaiah 1:2).
Jesus compared the woman to a dog because He wanted to bring out her faith.
It may sound like Jesus was being rude to the woman, but that is exactly how it feels when our faith is being tested.

When Jesus compared the woman to a dog, she had two options :

1. she could allow her pride to control her, take the response of Jesus as an insult and leave Jesus, OR,

2. she could humble herself and accept that she was not the greatest.

If she chose Option 1, then, because of her pride, her daughter would have to live with the demon all her life.
But the Cannanite woman made a wise choice.  She chose Option 2, and Jesus healed the child because of the faith, humility and persistent prayer of the mother.

The tests, for our faith in Christ, don’t come on a bed of roses. They are usually rocks and thorns which come in the form of rejections, insults, criticisms, humiliation, false accusations, etc.
If we look at them positively then our humility will help us to see God working through them to heal us spiritually.  But if we look at them negatively then our pride will only show us how we have been demoralized, disrespected, hurt, etc.  In other words, our pride will show us that we are the god who was not given importance.

The Canaanite woman, however, did not look at the response of Jesus as negative or rude. In her humility she accepted her comparison to a dog and replied appropriately.

Let us learn from the Cannanite woman to humble ourselves and choose our words wisely when we communicate with others.

\*But she answered him, “Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”\*

It is, and always has been, an insult for anyone to be compared to a dog (Philippians 3:2; Revelation 22:15).
These words of the gentile woman being accepted by Jesus was an assurance for the first century gentiles that the Bread of salvation was available, not only for the Jews, but, also for the gentiles.

Crumbs are left-overs.
The children are the people of God whom Jesus came to feed with the heavenly bread, but if the Jews don't want the Bread of Life then the gentiles will starve because there won’t be any crumbs.

Similarly, if Christians don’t live in a state of grace then the Bread of Life which they eat is no good (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) therefore the non-Christians will suffer because Jesus will not save the world through Christians whose light does not shine.

\*Then he said to her, “For saying this, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”\*

Sometimes when we feel that our children have spiritually declined or gone far away from God, let us remember that the Cannanite woman’s daughter was freed from the demon because of her mother’s faith, humility and persistent prayer, and, like the Cannanite woman, let us pray persistently for our fallen away children.
Like the despised Cannanite woman, however sinful we parents may be, God will surely answer our prayers and spiritually heal the souls of our fallen away children, if we make an attempt to increase our own faith in God and be humble always.

Mark 7:33
\*He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.\*

Jesus could have just said the word and the man would have been healed, but He chose to use a sacramental procedure to perform this miracle.

A sacrament is an outward sign of an inward grace.
Jesus used His saliva and fingers for grace to flow into the man. The man could have felt disgusted and backed away but it was his humility that made him accept the method which Jesus was using.

By performing this miracle sacramentally, Jesus was also preparing His Apostles for the Last Supper where He was going to offer His Sacramental Body and Blood in atonement for our sins, so that they would understand how God's grace flows into humans through materials when they would do the same after Pentecost Sunday.

### The Reality of Sin

[![The Reality of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day158.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SMPDppmKYVY "The Reality of Sin")

### Day #158 The Transfiguration - a Theophany

The Transfiguration is one of those events in Jesus’ life that we are very familiar with. Sometimes being too familiar causes us to overlook certain things. The purpose of the Transfiguration as most of us know is to reveal Jesus’s divinity. We know Jesus is divine and we read everything else based on this knowledge.
But for the apostles and first-century Jewish and pagan people, they are discovering the fact that Jesus is actually divine.
Mountain:
The first item to analyze is the “Mountain” Jesus takes Peter, James, and John up the mountain. As we have been studying the OT we know that the Mountains are symbolic for God experiences – Moses goes up the mountain to encounter the Lord face to face (although he does not see God face to face, but was able to see the glory of God as God passed by) Also Mount Zion is the place where they went up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple built by King Solomon.
When Jesus took them up the Mountain, they would have known that there is going to be a God experience – a “Theophany”.
Moses & Elijah:
Now, wait a minute what are they doing here in the NT. We know that Moses is dead and Elijah was taken up into heaven. The thing that is common between the two is they both went up a mountain to meet God, they had a Theophany. Moses represents the Law and Elijah represents the Prophets. We know that both Moses and Elijah had to hide their face in the OT – Moses saw the back for God and Elijah hide his face when he recognized God in the wind, but now we see them “talking” to Jesus. They were unable to see the glory of God, but now Jesus bridges the gap and we human beings can speak to God.
Bright Clothing, Voice, and Cloud:
Jesus’ “garments” became “glistening” or intensely white. This is symbolic that He is divine, this was the way heavenly creatures were represented. Jesus gives the apostle a glimpse of the hidden glory hidden under his human flesh. We also hear the voice of God – affirming that Jesus is God.
“This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”. The cloud mentioned here represents the presence of God, just as it used to come down in the temple/tabernacle/ holy of holies – and everyone was in awe and could not even enter the temple. Similar to the experience that Mary had when the Holy Spirit overshadowed her at the annunciation. Looks like Peter James and John experienced this Theophany - an encounter with God, where Jesus is revealed to them as God, a God that we can talk to.
Booths
Peter made an interesting recommendation to build 3 booths. What he seems to be referring to here is the feast of the booths. We have read about it in Exodus where they would make tents/booths/tabernacles and stay in them, feasting on the fruit of the harvest – as an icon of the resurrection. Peter is carried away and thinks it's already Resurrection.
Hope this helps us enrich our experience of the Transfiguration. May we have a Theophany experience the next time we go to adoration.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏

Mark 9:5 & 9
Peter was ecstatic for a short while, when he saw the glorious heavenly scene, but eventually he had to leave the place and go down the mountain.

Sometimes when we experience small miracles in our lives or when we are engaged in prayer and meditation with the Lord in solitude and silence, we may feel so ecstatic that we don't want that moment to end but the reality is that we are still in this world and we will have to face challenges often.

Mark 9:28-29
\*When he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”  He said to them, “This kind can come out only through prayer and fasting.”\*

Prayer is a radical acceptance of our dependence on God.
Fasting is not observed to experience hunger or to punish ourselves by starving our bodies.
Fasting is observed to remind us that our existence and sustenance is dependent on God, and not on the material food which we eat (Deut. 8:3).

An exorcist priest must be in a state of grace, with prayer and fasting included, before performing an exorcism because the devil knows exactly who is in a Covenant with God and who is not, otherwise it can be very dangerous for the priest while performing the exorcism (Acts 19:13-16).

Mark 9:37
\*Whoever receives one child like this in my name, receives me.\*
When Christians bring forth children as a gift from God, they receive Jesus into their Christian homes.  When they refuse to bring forth children they are refusing Jesus.

Mark 9:38-39
\*John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.”\*

The seventy elders who received God’s Spirit through Moses were a shadow of the ministry of the Apostles (Numbers 11:16-17).
Like Joshua (Numbers 11:25–29), John too made the mistake of presuming that only a select few are inspired and entrusted to carry out God’s plans.
The disciples exhibited a worldly sense of competition regarding the spiritual ministry of exorcism.
They wanted their power to be exclusively for themselves and they wanted to be the exclusive channel of God’s grace.

The Spirit blows where it wills (John 3:8), and God desires to bestow His Spirit on all His people in every nation under Heaven (Acts 2:5, 38).
God can, and will, work mighty deeds through the most unexpected and unlikely people. All of us are called to perform even our most humble tasks, such as giving a cup of water, for the sake of the Lord’s name and the cause of His kingdom.

Often, like Joshua and John, perhaps without noticing it, we cloak our failings and fears under the guise of our desire to defend Christ or the Church.
But as Jesus says, instead of worrying about who is a real Christian and who is not, we should make sure that we ourselves are leading lives worthy of our calling as disciples (Ephesians 1:4).
We need to keep meditating on God’s Law. We need to pray for the grace to detect our failings and to overcome them.

Mark 10:2-12
Why did Jesus forbid divorce and re-marriage?
A Christian marriage is a sacrament because it is a union between two baptized persons.  Marriage is a Covenant relation, and Covenants are lifetime spiritual bonds.

In a Christian marriage, man is a symbol of Jesus and woman is a symbol of the Church (Ephesians 5:23-24).
The Church is the bride of Christ and was created to be with Jesus forever just as woman was created to be with her spouse for lifetime.  Therefore, God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16).

In the old Covenant, divorce and remarriage (Deut. 24:1-3 or 4) were permissible because the old Covenant Temple was only a temporary symbol of the Body of Christ.  The new Covenant Church (the Christians) is the true bride of Christ and just as Jesus and His bride (the Church) are inseparable, so also man and wife must never divorce.  When a Christian couple divorce they break the sacred bond.

What God has put together, no one can separate (Mark 10:9), therefore divorce does not erase the lifetime marriage Covenant vows.  Thus, divorcing our spouse and marrying another is considered as adultery because, by the marriage Covenant vows, we are joined to our first spouse until death separates us.

Jesus reminded the people that divorce was never in God's plan for humanity from the beginning.  Jesus therefore forbade divorce (Mark 10:9), and if a couple must separate due to unavoidable circumstances, it is NOT a permission for them to re-marry (Mark 10:11-12; 1 Corinthians 7:10-11).

Jesus revealed that marriage is a divine, life-giving sign. Through the union of man and wife, God intended to bestow His blessings on the human family, making it fruitful, multiplying it until it filled the earth (Genesis 1:28).

### Bearing Fruit

[![Bearing Fruit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day159.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CCyJ2WtJ2Gk "Bearing Fruit")

### Day 159 The Fig tree from Genesis.

The day after Jesus enters Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, we see Jesus cursing the fig tree. It seems kind of odd, as though Jesus is having a bad Monday. The Gospel says ‘for it was not the season for figs’ Mark 11:13 – why would Jesus expect figs when it’s not fig season.
Before the deeper analysis, we should ask ourselves the obvious. Why would Jesus curse a tree that had no fruit? One obvious reason would be the lack of fruit.
We are called to bear fruit and be fruitful. Jesus did use the example of tree and fruits a few times – like the one where the good tree bears good fruits, and the even tree bears evil fruits. Also about the vine and the branches, the branches that do not bear fruit will be removed and the branches that bear fruit will be pruned to bear more fruit. Another one was the parable of the barren tree where the gardener pleads for one more year. The idea of a tree and its fruit is not new to the Jews, prophet Isaiah had warned them about the Vineyard that yielded wild grapes instead of good ones. So whenever Jesus used these parables they would have almost immediately latched on to the idea.
Let’s take a different look at the cursing of the fig tree today, Jesus curses a fig tree why only a fig tree and not a palm tree or olive tree. One connection that we can make is the fig tree from Genesis. Although no fig tree is mentioned, we have a mention of the fig leaves.
Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7
Most paintings of the original sin have the apple as the fruit that was eaten by Eve and then Adam. However, this may be a painter’s imagination as there is no mention of an apple tree in Genesis. The only description of a fruit tree can be taken from the fig leaves. If the tree that our first parents ate from is a fig tree, it kind of makes some sense that the new Adam Jesus – did not eat the fruit, instead, he cursed the tree and said to it
“He said to it, ‘May no one ever eat fruit from you again.’ And his disciples heard it.” Mark 11:14
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
Jesus came to destroy sin and set us free from sin. That is why he said may no one ever eat the fruit of the tree of sin. He came to liberate us, to give us forgiveness and the power to avoid sin. We are called to bear fruit of holiness and fruit of the Spirit which are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control(Gal 5:22)
Soon after the fig tree cursing Jesus entered the temple and cleansed it, Jesus is most certainly targeting sin, the original sin of disobedience. We have not only eaten the forbidden fruit but made God’s temple a trading place. Like the temple authorities, we tend to shift the focus from the worship of God to earthly things.
Finally, we see Jesus telling the parable of the wicked tenants where a man planted a vineyard and leased it out to tenants who seized and killed many of the owners’ servants. The twist in the parable comes when the owner sends his only son, instead of an army. Jesus is describing his own life death and resurrection – one hint would be that in the parable the son was cast out of the vineyard and killed referring to Jesus' crucifixion outside the city of Jerusalem.
Let us be encouraged by what Jesus did for us, He come to this world and cursed sin, then sacrificed his own life for us and we now have a new tree of life, the cross.
The New Adam - Jesus does not eat of the fruit of the tree, but curses it and institutes the new tree of life - the cross
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Mark 11:2
*You will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden.*

Why bring a colt that has never been ridden?
Because it was in line with God's command to Moses:
An animal meant for sacred purpose was not to be put to any profane use (Numbers 19:2).  But that was only a shadow of the reality.

The womb that bore Jesus was meant to be exclusively for Him.
The tomb where He was buried was meant to be exclusively for Him.
Similarly, He would ride a colt that was meant to be exclusively for Him, while on His way to Jerusalem to be received by His people as their King.
This was God’s Will to emphasize the divinity of His Son.

Mark 11:11
*Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple area.*

A victorious earthly king of an earthly kingdom would normally enter his palace and sit on the throne after his people welcomed him with joy, but Jesus was the heavenly King of a holy Kingdom and therefore He entered the Temple after He was welcomed.

Mark 11:13-14
God’s people, who are spiritually fruitful, are like good figs and will be rewarded.  Those who fail to be spiritually fruitful are like the bad figs and will be destroyed (Hosea 9:10; Jeremiah 24:8-10).

Mark 11:15-16
*Jesus made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ.  Even if it was a shadow it was sacred because it was consecrated.  Jesus noticed that the Sanhedrin had profaned the Temple by permitting the people to use it as a marketplace.
He therefore purged out what was wrong and then taught them to do what is right.  He drove out those who profaned the Temple and showed displeasure at those who turned the place of worship into a place for worldly gain.

The Church building too is a sacred place because it is consecrated but the Church is the real Body of Christ.  The Bishops and Pastors must take care to ensure that they do not permit the people to use the Church building for ungodly purposes or else they will be profaning it.

Our bodies are Temples of the Holy Spirit because we are consecrated (baptized).  Therefore, we must ensure to detach ourselves from worldly things and purge out all our sins  by receiving the Sacrament of Reconciliation so that we can be in a state of grace before we receive the Body of Christ (Communion)  (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Mark 12:41-44
The poor widow possessed only two coins and had nothing else to live on.  Yet, without any hesitation she gave all that she had, to support God’s priests in the Temple.
This may have reminded Jesus of His own widowed mother, whose only support for her livelihood was her one son.  Nevertheless, she too willingly offered Him completely to serve God, without asking for any benefits for herself and without thinking of herself and her future.
In appreciating the widow with the two coins, Jesus deeply appreciated His own mother’s sacrifice.

Some centuries ago, the widow in Zarephath, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah and the promise of his Lord.  Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family (1 Kings 17:10-16).

These poor widows were not successful in their material lives, yet they gave all that they had, unselfishly, even though they were left empty handed and not sure when their next meal was going to come.  They willingly gave because they wanted to please God, not humans.  They mirror the love of God the Father in giving His only Son, and Christ’s love in sacrificing Himself on the Cross.

God sees everything and He also sees what we offer.  He is interested only in the quality of our offerings, not the quantity.  God sees our heart when we offer.

A Church parish which is made up of selfish and comfortable Christians, cannot stand for long.  The parish flourishes only when we Christians, who are cells in the Body of Christ, take care of the Priests and the less fortunate ones, which is one of the fundamental aspect of our Christian life.  If we say we love God but our love for God does not convert into caring for others and generous giving to the Kingdom of God on earth, then our love for God is fake love.

Whatever we possess all belongs to God (Psalm 24:1) and we don’t take anything with us when we die (1 Timothy 6:7).
So let us not be selfish with our giving.  Let us keep our eyes and ears open so that we can be aware if God is telling us or showing us who He wants us to help.

### Day #160 Watch and pray

There is a great necessity to be watchful and to sustain in prayer. Jesus tells us the parable of the man who leaves home and puts his servants in charge. The servants should be doing their work as no one knows the hour when the owner will return, lest he finds them asleep when he returns. We have these words of Jesus that we should take seriously “Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time will come.”
Our frail human nature does not make it easy for us to follow this teaching, we are easily distracted and find it hard to stay focused on prayer. Like Peter, James, and John at Gethsemane, we keep dosing off. Jesus was sorrowful and struggling in prayer He said “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death, remain here and watch”. In the Gospel of Luke, there is a mention that “Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground”. Even though Jesus is going through such suffering, the disciples find it hard to even pray for Him.
Jesus said “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you do not fall into temptations; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak”
Jesus found them sleeping two more times, their eyes were very heavy and they could not pray. Jesus asked Simon to pray three times and we know that Simon fails to pray three times. Had he prayed those three times, he would have probably had the strength to overcome his fear and would not have denied Jesus three times.
Most of us are weak because we do not pray, Jesus has overcome the world and wants us to live a victorious life. However, we are unable to pray and hence unable to reject sin. We have no power in us because we have little or no prayer life. Let us make time for prayer, even if it means waking up an hour earlier than everyone else. Spending an hour in holy adoration or attending weekday Mass. Let us pray and be strong. Watch and pray so that we will be in the state of grace when Jesus comes or when we die and go up to meet Him as the just judge. “Watch and pray!!” let’s say it again “Watch and pray!!”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

This prophecy is associated with Zechariah 14:4 (the day of the Lord) which says that the Messiah would come when the end is near.
The purpose of this chapter is to prepare the Church for a period of distress, trials and persecutions before the second coming of Christ. The proper Christian attitude should be not to panic or to be alarmed, but to persevere in faith till the end.

Jesus was speaking of two destructions:  the Temple and the city.

The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe.  The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.
Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city.  It was a Temple with a city around it, but it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).

Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city.  It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it.  The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally.

Mark 13:33
*Jesus said, "stay awake, be alert and pray for you know not when the time will come."*

Let us make sure to remain in a state of grace at all times by receiving the sacraments of Reconciliation and Communion regularly, so that we will always be prepared to go with the Lord whenever He comes to take us.
Let us always be alert to sins of all kind so that we can avoid committing them.

Mark 14:1-2
*It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread.*
God had given these two festivals to the Israelites as two separate feasts but during the time of Jesus they were both being celebrated together as desired by God.

Both feasts of the old Covenant were shadows of the Unleavened Bread (Communion) and Passover (Mass) of the new Covenant which Jesus inaugurated in the Upper Room and finished on Calvary and thereafter gave them to the Church to be celebrated until the end of time.

*The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him; for they said, “Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.”*
Everything was going according to God's divine plan and God allowed the evil ones to go ahead with their plan so that God’s plan would be fulfilled.
On the day and hour when the earthly lambs would be slaughtered for the old Passover to commemorate the physical liberation of the people of the old Israel from the evil Pharaoh, on the same day and hour the heavenly Lamb of God (Jesus) would be killed for the new Passover to spiritually liberate the baptized people of the new Israel (the Church) from Satan.

Mark 14:7
*For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.*
Jesus was not confirming that poverty will flourish.
Jesus was reminding us of the words of Moses (Deut. 15:11).
By serving the poor we serve God.

Mark 14:22-24
*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

The priest consumes the bread and wine separately because that is how Jesus gave it to them in the Upper Room.  The sacrifice is complete only when the priest consumes both.

*This is my body ...........; This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said “Amen.”
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

When God speaks, His Word does not return empty.  His words accomplish what is spoken (Isaiah 55:11; Genesis 1:3).

Therefore, when Jesus said, "this is my body” and “this is my blood" the bread and wine became His mystical Body and Blood.
In the old Covenant, the earthly lamb was a symbol and it died after it was slaughtered, therefore it did not have the power to give the people eternal life when they received it.
In the new Covenant, by His life, death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus put the power of the Holy Spirit in the heavenly Lamb (of God) therefore this Lamb can give us eternal life when we receive it in a state of grace because this Lamb is still living even though He died after He was slaughtered.

The words of consecration can be repeated by anyone, but the transubstantiation takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit only when an apostolic priest says the exact words in obedience to the command of Jesus because the authority was given only to the ordained apostles, who in turn must give that same authority to their apostolic successors.  Therefore, if any other person repeats the words of consecration the bread and wine will still remain bread and wine; they will not be transformed.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice.  Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real.  Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired.  By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

Mark 14:44-46, 50, 66-71.
*All 12 apostles received their priestly ordination (Holy Orders) in the Upper Room and all 12 of them had the Eucharist (Communion) but shortly after that Judas betrayed Jesus, Peter denied Jesus and the remaining 10 abandoned Jesus.*
Receiving Communion or any other sacraments is not a guarantee that the devil will stop tempting us to follow him.  One mortal sin is enough for the devil to start controlling our thoughts, words and deeds, and make us use our bodies (eyes, ears, tongue, hands, etc.) for sinful purposes.  He has a million ways to fool us into committing sins.  We must, therefore, remain alert to sin until the last day of our lives and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation whenever we fail.

*Jesus was taken away from the Apostles after Judas betrayed Him.  Thereafter the apostles were scattered by Satan.*
When we betray Jesus with our sins, God leaves us.  This automatically puts us in the hands of Satan whose aim is to destroy families and communities and eventually the Church, by causing division between the members and scattering them.
Let us make sure to resolve our problems peacefully and stay united with our family members as well as with our Christian community, irrespective of our differences.

### The Crucifixion of Christ

[![The Crucifixion of Christ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day161.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Inche74z-L8 "The Crucifixion of Christ")

### Day #161 My God my God why have you forsaken me

The most difficult part of Jesus’ suffering would have been the separation from the Father and the Spirit. When Jesus took our sin upon Himself, he would have felt all the guilt that every human has ever felt. When we sin, we feel separated from God as though God is far away or angry with us. When Jesus took on the cup of suffering our sin, He suffered and died for us. Sin cost the very life of God. The Holy Trinity is so united in love that the pain caused to the Father and the Spirit to see the Son suffer is unthinkable. Although Jesus wasn’t abandoned by God, He probably felt what we human beings feel when we commit sin. The effects of sin are terrible, and we can see it manifest in the cross, where the purest one suffered for us all.
The other reason Mark used this verse was the point to Psalm 22 where we see the suffering of David(or any human being for that matter). Also, the Psalm is fulfilled in Jesus' passion “I am a worm and no man scorned by men and despised by the people”, “I am poured out like water” “my heart is like wax” and “they pierced my hands and my feet”.
Suffering is part of life, and no one can avoid it. Suffering is in fact the way to the cross, to salvation. We are called to embrace suffering and not flee from it, pick up our cross and follow Him daily. We may feel abandoned or feel that God is not answering our prayers. However remember as Jesus rose from the dead, we will also rise above our suffering if we accept it. We may feel like running away from our sufferings and even pray like Jesus “May this cup pass from me”, but the only way forward is to accept our crosses. He will not let us be tested beyond our capacity, remember that Jesus is with us even though we may feel that we have been abandoned.
“ And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” Mat 28:20
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel

[![Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day162.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PnluN3nNDUc "Rehobo'am Seeks Counsel")

### Day #162 Kings/Politicians use their power to lead people away from God.

We should always remember that Israelites were the ones who wanted a King. Earlier God was their King, leading them with fire and smoke and speaking to them through their leaders Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and Jacob. Even though God knew the Kings would eventually dominate the Israelites and misuse their power, He gave them what they asked for. We learned about King David, the high points and low points in his life. King Solomon the builder who built the beautiful temple, the wise man who stored up a lot of wealth. He misused his wisdom to impose high taxes on the people and made them work really hard as he used that money to build temples for his pagan wives' gods.
One would think that his son would be more sensitive to the people but turns out that Rehoboam did not take the counsel of the older/wiser men. Rehoboam listed to his friends – or rather the ones who listen to him.
“My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions”
Rehoboam is God’s anointed king yet so corrupt and evil, that the people literally drive him out of Israel(Northern) and he goes to the smaller part of Israel(Judah).
Now, remember every Jew had to go to the temple in Jerusalem to worship. Jeroboam(Solomon’s other son who came back from exile after his death) the king of the North did not want people going to the south to worship lest their hearts turn to God and they decide to follow the anointed king Rehoboam. So Jeroboam does the unthinkable – he establishes his own religion – he builds Golden calves for people to worship in the North. We can see how power has caused these Kings to reject God and his goodness.
In our more modern history, we have seen Kings going against the true church. King Henry VIII started the process of creating the Church of England after his split with the Pope in the 1530s. Henry was anxious to ensure a male heir after his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had borne him only a daughter. He wanted his marriage annulled in order to remarry. This boosted Protestantism and many wealthy people left the catholic church because they did not want to displease the king, the poor people were afraid of the fines put on them.
There are numerous examples in our history and present-day Politicians where God is rejected just so that those in power can get what they want. May we not be afraid but follow our conscious and do what is right in the sight of God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 162 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 12:12-17
The Davidic kings were shadows of the royal nature of Jesus and therefore they were supposed to be the loving bridegrooms of Israel (2 Samuel 5:1).  But, like an abusive bridegroom, Rehoboam refused to listen to the people's pains and oppressed his bride (Israel) more than before, and thus forced the 10 tribes of Israel to divorce him (separate themselves from him).

1 Kings 12:26-33
After the death of King Solomon, God left His people and thereafter the kingdom of Israel was split into two.  King Jeroboam ruled the northern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 10 tribes, whereas Solomon’s son King Rehoboam ruled the southern kingdom of Israel which was made up of 2 tribes.

Jeroboam was worried that if the people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple, as desired by God, then they may once again turn towards Rehoboam.  He was also afraid that the people may kill him to return to Rehoboam.  So he made two golden calves and he asked the people to worship the golden calves.  He built shrines in the northern kingdom as a cultic move against the Jerusalem Temple.  It was done to increase the economic structure of the northern kingdom by stopping the people from going to Jerusalem for the annual festivals (Passover, etc.).  Jeroboam also ordained non-Levitcal men as priests, which was not acceptable to God (1 Kings 13:33-34) because it was not the Mosaic ordination.

Jeroboam was earlier working under Solomon as the manager of forced labor.  God elevated Jeroboam from a king’s servant to be a king himself (1 Kings 11:26-39) and gave him a chance to lead the people and bring them closer to God, but Jeroboam, in his greed, took the people away from God.
Thus Jeroboam displeased the Lord.

If God has blessed us with a supervisory or leadership role, let us ensure that we please God in everything we say and do.  Let us also ensure that we guide our subordinates to do the same, whether we are parents, teachers, ministers, pastors, managers, directors, etc.

### Faith Over Success

[![Faith Over Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day163.jpg)](https://youtu.be/neNNncU0fy8 "Faith Over Success")

### Day #163 In love with God

Many people complain that religion is boring, and praying is more like a chore. This is a genuine experience for those who are not experiencing a love relationship with the Lord. Our God is not a distant God who gave us the 10 commandments and said – “Ok now follow them or else you’re going to hell”.
The Song of Solomon/Songs gives us a poetic picture of how God loves us and pursues us. He is like a lover seeking out his love and calling her and seeking after her. It’s compared to nature in springtime, how the dove seeks out its mate. The male birds are more beautiful than the female and they sport colorful feathers, dance, and make sounds to impress the females. The dove finds a mate and becomes a bonded pair – raising chicks and only focused on their lives. In the same way, our lover Jesus goes after the lost sheep and seeks it out, once He finds it will dust off the dirt and carry it back on his shoulders.
Our God is not distant but is always with us, even until the end of the age. He knows everything about us when we sit down when we rise up when we come and go out.
Even before a word is on our lips, he already knows it. He cares for us and comforts us when we are in distress.
We are called to love him back and seek after Him with all our heart, mind, and soul. Our prayers and practices should be works of passion and with great love for the Lord.
“let me see your face, let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.” SOS 2:14
We need to seek Jesus' face, more than his hands. We need to bring prayers of praise and worship before we pray prayers of petition. Let us seek Jesus' beautiful face in the Eucharist as we receive it and fall deeply in love with him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### DAY 163: By Sheila

In the Book of Kings, the Prophet who spoke to Kings, went to the pagan altar where King Jeroboam led in worship of false gods. He prophesied that a King from the lineage of David would come to cleanse the altar of its pagan sacrifices. This prophecy was fulfilled by King Josiah nearly three Centuries later.
In Chronicles, Rehoboam forsook the Law of the Lord and suffered defeat and lost the cities he had built. It was the end of Rehoboam's Reign.
Abijah became King, he cried out to the Lord. His faithfulness to the Lord, got him victory. The Mother of Abijah was the beloved wife if King Rehoboam. She was the daughter of Tamar, grand-daughter of Absalom and she worshipped idols.
The Covenant of Salt describes the effective and permanent Character of God's Covenant with David because salt is used as a preservative and enhance flavor.
In the Song if Songs, God's love is manifested. He is calling, pursuers us, cares and comforts all.
Nothing can seperate us from God's Love. Foxes that spoil the vines is a reference found in any intimate relationship. A marriage is a commitment to work through such difficulties and protect relationship.

### Tearing Down Idols

[![Tearing Down Idols](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day164.jpg)](https://youtu.be/enUrFPRHmMc "Tearing Down Idols")

### Day #164 People turn to God when everything else fails.

At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one who told me I would be king over this people.
Why would he ask his wife to disguise herself, one reason would be because King Jeroboam was not in good standing with the prophets or God. He is the King in the North that built idols and ordained fake priests just so that people would not go to the south to worship in Jerusalem.
But when it came to his own son Abijah he wanted to somehow have the Lord heal him. He tried a crooked way to get God’s blessing, it didn’t work. Remember last time the prophet was torn apart by the Lion because he ate with this King.
One cannot dodge God, God is all-knowing.
This is the case with many of the people in the world today. They want to live as they want and indulge in worldly pleasure and comforts. When they get sick or have problems, they turn to medicine, counseling, meditation, and therapy(not that any of those are wrong - they should be treated as instruments the Lord uses to heal us - these become a problem when they become an end in its own).
When everything else fails they want the Lord to heal them, they would come in disguise only with the intention to be healed, visit every prayer center, and holy place, ask everyone to pray and once they receive the healing they are back in the world. We see the bad fate of Jeroboam, his wife, and the sick son even dies.
Let us not be like Jeroboam, but seek the Lord earnestly with all our hearts, minds, and body. We should always pray and have a relationship with God, in good and bad times. We should not be part-time servers, but lifelong disciples of the Lord, who follow Him as he leads us.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Lover and the Beloved

### Day #165 “My sister, my bride”

These words from the book of Song of Solomon may seem odd
A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed. SOS 4:12
The Bridegroom is referring to the bride as my sister, my bride which can be seen as weird. However, the deeper meaning can be understood by the Greek definition of the word love. Greek words for love are Agape, Eros, Philia, and Storge.
Agape is the unconditional love of God for His children.
Eros means romantic or intimate love.
Philia is affectionate friendship
Storge is affectionate love for children or parents.
In a good marriage, it is important to have Philia love as Eros will not last a lifetime. A couple should have an affectionate friendship(Philia) so they can spend a good life together. The phrase “I married my best friend” is well-fitting in this context. If there is a lack of friendship between a husband and wife, married life becomes a drag. Philia love lasts a lifetime and grows as the years go by. However Eros love on its own can seem to diminish over the years, but if the Philla love is kept active, Eros love grows as well.
Eros love separated from Philla can becomes selfish and affect the marriage in a negative way. The Bridegroom is not supposed to take his wife for granted, as described in SOS -she is a "locked garden". One should approach Eros love as a request and in openness, seeking and not demanding. Just like in the next chapter we read “My beloved is knocking” – one is called to be a gentleman/woman – approach Eros love as though it’s a gift.
Jesus our bridegroom – approaches us with the same gentleness. Jesus does not push and force His way into our lives. In the Book of Revelation, we read about Him knocking at the door of our hearts.
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. Rev 3:20
Jesus could have easily said – “I am your creator, better listen to me” or “I died for you, stop sinning and let me eat dinner” or “where is the fruit? May this tree be destroyed” But he didn't.
Jesus approaches us with gentleness, “Here I am” “I stand” “I knock” – “if anyone hears my voice” “if you open the door” – just picture this the savior of the world, standing and knocking – waiting for our response. Let us not delay in opening our hearts, to welcome the Love of lives Jesus into every aspect of our lives into the Philla and Eros of our marriages. It takes 3 to get married – husband, wife, and God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Responding in Faith

[![Responding in Faith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day166.jpg)](https://youtu.be/dAahyYCBKXM "Responding in Faith")

## Day #166 Was prophet Elijah mean to the Widow

We read the story of Elijah‘s visit to the widow at Zarephath, God asked the prophet to visit the widow as she would feed him in the drought. Now remember its severe drought and widows in the ancient Jewish society were the poorest as they had very less means of income. This poor widow was collecting sticks to possible cook her last meal, she and her son were going to eat this last meal and die of starvation after that.
Now we see Elijah almost being insensitive to her when he asks for water and a meal. He said bring me water, and while she was going to fetch it – he said bring me a meal. It appears as though God brough Elijah all the way to Zarephath just to be mean to this poor widow.
Not so, when she shared her difficulties – Elijah said to her,
“Do not be afraid; go and do as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterwards make something for yourself and your son. 14 For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.” 1 Kings 14:13
This widow heard God’s word and acted on it, she did as the prophet told her and her household had food for many days the jug of oil did not fail nor was the meal emptied.
Elijah initially seemed mean but he wasn’t, he was just trying to test the widow and help her build up her faith. God is kind and loving and sometimes tests our faith not to insult us or to trouble us – but to help our faith grow so we can receive the Miracle.
Don’t we even recall Jesus doing such a thing in the incident with the Canaanite woman.
The Canaanites were gentiles and when she followed Jesus asking for the deliverance of her daughter – Jesus seems to be mean when he said “It’s not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” She said yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table. Jesus answered “O woman, great is your faith. Be it done for you as you desire” and her daughter was healed immediately. Here we see that Jesus kinda lead the women to have deeper stronger faith, his initial words seems mean but it made her stronger and built her faith.
So the next time we feel that we do not get what we want and are being pushed to the limit, let us remember that there is a Miracle waiting on the other side of our trials. Have faith!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 166 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 17:10-16
By being more concerned about his hunger and not caring about the widow’s problem, Elijah sounds like a selfish man.  But Elijah was testing the widow’s faith in God.  The widow, who was not even a Jew, trusted in the word of Elijah, a man of God, and the promise of his Lord.  Facing sure starvation, she gave all that she had, her last bit of food, feeding the man of God before herself and her family.

The poor widow was not successful in her material life, yet she gave all that she had, unselfishly, even though she was left empty handed and not sure when her next meal was going to come.  She willingly gave because she wanted to please God, even if it meant that she would have to starve.

The widow was a shadow of Mary (the widowed mother of Jesus).  Mary too was not successful in her material life, yet she took care of the Son of God and unselfishly gave up her only Son because she wanted to please God.

The poor widow willingly gave her tithe to the man of God, in the form of food, and God multiplied the flour and oil so that the jar of flour was never empty and the jug of oil never ran dry.

The flour was a shadow of the Eucharist (of which it is an ingredient) and the oil was a shadow of the priesthood (priests are anointed with oil).

If we are generous in giving our tithes to the Church to support the men of God (the priests) then God will bless us abundantly (2 Corinthians 9:6-8) and our parish will always have sufficient priests to provide us with the Bread of life (Eucharist) as long as we live.

1 Kings 18:41-46
King Ahab and his wife Jezebel had killed all the Lord’s prophets and they also wanted Elijah dead (1 Kings 19:10).  Ahab had even sent his man Obadiah to search for Elijah all over Israel and in all the neighboring nations (1 Kings 18:10), and yet Elijah shared the Word of God with the same Ahab, and prayed to God to give them rain, inspite of facing persecution, opposition, slander and subversion from the same King Ahab.

Elijah did not take revenge on Ahab and Jezebel.  He knew that he had to forgive his offenders if he wanted God to forgive him his sins.  Elijah was a man of God, a mediator between God and man, and by forgiving his offenders, inspite of what they had done to him, he set a great example for his congregation.

Like Elijah, let us always remember to forgive our offenders irrespective of how much they have hurt us.  Let us not think of retaliating or taking revenge in any way.

"Forgive us Lord, as we forgive those who sin against us" (Matthew 6:12).

### BIAY Day 167 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 19:1-8
Elijah was re-living the experiences of Moses and his people in the old Covenant, as a shadow to be fulfilled by Christ and his people in the new Covenant.

1.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah saved himself from the cruel queen and took refuge at Mount Horeb/Sinai, the mountain of God, just as Moses saved his people from the cruel king and took refuge at Mount Sinai/Horeb, the mountain of God.

1.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus saved us from Satan and gave us refuge in the Temple of God (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) which He offered up to God on Mount Zion.

2.a) In the old Covenant, Elijah and Moses spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

2.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus spent 40 days of fasting in the desert.

3.a) In the old Covenant, God fed Elijah in the desert with miraculous bread & water to strengthen him on his physical journey just as God fed Moses & his people in the desert with miraculous bread (Manna) & water to strengthen them on their physical journey.

3.b) In the new Covenant, Jesus gives us the miraculous water of Baptism and feeds us with the miraculous Bread of life (His Body / the Holy Eucharist) to strengthen us on our spiritual journey.

1 Kings 19:11-13
God did not speak to Elijah when there was noise and chaos around.  God spoke to him only when there was silence.  The strong wind, earthquake and fire were only to announce the arrival of an important person just as we use bugles, trumpets and drums for the same reason.

God does not speak to us when our lives are filled with noise and chaos.  That is why it is important to sit alone in silence, for a few moments every day, and speak to the Lord so that we can build a personal relationship with Him, just as we build a personal relationship with our family and friends by talking to them.

Let us therefore try to avoid filling our lives with secular music and too much carousing.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day #167 The sound of sheer silence

We read about the 'God encounter' of Elijah on the mountain. The angel told Elijah to stand on the mountain and wait for the Lord.
Now there was a great wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; 12 and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of sheer silence. 13 When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then there came a voice to him that said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” 1 Kings 17:11-13
Elijah would have anticipated that the Might God, creator of the world would come with great splendor, with thunder, fire, smoke, and lightning. He looked for God in the wind, the earthquake, the fire, but when he heard the sound of sheer silence, he wrapped his face and went out of the cave and stood at the entrance, then there was a voice that spoke to him.
It's the same with us, our lives are so full of noise and busy schedules that we are unable to calm down to hear God’s voice. We seem to be preoccupied with so many things, planning for the future and sometimes dwelling too much on the past, that we do not create space for the Lord to speak to us. We are running from pillar to post and don’t have time for the Lord. We need to allocate quiet time with the Lord, where we can have a heart-to-heart conversation with Jesus. Let’s put Jesus on our schedule, maybe an hour of adoration once a week. Don’t get me wrong, we can hear God talk to us anytime, however it is clearer when we quiet our hearts and pay full attention. When Elijah heard the sound of silence – it was his "Theophany" moment when he realizes that he was in the presence of God Almighty. The “sound of silence” is one of those sounds where you know that it’s an out-of-this-world experience, you just know – it’s hard to explain what the presence of the Lord feels like.
The Psalmist invites us to “this still” state.
He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; Ps 46:10
Jesus constantly took his disciples away from the crowd to a quiet place
Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, “Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.” Mark 6:31
Jesus himself went away from the crowds and the disciples to pray. Jesus would send the disciples away and have personal time with Abba Father and usually woke up before everyone to pray.
And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed. (Mark 1:35)
Let us also make this a habit, let us have a quiet time and space to pray. A time for some sacred silence and meditation. Let us follow Jesus's instruction to go inside your room and pray.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
Once we heard the voice of God, we will always be able to tune ourselves to the small still voice that tells us right from wrong. Many of us already know that still small voice that comes from within, telling us right from wrong.
This song really helps me when I try to enter into that sacred place with the Lord.
May the Holy Spirt lead us 🙏

### Wicked Kings

### BIAY Day 168 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 21:1-29
Buying and selling of property in Israel was not allowed because the land which the people had received was a gift from God, and yet, King Ahab wanted to buy Naboth’s vineyard.  Naboth however refused to sell it because he was a righteous man, who faithfully followed the laws of God.  Therefore Ahab, upon advice from his wife, arranged for Naboth to be stoned to death.

In this passage we see injustice done to Naboth but the culprit (Ahab) was spared because he repented.

Why does God allow the innocent ones to die cruel deaths at the hands of wicked people?
This has been a very common question since thousands of years.
But before we start being judgemental about God’s justice, we must first ask ourselves, “whose sins caused Jesus, the innocent and sinless son of God, to be scourged and crucified?”

In a covenantal relation it is always the innocent ones who have to pay the price for the sins of the wicked ones, because the death of an innocent person brings about a transformation in the life of a wicked person, as in the case of Ahab.  God may not always send official prophets and priests to transform the wicked, like He did with Ahab.  He may just stir up their conscience to bring about the change.
God’s grace flows when an innocent man dies in peace at the hands of the wicked (as in the case of Naboth) or when the innocent man forgives his offenders before dying (as in the case of Stephen / Acts 7:59-60).

If we are baptized in Christ, then we must be prepared to suffer and die like Christ to bring about a change in someone, and God may use us to bring about that change.
God’s justice against the wicked will be satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous.  If God is just, He is also merciful.  God in His justice said the price for our sins has to be paid, but God in His mercy said He would pay the price because each one of us is precious to Him.

God’s Kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36). When we are baptized we become missionaries and soldiers of Christ.  We are sent into this world for a short period of time, to carry out our mission and return back to our kingdom.  Our duty is to stand on the spiritual battlefield every day of our lives and fight the evil forces, represented by humans, while we carry out God’s mission on earth, whatever we may have been called to do for the growth of God’s Kingdom

As soldiers of Christ we must always remember that a battlefield is not a comfort zone.  Therefore we must be prepared to face attacks from the evil ones.  It may be in the form of insults, humiliation, criticism, rejection, false accusations, injustice, any kind of suffering or even giving up our lives, etc., but, like Naboth, we must always be obedient to God’s commandments to the end.

When Satan comes with his deceptive offers of comfort and pleasure and twists our minds, we often tend to forget our true mission and we start building our nests on earth, and then, when we face negative situations, we are clueless about why things are happening the way they are and how to respond according to God’s Will.

We therefore need to start questioning ourselves:

Have we started the mission which we were sent here for?
Are we even aware of what our mission is?
Did we ask God to help us find our mission?

In this passage, Naboth was a shadow of Jesus, and Ahab was a shadow of us sinners.  Naboth was also a shadow of the innocent people of God who die at the hands of the wicked, and Ahab was a shadow of the wicked people.
God allows this to happen so that one or more lost souls can be brought into His kingdom.
If we look at Naboth’s case from the worldly point of view, we see injustice done to him.  But if we look at his case from God’s point of view, then we see God’s victory through Naboth (1 Kings 21:29).

We will all die according to the expiry date which God has set for us.  It is not important for us to focus on living a long life and, however much we try we cannot increase our life span even if we go to the gym every day and eat healthy food.
What is more important is whether we have been successful in bringing souls to the Kingdom of God during our lifetime, not by force but by doing God’s Will.  And if our death can bring at least one soul to God, then our life is worth living (James 5:20).

### Day #169 Protecting the children – they are the future

When Athaliah was about to murder all the heirs of the Kingdom of Judah, Jehosheba the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered. Once Athaliah was slain, they made the 7-year-old kid Joash King. There is an important lesson to learn from Jehosheba who helped save an heir to the throne and those elders who guided the young King to rule.
There are other times in the Bible where the infants have been hidden away, like Moses in the basket on the Nile(and in Pharoah's palace) and even baby Jesus was taken by Joseph and Mary to Egypt.
The lesson to learn is we need to protect the children, from all harm. We need to help shape their minds and build up their faith, make them capable of leading a nation.
Make them leaders of the nations, holy leaders who will stand up for what is holy and true.
Even Jesus in his public ministry uplifted the children, in a time when children had little value.
People were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them; and when the disciples saw it, they sternly ordered them not to do it. But Jesus called for them and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. Luke 18:15,16
Also Jesus warns us about leading the children into sin.
If any of you put a stumbling block before one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for you if a great millstone were fastened around your neck and you were drowned in the depth of the sea. Mat 18:6
We live in a generation that has committed great sins against children. We have seen so many pedophile cases and so many kids have been abused even before they reach the age of reason. In many cases the adults who are supposed to care for them, end up abusing them. It's shocking to know that parents, guardians, clergy, teachers, grandparents, scout leaders, coaches, and the list goes on, have actually abused little kids which have impacted the kids for life.
Feel so grateful for those good teachers, parents, grandparents, coaches, clergy, and youth ministers….who sacrifice their lives to care for the young, they help build up the next generation. For there are far more good people than bad.
Let us be guardians to the kids in our world today, and be role models through our life examples.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
