### The Decline of Solomon

[![The Decline of Solomon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day153.jpg)](https://youtu.be/P16j_E54TVU "The Decline of Solomon")

### Day #153 Choosing the right life partner

We see that the wisest man ever, King Solomon has been fooled. He who started off well, listening to God‚Äôs voice and building the great temple and praying for the right things ‚Äì for ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù. He knew the wise thing to do and experienced the Lord speaking to him several times in his life, yet he was fooled and mislead by his wives. He had too many of them, 700 wives and 300 concubines. They lead him astray to worship their gods.
Solomon loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh‚Äôs daughter‚ÄîMoabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. They were from nations about which the Lord had told the Israelites, ‚ÄúYou must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.‚Äù
As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been. 1 King 11
Solomon the wisest person should have known that these gods of his wives were simply evil as their worship included child sacrifice and many other evil practices. Also, Solomon was going against the commands of the Lord to not marry women from those places.
The Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord‚Äôs command. 1 Kings 11:9-10
It is a terrible ending that we read about, the wisest man ever has been fooled. His heart is closed to the Lord‚Äôs warnings and at the lowest point of his life.
It is not just wisdom that we need but the will to do the right thing as well.
Like Solomon, we can mess up our lives if we marry the wrong person. We need to be very discerning and careful about the spouse we pick. Marry someone who loves the Lord and is rooted and grounded in the Lord. Go through a discernment process to see if it‚Äôs the Lord‚Äôs plan for the two of you.
Who can find a worthy wife? She is far more precious than pearls.
Her husband entrusts his heart to her, for in her he has an unfailing blessing. Prov 31:10-11
Some very good advice to wives and applies to husbands as well.
Wives, in the same way, accept the authority of your husbands, so that, even if some of them do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by their wives‚Äô conduct, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. Do not adorn yourselves outwardly by braiding your hair, and by wearing gold ornaments or fine clothing; rather, let your adornment be the inner self with the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God‚Äôs sight. 1 Pet 3:1-5
So when you look for your spouse don‚Äôt only look for looks or jewelry or clothing. Look at how they conduct themselves, look for a genuine spirit and a gentle spirit that loves the Lord. Remember that the Lord has someone in store for you, seek His will.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 153 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 11:1-13
Marriages were designed by God for a God-centered couple (1 man & 1 woman) to raise a family with love.  The purpose of the marriage was never supposed to be for personal gain.  It is a life-time covenantal relationship.  When God or love or couple are missing in the marriage, or the purpose is ungodly, then blessings don‚Äôt pour in.

Solomon started off very well with God-centeredness, couple marriage and love.  In his earlier years Solomon may have loved every single of his wife and he may have been worshipping the living God to keep Him happy, but unfortunately, Solomon‚Äôs purpose for the marriage was not love; it was to gain political alliances (1 Kings 3:1).  He did not maintain the covenantal oath of a marriage to be faithful to one spouse, and in his latter years he even stopped being God-centered.  Just as he multiplied his wives, he also multiplied his gods.

God had patience with Solomon and spared him for the sake of his father, King David, but his descendants had to bear the consequences of his sins (Exodus 20:3-5) and therefore, after the death of Solomon, the kingdom of Israel was torn apart because God left them, and Rehoboam turned out to be worse than his father Solomon.

Let us make sure we don‚Äôt follow the errors of Solomon in our married lives or else our children may have to bear the consequences of our sins.

The three restrictions given in the Mosaic Law for the future kings was that they must not multiply their Wealth, Weapons and Wives (Deut. 17:14).
But Solomon broke all three articles of the Law by multiplying his Wealth (1 Kings 10:14), Weapons (1 Kings 10:26) and Wives (1 Kings 11:3).
Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue (1 Kings 10:28) and married pagan women from the neighboring pagan countries which God had forbidden them from marrying.  The pagan wives later turned Solomon‚Äôs heart away from God by making him worship their false gods.  Solomon loved his wives and therefore in order to please them He displeased the Lord.

*When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other false gods, and his heart was not true to the Lord his God.*

In the Garden of Eden, Eve shared the forbidden fruit with Adam, for a false god, and turned his heart away from the Lord his God.

### The Baptism of Jesus

[![The Baptism of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day154.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9xPADpXjRUY "The Baptism of Jesus")

### Day #154 Holy Trinity

As we begin our Messianic Checkpoint with St Mark‚Äôs Gospel. It seems that it‚Äôs a rapid-fire Gospel, as it is the shortest and has fast-moving scenes. Although we can spend years contemplating the mysteries revealed, Mark keeps us moving along with the style of his writing and the repeated use of the word ‚ÄúImmediately‚Äù
The opening scene is John the Baptist preaching a message of repentance and people were getting baptized in the River Jordan. Immediately the focus shifts to Jesus, Jesus is revealed following the words ‚ÄúI have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit‚Äù
Just in the blink of an eye, we see Jesus being baptized. Rather than run with the speed of Mark let us stay here and absorb it all.
First of all, why did Jesus need to be baptized if He is God, did the water purify Him? No he was baptized just to show us the way, His baptism revealed his identity as the Son of God and He did not need to be purified but when he touched the water the waters were made Holy, just as when the unclean leaper(/the women with the flow of blood) touched Him he was not made unclean but they were made clean and whole.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.‚Äù Mark 1: 9
Given that St Marks' Gospel was the very first account of the Gospel, we are reading for the very first time the obvious revelation of the Holy Trinity. We are introduced to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit in the same scene. All three are divine, and all three are one God. One God ‚Äì three persons.
First of all, this is a mystery and we cannot ever fully understand a mystery. What we need to do is enter into the mystery and experience it, we cannot solve it.
It‚Äôs not a math problem, we cannot say that this math equation ‚Äú1X1X1 = 1‚Äù solves the Trinity equation.
It‚Äôs more of a who God is a thing. We have a Triune God. Father-Son-Spirit who are equal in all aspects and divine in all aspects, totally united and one.
Jesus is not created by the Father, they are of the same substance so to speak, and hence begotten, Jesus is not made, Jesus is not one of the creations that were created in the beginning when the Spirit of God hovered over the void world. There were all present even before creation, for at creation we see the conversation - "Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness" and the Holy Spirit hover over the void.
When it comes to the Holy Trinity the best way to understand it is to enter into it. Enter into the mystery and discover it. To fall in love with God, the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.
The Trinity is a mystery of faith in the strict sense, one of the ‚Äúmysteries that are hidden in God, which can never be known unless they are revealed by God.‚Äù To be sure, God has left traces of his Trinitarian being in his work of creation and in his Revelation throughout the Old Testament. But his inmost Being as Holy Trinity is a mystery that is inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel‚Äôs faith before the Incarnation of God‚Äôs Son and the sending of the Holy Spirit. (CCC 237)
The mystery of the Holy Trinity could be one thing that Jesus said to the disciples ‚ÄúI have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now‚Ä¶‚Äù and promised the Holy Spirit ‚Äúhe will guide you into all the truth‚Äù (16:13). The Church was guided to understand God as Triune.
Let us ask the Holy Spirit to lead us into the mystery of the Holy Trinity ‚Äì Father, Son, and Spirit. So we could be one with God - just as the Father, Son, and Spirit are one.
May the Holy Spirit lead usüôè

### DAY 154 By Sheila

Today's Study on John the Baptist centered on two messages: The repentance of sins and the Person of Jesus Christ.

At the Baptism of Jesus, The Presence of the Trinity is emphasized. Jesus The Son Of Flesh, The Holy Spirit in the form of a Dove and The Father whose voice was heard from Heaven.

Jesus' miracles primarily called attention to the Offering of the Kingdom. More and more people began to follow.

Jesus knew their thoughts, He forgave their sins and physically healed them. Jesus claimed clear, He does the work only God can do. Therefore, He is God.

Matthew was a tax-collector for Herod Antipas. He received the same invitation as Peter, Andrew, James, John and like the others, who followed Jesus immediately.

In the Psalm, the Psalmist found refuge in the Lord whom he trusted. God loves those who practice righteousness and who make right choices and display right attitudes in life.

### BIAY Day 154 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 1:2-3

\*As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, ‚ÄúSee, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.‚Äù\*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God had promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father so that the new Israel (Jesus) could lead them in their new exodus toward the promised land (Malachi 3:1).

\*‚ÄúPrepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.‚Äù\*

To prepare the way, for the Lord to enter their hearts, the people had to begin with repentance.

God had already prepared the way (a sinless womb) for the arrival of His Son into the world and Mary maintained the sanctity of her womb by ensuring that she always stayed out of sin so she received the Body of Christ into her body in a state of grace.

Like Mary, we too must do our best to remain out of sin at all times so that we can always receive the Body of Christ (Communion) into our bodies in a state of grace.

Mark 1:12‚Äì15
\*The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan;\*
God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

Mark 1:35
\*In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed.\*

This was *God praying to God* in the early hours of the morning.

By waking up before dawn, going to an isolated place and spending time with God the Father, Jesus gave us a template for prayer.  Jesus gave more importance to His time with God and adjusted His daily schedule in the rest of the time.

Inspite of His busy schedule Jesus always made it a point to spend time with God in solitude.  He expects us to do the same.  However busy we are with our earthly duties and commitments, we must spend sufficient time with God every day.

If Jesus humbled Himself to this level then we cannot make excuses to pray every morning.  We must keep our mornings free for God and fit our daily schedule in the rest of the time.  Our priority must be given to our time with God and not to our daily schedule.

Morning is the best time to pray so that we can start the day with the Lord, and Jesus is the best example (Psalm 90:14; 143:8-10). We can choose to be with the Lord in many ways like going to Church for the morning service or sitting alone in silence and speaking to the Lord, or getting together with family and praying, etc.

### Jesus is Lord

[![Jesus is Lord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day155.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RLBBThbC7gw "Jesus is Lord")

### Day #155 Why did Jesus use Parables?

We see that Jesus used a lot of parables in his teaching and the disciples wanted to know why. They found it hard to follow and understand, they even had to ask Jesus to explain to them. They wondered why he spoke in parables and so they asked Him.
The disciples came to him and asked, ‚ÄúWhy do you speak to the people in parables?‚Äù
Jesus‚Äô answer may shock you, let's read it.
‚ÄúTo you has been given the secret(mysteries) of the kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything comes in parables; in order that
‚Äòthey may indeed look, but not perceive, and may indeed listen, but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be forgiven.‚Äô‚Äù
So does Jesus not want people to repent, nope that is not the point. He wants them to, He even died for them. Jesus is only quoting Isiah ‚Äì when the Israelites were very corrupt and hard-hearted. Their hearts had grown hardened and their ears dull. Even though God wants to forgive them, they did not want God‚Äôs forgiveness and friendship. Just like when they condemned Jesus for healing on the sabbath, Jesus replied with a genuine response
‚ÄúThen he said to them, ‚ÄúIs it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to kill?‚Äù But they were silent.‚Äù He looked around at them with anger; he was grieved at their hardness of heart
Even though Jesus gave them a correct answer they did not accept it, they were silent. Jesus looked at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart. It‚Äôs due to their limitation that they cannot understand the parable.
The parables both conceal and reveal at the same time. The parables conceal the secrets of kingdoms from those whose hearts are closed to God and it reveals the secrets of the Kingdom to those who have an opened mind and heart. Jesus says many times ‚ÄúWhoever has ears, let them hear ‚Äù. It‚Äôs not about being really smart to understand them but about being open instead, for the Spirit will reveal the secrets to us.
Parables are drawn from the everyday life of the 1st century Jews. The parables are meant to get us thinking, and it's not something that needs to be taken literally. It‚Äôs meant to help us understand something higher than what the stories are about. The parables have a twist and are like a puzzle or a riddle and they need to be solved and they should get us thinking, the problem with most of us is we have read them many times over and don‚Äôt really want to explore them like a mystery.
Rather than just telling people bluntly that they are wrong, Jesus gives them a parable so that they can think about the parable and come to know their own mistakes and repent.
Jesus wants everyone to be saved, He is that careless Sower who just keeps throwing seeds everywhere on the rocks, pathways, in the thorn bushes, and on good soil. This should actually surprise you as ‚Äì no good farmer will ever sow in these places ‚Äì this is the kind of twist we need to look for in the parables.
We need to apply the parable to our lives, in the parable of the sower we can compare our hearts to the soil. We need hearts that are willing to listen to God‚Äôs word, we need to nurture the word of God and let it shape us and bear fruit for the world. We should not have a heart of stone where the seed sprouts but dies soon, or be overly concerned about the worldly things that our faith gets chocked. We should not let the devil and the world steal God‚Äôs words from our hearts, we should be good soil.
Let‚Äôs try to read each parable and explore it, the parable reveals secrets/mysteries, let us explore and enjoy them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 155 By Cynthia Dsilva

Mark 3:14
*And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles.*

When Jesus chose Judas to be one of His apostles, he was well aware that Judas was a thief.  Inspite of this, Jesus kept Judas in charge of the money collection bag.  Jesus gave Judas the opportunity to change himself and take care of the money bag honestly; but since Judas never had any intention to change himself, he chose to constantly steal money from the bag.

A man does not become a priest by his own wish but only when called by God (Hebrews 5:4).  Therefore, Jesus chose Judas because it was God‚Äôs Will.  So along with the good ones, God calls the ungodly ones also.  God allows problems in the lives of the priests so that the good ones can go through spiritual healing and the holy ones can be glorified.  In the meanwhile, the ungodly ones have a chance to mix with the good ones and transform themselves.

Satan used Judas to destroy God‚Äôs plan for redemption, but God transformed that evil into good by giving us redemption through the Blood of Christ, according to His plan, exactly as it was prophesied, and thus Jesus (the holy one) was glorified.

A smooth and comfortable life does not prove that a priest or his congregation are worthy to enter the gates of heaven.  We must be tested for trust, obedience to God and righteousness, and God allows Satan to create obstacles in our path.

On the spiritual battle field, the priests are the ones in the front.  Priests are human like us and they are bound to fall into temptation to work for the enemy, and therefore they need our spiritual support (prayers).  Our duty as Christians is to handle the negative situation using God‚Äôs weapons (peace, unity, prayer, fasting, etc.).

Jesus showed us that even though all the Judases may betray Him by committing mortal sins, the Church (the mystical Body of Christ / the saints) will reach the promised land (Heaven), just as the physical Body of Christ did.  We, the beloved disciples, are called to stand with the Church (the Body of Christ), through good times and bad times, to the end (John 19:26).

When we commit a mortal sin, we stand in the place of Judas who handed over Jesus to the enemy to be scourged and crucified.  Let us therefore ensure to keep our souls purified at all times.

The 12 Apostles didn't have much in common.
Matthew, the tax collector, was working for Rome, whereas Simon, the zealot, was bent on eliminating Rome.   Judas was a thief, and some were fishermen. But surprisingly they were all united in Christ. Whatever their backgrounds they never fought with each other.

Mark 3:27
Jesus came to this area to bind the strong man (Satan) and take back what belonged to God (the man who was possessed by demons).

In the old Covenant, Jesus exorcized the demons from the people by His physical presence .
In the new Covenant, Jesus exorcizes the demons from our souls spiritually through the sacraments.

Mark 3:33-35
*But he said to them in reply, ‚ÄúWho are my mother and my brothers?‚Äù  And looking around at those seated in the circle he said, ‚ÄúHere are my mother and my brothers. Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.‚Äù*

Jesus was upgrading all His disciples who believe in Him and obey the Will of God, of whom His Mother was the first and best example.
The greatness of Mary was not in the fact that her womb was chosen to carry the promised Messiah, but in the fact that she heard the Word of God and obeyed it without asking for any perks.

Jesus asked the question and answered it Himself, thus making it known to all His disciples (present & future), that His mother perfectly fulfilled the role of being His  Mother by her obedience and complete surrender to the Will of God.  The Mother of Jesus is the first Christian who accepted Jesus even before He was born.  By His question and answer, Jesus was also exalting His mother.

### Jesus Casts Out Demons

[![Jesus Casts Out Demons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/June/jpgs/Day156.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gWWwt7YOYOk "Jesus Casts Out Demons")

### Day #156 "Prayer of faith brings healing" , ‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù

We read this moving story of Jairus and his daughter. The scene opens with a desperate father - Jairus who fell at Jesus' feet begging for the healing of his daughter. While Jesus was on the way to go heal the girl, there was a big crowd around Jesus ‚Äì many people were touching and pushing Jesus. However, one woman had been suffering from the flow of blood for many years and had spent all that she had but suffered at the hands of the physicians instead of getting healed. According to the customs, she should not touch anyone if not they would become unclean, however, her faith went beyond her reason and she reached out and touched Jesus‚Äô cloak, and immediately after she got healed of her hemorrhage. Jesus stopped and said ‚ÄúWho touched me?‚Äù for power went out of Him.
Even though there were many people who were pushing Jesus and touching Him, only the one who touched Him in faith received the healing. Even today when we pray, we sometimes do not have faith, we are just listing out our problems without believing that Jesus can heal us or provide for us -those prayers without faith are just like the crowd that was pushing Jesus, like the crowd that only followed Jesus because their belly was filled with the feeding of the multitude. We ought to make prayers of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù believing in our hearts that Jesus will answer them, these prayers of faith touch Jesus.
Never lose hope even if the situation gets worse like that of Jairus, whose daughter died while Jesus was on the way. Jesus encouraged Jairus and said, ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe‚Äù. Jesus entered the house, cleared the place of those mourning, and brought the girl back to life.
So be it with our life, even if it seems that God is not answering our prayers of faith do not give us. Jesus encourages us as he encouraged Jairus ‚ÄúDo not fear, only believe‚Äù. Let us not be afraid of anything, even if it seems that all is lost, just trust in Him and have faith. Because Jesus is walking towards us, He is coming to take care of us. ‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù
Every time we are afraid just say these words Jesus taught Jairus.
‚ÄúDo not fear just believe.‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 156 By Cynthia Dsilva\_

Mark 5:4
\*For he had often been restrained with shackles and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the shackles he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.\*

Inspite of being tied with shackles and chains the man was able to break himself free.

Sometimes we think we are smarter than the evil one and we can fool him easily but we have to remember that the evil one is the most intelligent creature of God‚Äôs creation.  More often, than not, with his modern ideologies the evil one makes us walk on his path willingly, with no resistance from us at all. Without the presence of God in our lives we can be easily deceived into thinking that we are walking on the right path.  Whatever we do to get rid of the devil, he will always find a new way to trick us.  But God will be present in our lives only if we receive the sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist, regularly, and keep our souls purified at all times.

Mark 5:18-20
\*As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.  But Jesus refused, and said to him, ‚ÄúGo home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy he has shown you.‚Äù\*
\*And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed.\*

The man wanted to be a disciple of Jesus but Jesus made him a missionary.  After the demons were cast out of the man, and without any experience, he did such a great job of making Jesus known to the people that when Jesus came to that same place the second time there was a huge crowd of gentiles waiting to hear Him preach.

If we keep ourselves purified at all times the Lord will bless us and help us to be little missionaries like that man. We don't need to be scholars or experienced people to do God's work.

Mark 5:21-43
Jairus‚Äôs daughter was twelve years old, while the woman had been suffering from haemorrhage for the same length of time (12 years).

At the same moment when Jesus said to the woman, ‚ÄúDaughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace‚Äù Jairus got news from his home that his daughter had died.  When one daughter was healed, the other one died.

Jairus may have been a synagogue official in that same area where the woman lived.
This is the one and only time Jesus addresses a woman as ‚Äúdaughter.‚Äù

Why here? And why now?

Probably, in order to call Jairus‚Äôs attention to the fact that he was not the only person there who had a daughter in need of healing.

Twelve years earlier, this woman began to hemorrhage. As a result, the woman would certainly have been excluded from participating in the worship at the synagogue where Jairus was an official, because she was ritually unclean. It is likely that it was Jairus himself who excluded her from the worship at the synagogue, since he was the ruler there. For twelve years this woman was excluded from the house of her heavenly Father, while for twelve years Jairus enjoyed the company of his own daughter in his house.

If this was indeed the case, we can wonder whether Jairus ever thought about this woman, whether he noticed that she was missing or remembered that she was excluded from God‚Äôs house. Perhaps he did not even give her a second thought all these years. But now, at the moment when his daughter lay desperately ill, when time was of the essence to heal her, this same woman delayed Jesus from coming to Jairus's home.
And it is certain that Jairus noticed her when he was with Jesus.

What could have been going on in Jairus‚Äôs heart at that moment?
Was he angry at her for delaying Jesus?
Did he want her to just go away?

All those thoughts would have come crashing down in the moment when he heard Jesus call her his ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù, and then in the next moment to hear his servant say: ‚ÄúDo not trouble the master: your daughter is dead.‚Äù

By causing Jairus to reflect on the condition of his own daughter, and upon the pain he now felt at being separated from her, Jesus willed to arouse in Jairus a new sense of compassion for this woman whom he had not recognized as God‚Äôs daughter for 12 years.

If we are God‚Äôs children, then we all belong to one spiritual family.
Let us ensure that we take care of our spiritual family members (Christians) during their difficult times.
Let us also ensure to check on those who are missing from among us so that the whole family is present during Mass.

Mark 6:31
\*People were coming and going in great numbers, so that Jesus and His Apostles had no opportunity even to eat.  So Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúCome away by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.‚Äù\*

Jesus wanted the disciples to rest physically so that they could reflect spiritually on their mission.  He wanted them to guard themselves against burnout.
God wants us to work for six days and rest on the seventh day because the seventh day must be dedicated to spending time with God, and Satan uses fatigue to separate us from God and our families.  Fatigue causes irritation which leads to anger and thus disturbs the peace and happiness around us.

When the devil can‚Äôt make us bad, he makes us busy, because God does not speak to us when our bodies and minds are busy.  God speaks to us (through our thoughts) only when our bodies are relaxed, our minds are at peace and there‚Äôs silence around.

### DAY 156: By Sheila

In today's Study, Jesus reached out to the Gentiles even in seemingly hopeless situations. Healing demon possessed cases of powerful evil forces, apparently of fallen angels who are part of Satan's rebellious ones. They work in the arena of the mind, causing people to believe lies and  embrace worldly wisdom.

Jesus always commanded them to depart. The void left in the person's life was to be filled by New Life, the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit, to walk in the Holy Spirit fullness.

The bleeding unclean woman, when she touched Jesus, He made her clean. All who came to Him had seen the miracles and heard life-changing teachings.

Many heard the circumstances surrounding His Birth and rejected Him, His hometown as well. Jesus equipped those who believed Him and sent them to do the work of the Kingdom.

John the Baptist refused to cover the adultery of Herod Antipas and Herodias. John was finally beheaded and put to death. The family was ruthless. He even stole his brother Philip's wife.

The feeding of 5,000 that Jesus performed was to verify that the Kingdom was being offered, provision for feasts, A training for His Disciples, A mission to feed the hungry with the little they had.

JESUS THE CHIEF SHEPHERD would supply all needs.

The Psalm is a thanksgiving for God's Blessings. The God who has brought Victories to His People ALWAYS, in the past, could be trusted to grant our future victories too.
