### Wisdom is Beautiful

[![Wisdom is Beautiful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day306.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Bx7Kp2AnF_M "Wisdom is Beautiful")

### Day 306 Wisdom defined

The word wisdom is understood as the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise. Someone could have wisdom about certain topics. However, the wisdom spoken about in the book of wisdom has a very deep meaning

For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,
23unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
24For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.
25 For she is a breath of the might of God. Wisdom 7:22-27

I seems like wisdom seems to be giving us a small sample of the nature of God. For wisdom is defined as holy, all-powerful, all-seeing which are also attributes of God.
So when we read the book of wisdom we should admire the deeper meaning when the author refers to wisdom.
We should take some time to sit down and pray ‚Äì possibly ponder of each of the below attributes of wisdom.

01. Spirit
02. Intelligent
03. Holy
04. Unique
05. Manifold
06. Subtle
07. Agile
08. Clear
09. Unstained
10. Certain
11. Never harmful
12. Loving the good
13. Keen
14. Unhampered
15. Beneficent
16. Kindly
17. Firm
18. Secure
19. Tranquil
20. all-powerful
21. all-seeing
22. pervading all spirits
23. Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion
24. penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity
25. breath of the might of God

As we ponder on these 25 attributes let us remember that we cannot define God or even understand his wisdom.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 1 Cor 1:25

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Courage in Battle

[![Courage in Battle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day307.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Pi-1cVOzSK4 "Courage in Battle")

### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Little by Little

[![Little by Little](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day308.jpg)](https://youtu.be/EfS1EQOPm8U "Little by Little")

### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God‚Äôs horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God‚Äôs power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord‚Äôs people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God‚Äôs horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know ‚Äì God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 308 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind;  And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us.  Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins.  Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.

### Praying for the Dead

[![Praying for the Dead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day309.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3TAqAFIpp30 "Praying for the Dead")

### Day 309 Praying for the dead

Judas Maccabeus fought more battles and was victories. In one of the battles some of his men were killed, given that it was the Sabbath they decided to go get the dead after they celebrated the sabbath.

On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs.
40But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.

He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, in as much as he had the resurrection in mind;
44for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
45But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
46Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin. 2 maccabees12: 39-40, 43-46

It may seem strange for them to do a collection of money and they offer a sin offering on behalf of the dead. Given that fact that they found the idols of Jamnia on them. In some for the Jewish men had committed idolatry. Why pray for them, Judas could have just declared that they died because of the just punishment and forgotten about them.

Praying for the dead is nothing new that the Catholics came up with, it‚Äôs a practice observed by the Jews. But why should we pray for the dead if they either go to heaven or hell. The only possible reason would be if there is a place of purification called purgatory where people with some minor sins await entry into heaven. Because God is so pure and holy, we would need to be fully purified to feel worthy of His presence. Hence the need for a place called purgatory.

As we recently celebrated All Souls Day, where we would have prayed for the dead in our family. Let us not forget to offer prayers for the souls in purgatory, especially for those souls that need a lot of prayer. Making sacrifices and Offering indulgences for them can speed up their entry into eternal bliss. Let us also teach our children to pray for the souls in purgatory, so when we die someone will pray for us also. üôÇ

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Rivals for the Heart

[![Rivals for the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day310.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3qZbUdJeNHc "Rivals for the Heart")

### Day 310 Patient Perseverance

‚ÄúBy patience is a ruler persuaded,
and a soft tongue can break a bone.‚Äù Prov 25:15

Many a thing in life is not achieved because we give up or give in. We start off with great zeal and fire to accomplish the goal, but on the way we either get distracted, discouraged, or impatient. Today‚Äôs proverb helps us to understand that some things in life require persistence and long-lasting effort.

For example when we open up the WhatsApp group for people to join ‚Äúthe Bible in a Year‚Äù program there are so many zealous ones who want to complete it. But we can always see a steady decline in the folks that are committed to completing the program. Although many successfully complete it in a year, most people like me may take 2 years or some 3. It is totally fine if you are not able to keep up due to life‚Äôs demands. God is merciful and gives us our whole life to read the Bible, also it is more important that the word becomes flesh. Head knowledge is good, but we also have to internalize the Bible and live it out, which is not easy. But we always have God‚Äôs mercy and kindness who helps us in our weakness, guides us in our difficulties and sustains us to complete the good deed that we have started.

We need to be calm and assertive trying our best to navigate life and live a Christ-centric life. When we have bad rulers or bad policies then pushing back hard against them may not work. We need to consistently oppose bad policies and rulers until our voice is heard and we need to pray for long-lasting motivation.

We see many examples in the world that we can learn from.

1. Thomas Edison did not give up trying to invent the light bulb after testing thousands of materials that would not make the right filament.

2. Look at Lincoln‚Äôs resume before he was elected president. Despite a past littered with failures; he became one of, if not the greatest Presidents of the United States.

3. Saint Frances Cabrini (‚ÄúMother Cabrini‚Äù). Despite her frail health and her strong desire to go to China, she was advised by the Pope to go west to America and minister to the immigrant population. Mother Cabrini founded sixty-seven institutions, including schools, hospitals, and orphanages, one for each of her sixty-seven years of life on this earth. She was also the first naturalized American Saint. A great example of what one person can do against all odds.

4. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton came from wealth, was married with children, and lived quite a different life from the widowed convert who was to found the Sisters of Charity and become the first American-born saint.

5. Saint Martin de Porres of Lima, Peru was the child of a black mother and a Spanish father. Because of this, he was ridiculed and severely mocked. However, through his great perseverance and humility, he was finally accepted into the Dominican order he so earnestly yearned to join and became a model for those who seek God through poverty, sacrifice, penance, and humility.

Let us be inspired by these examples in our lives and preserve with all our strength and energy to achieve what we have set out to do. Heaven is the biggest goal of our lives and we should persevere till the end to reach our goal. Of course, God will always pick us up every time we fall and carry us into heaven as long as our heart is set on Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### God Fights for You

[![God Fights for You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day311.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PzsctVQ5s4I "God Fights for You")

### Day 311 Helping a troubled heart.

When we see troubled people, we usually either avoid them or try to cheer them on. Some people even go to the extent of betraying or abandoning someone when they are in trouble. This could be really hard on someone who desperately needs support.

The other approach some take is to try to cheer up the troubled person. Buy them a drink or try to  their minds with something or the other. This does not really help the person in trouble. The proverb in today‚Äôs reading teaches us just that.

A bad tooth or an unsteady foot‚Äî
a trust betrayed in time of trouble.
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
is the one who sings to a troubled heart. ‚Äì Proverbs 25:19-20

So what should be the right approach to someone who is in distress?
First thing to be done is to notice a person in trouble, in the parable of the good Smartian the priest and the Levite both did not even notice the person who was robbed and beaten.
But the Samaritan was moved with compassion, he stopped, took care of his wounds and even paid for his stay at an inn.

We should follow the approach of the good Smartian, be attentive to troubled people around us. We should do everything that we can to help out anyone who may be in trouble.
We are called to carry each other‚Äôs burdens.

‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Gal 6:2

We should always make friends and have each other‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their work; If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up.‚Äù Ecc 4:9-10

How pitiful it would be if you had no one who has your back, no one to pick you up when you fall. It usually would be the case if you did not pick someone up when they needed help. In the world we seem to be getting more and more isolated, we call it independence but I think we are missing out on something great.
We are God‚Äôs hands and God‚Äôs feet in this world. God promised that he would be close to the broken hearted. Let us make it our mission to be God‚Äôs hand and feet to the broken hearted person.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Ps 34:18

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Conclusion to the Old Testament

[![Conclusion to the Old Testament](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day312.jpg)](https://youtu.be/H2vXfX9lwdk "Conclusion to the Old Testament")

### Day 312 Rely fully on God

The great warrior Judas Maccabeus who won many battles where he was outnumbered, did not win by his own strength or the strength of his army. He always relied on the arm of God and the angels that God sent ahead of his battles.
Maccabeus, surveying the hosts before him, the variety of weaponry, and the fierceness of their beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he knew that it is not weapons but the Lord‚Äôs decision that brings victory to those who deserve it.

22Calling upon God, he spoke in this manner: ‚ÄúYou, master, sent your angel in the days of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand men of Sennacherib‚Äôs camp.
23And now, Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to spread fear and trembling ahead of us.
24By the might of your arm may those be struck down who have blasphemously come against your holy people!‚Äù With these words he ended his prayer. 2 Maccabees 15:21-24

Let us learn this and apply it to life, we should try our best but rely fully on God to give us the victory. God will send his workers - ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù to fight for us and make a way for us to progress.
For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; Ps 91:11

God has placed a guardian angel in charge of us, also other angels play in important part in our lives. So let us now forget to invoke their help especially when we are on mission to do something.
Like the Israelite kings and leaders, we should not just put all our trust in our chariots and horses but depend fully on God. We should not just trust our education, financial backing, doctors and medicine, but we should know that all these are but a gift from God and that we rely on God for everything.

Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. Ps 20:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### The Ark of the New Covenant

### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

5. The Crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:18-30)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 313 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 1:24-27
*After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion.*
Why did Elizabeth remain in seclusion when she was the recipient of a miracle and the bearer of such good news?

In the Jewish culture, it was as disgraceful for a woman to be with child in her old age, as it was for a woman to be barren.  According to the Jews, a barren woman was a curse for society, and an old woman with child was looked down upon as a woman of ill repute.  Elizabeth, therefore, had to remain in seclusion so that the negativity would not have any negative emotional effect on her and on the child during the first five months of her pregnancy.

*She said, ‚Äúthe Lord has blessed me at a time when He has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.‚Äù*
These were the same words spoken by Rachel when the Lord blessed her with a child, because she was childless for many years. (Genesis 30:23).

*Six months later, the angel Gabriel was sent down by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph.  The Virgin‚Äôs name was Mary.*\
God sent His angel to ask Mary‚Äôs permission to be the mother of His Son.
We therefore honor Mary because God honored her first.

The first Exodus began when an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb and appointed him for the mission (Exodus 3:1-4).

The new Exodus began when Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and appointed her for the mission.

Betrothal involved sharing one cup of wine between the man and woman as a sign of acceptance of each other.
In the modern times the couple exchanges rings.

The fundamental point which is underscored by the virgin birth is that since Jesus doesn‚Äôt have a human father; His father must be looked for outside of the human realm.  His Father is not on earth but in Heaven because His Father is God.

Mary pleased God more than any other women did, and God was so pleased with her, that the new Adam took flesh and bone from her, the new Eve, and she became His immediate blood relative, an unparalleled honor.

In preparing herself more and more for the Savior, God transformed Mary, the Ark of the new Covenant, making her His mother, so that from an ordinary human being, she became His perfect resting place.

God continues to look for sincere and humble hearts preparing themselves for Him to rest in.\
Like Mary, when we carry Jesus in our hearts like a true family member, through our holy and obedient life, we will enable Him to make the world His resting place and thereby His own family.

Let us join our character to Mary‚Äôs so that we can make a perfect resting place in our hearts for her Son.

Luke 1:31-33
*And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus ("Yeshua" in Hebrew).*
During the incarnation, when the angel spoke and Mary gave her acceptance, the Word of God became flesh, and divine life (Jesus) entered a pure vessel (Mary) and thus a human (Mary) had a share in the divine life.

Similarly, the incarnational principle is applied when we receive the Bread of Life (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), after giving our acceptance (Amen) and thereafter we receive divine life (2 Peter 1:4).

*He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.*
Angel Gabriel quoted to Mary from God‚Äôs prophecy to David (2 Samuel 7: 12-16).

The angel had just announced to Mary that her son would be the future King in the Davidic kingdom.  By default, that made Mary (a descendant of David) (Romans 1:3) the future Queen Mother according to the pattern of the Davidic kingdom.

Luke 1:38
*"May it be done to me according to your Word."*
Surrendering our will to God is NOT when we say *"Lord, I will do as you say."*
Surrendering our will to God is when we say, like Mary, *" may it be done to me, Lord, according to Your Will/Word"* and like Jesus *‚Äú may Your will be done, Lord, not mine‚Äù* (Mark 14:32).

Mary understood that she was only a creature and had no power to carry out God's Will with her human abilities. Whatever God wanted to do through her had to be completely in God's control and power because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is strong resistance from the demonic spirit and humans cannot handle the demons without divine assistance.

This means that when God starts using us to carry out His Will we are bound to go through trials, tribulations, persecution and we may even have to give up our life.  The important thing is that through this journey we must ensure that we protect the purity of our soul, and not the safety of our body.

God is Spirit and therefore He prefers to use our bodies to do His Will on earth.  Let us surrender ourselves to His Will completely, like Mary and Jesus, irrespective of the storms we will have to face.  That is when we trust God.

A godly man will not have marital union with a woman unless he marries her with her whole hearted consent.  Angel Gabriel was therefore sent by the Holy Spirit to Mary with a marriage proposal.  When Mary gave her consent the Word of God became flesh in her womb and she became the spouse of the Holy Spirit, who works along with her, for the sanctification of the human race, to unite people to the Body of Christ.

Luke 1:40-41
Mary was already filled with the Holy Spirit when the Body of Christ was in her womb, therefore when she spoke the greeting (shalom) she poured out the Holy Spirit onto Elizabeth and onto the baby in Elizabeth‚Äôs womb.\
This was the time when John was baptized with the Holy Spirit thereby making him the bridegroom‚Äôs friend or ‚Äúbest man‚Äù who would prepare Israel for the coming of the bridegroom.

Jewish marriages always began with an inaugural dance, and John‚Äôs leaping in the womb was the symbolic dance of the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù to inaugurate the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) in Mary‚Äôs womb.

Similarly, in the infant Church, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and Cornelius and his household were eagerly listening to the Word from Peter, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard Peter (Acts 10:44).

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is automatically poured out onto those who eagerly hear the Word of God from us.

John was in his mother's womb and could not see Jesus in Mary‚Äôs womb, but John recognized the presence of Jesus through the voice of Mary.  Jesus spoke through His mother‚Äôs voice.

Let us humble ourselves like Mary so that Jesus can use our voices to speak to others and bless them.

Luke 1:42
Through the power of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth declared that Mary was blessed among all women.

Elizabeth represents all of those who pray the ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù prayer.  When we say the prayer, Mary visits us, to help us during our difficult times, just as she did with Elizabeth.

Luke 1:43
It wasn't Elizabeth, but the Holy Spirit, who addressed Mary as the ‚ÄúMother of my Lord‚Äù because neither was Elizabeth informed in advance in any way that Mary was with child nor did Mary explain anything to Elizabeth when she entered the house.

Luke 2:1-2\
Emperor Augustus considered himself to be a god and therefore wanted all his subjects to be registered in his kingdom so that he could increase his tax revenue.

But God wants us to be registered with His holy Kingdom (the Church), through baptism, so that we belong to His holy family to be with Him for eternity.

Luke 2:6-7
‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Hebrew means ‚ÄúHouse of Meat‚Äù and Hebrew is the language of the original old Testament books.

During the old Covenant Passover celebration, the congregation had to consume the meat of an earthly lamb.
This was a foreshadow of the Passover of the new Covenant.

‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Greek means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù and Greek is the language of the original new Testament books.

During the new Covenant Passover celebration (the Mass), the congregation has to consume the consecrated unleavened bread (Communion) which is the living mystical Body of the Lamb of God (Luke 22:19; John 6:54).

All this happened according to God‚Äôs plan.\
This is how God announced to the world that the Bread of Life (Jesus) was delivered at the House of Bread (Bethlehem) and was already served in the food box (manger) for the world to eat so that we can now have eternal life (John 6:54).

And God, therefore, made sure that David himself was born in Bethlehem.

*There was no room for them in the inn.*
There was no room for them in the inn (or guest houses) due to the influx of people who returned to their home town to enroll themselves.  They were therefore rejected by the world.
Rejection by the world can often lead to God‚Äôs greater plan being unveiled.

The inn was a symbol of our hearts.
When our hearts are filled with things of this world we become heartless, selfish and disrespectful and thus there is no room for Jesus in our hearts.

Jesus was born in the stable only because the humble shepherds made room for His mother to bring Him into their home.

Let us ask the mother of Jesus to guide us so that we can humble ourselves to make room in our hearts and she can bring her Son into our homes.

### DAY 313 By Sheila

LUKE. 1:5-25
An Angel appears to Zechariah and assured him of his prayers, his wife would bear a child, a son, to be named John.
When his service time was completed, he returned home to see his wife pregnant. There were litany of Praises to Our Awesome God.
His Power to bring fruitfulness, out of fertility and bring God's Will to fulfillment. God manifest His Might, not just by making the impossible possible but building on them His Great Plan of Salvation.

LUKE. 1:26-38
This speaks of Advent, The Lord Enters. He is the King Of Glory.
God's love for humanity is such that, He became like us. He chose His Son to be born through a Virgin, thus fulfilling the Prophecy that is part of God's Plan to save us. So much so that our human plans would fit his designs.
Like Mary, let us say: Let it be done to me as You have said.
