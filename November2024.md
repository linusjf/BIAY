### Wisdom is Beautiful

[![Wisdom is Beautiful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day306.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Bx7Kp2AnF_M "Wisdom is Beautiful")

### Day 306 Wisdom defined

The word wisdom is understood as the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise. Someone could have wisdom about certain topics. However, the wisdom spoken about in the book of wisdom has a very deep meaning

For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,
23unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
24For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.
25 For she is a breath of the might of God. Wisdom 7:22-27

I seems like wisdom seems to be giving us a small sample of the nature of God. For wisdom is defined as holy, all-powerful, all-seeing which are also attributes of God.
So when we read the book of wisdom we should admire the deeper meaning when the author refers to wisdom.
We should take some time to sit down and pray ‚Äì possibly ponder of each of the below attributes of wisdom.

01. Spirit
02. Intelligent
03. Holy
04. Unique
05. Manifold
06. Subtle
07. Agile
08. Clear
09. Unstained
10. Certain
11. Never harmful
12. Loving the good
13. Keen
14. Unhampered
15. Beneficent
16. Kindly
17. Firm
18. Secure
19. Tranquil
20. all-powerful
21. all-seeing
22. pervading all spirits
23. Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion
24. penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity
25. breath of the might of God

As we ponder on these 25 attributes let us remember that we cannot define God or even understand his wisdom.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 1 Cor 1:25

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Courage in Battle

[![Courage in Battle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day307.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Pi-1cVOzSK4 "Courage in Battle")

### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Little by Little

[![Little by Little](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day308.jpg)](https://youtu.be/EfS1EQOPm8U "Little by Little")

### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God‚Äôs horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God‚Äôs power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord‚Äôs people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God‚Äôs horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know ‚Äì God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 308 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind;  And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us.  Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins.  Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.

### Praying for the Dead

[![Praying for the Dead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day309.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3TAqAFIpp30 "Praying for the Dead")

### Day 309 Praying for the dead

Judas Maccabeus fought more battles and was victories. In one of the battles some of his men were killed, given that it was the Sabbath they decided to go get the dead after they celebrated the sabbath.

On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs.
40But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.

He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, in as much as he had the resurrection in mind;
44for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
45But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
46Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin. 2 maccabees12: 39-40, 43-46

It may seem strange for them to do a collection of money and they offer a sin offering on behalf of the dead. Given that fact that they found the idols of Jamnia on them. In some for the Jewish men had committed idolatry. Why pray for them, Judas could have just declared that they died because of the just punishment and forgotten about them.

Praying for the dead is nothing new that the Catholics came up with, it‚Äôs a practice observed by the Jews. But why should we pray for the dead if they either go to heaven or hell. The only possible reason would be if there is a place of purification called purgatory where people with some minor sins await entry into heaven. Because God is so pure and holy, we would need to be fully purified to feel worthy of His presence. Hence the need for a place called purgatory.

As we recently celebrated All Souls Day, where we would have prayed for the dead in our family. Let us not forget to offer prayers for the souls in purgatory, especially for those souls that need a lot of prayer. Making sacrifices and Offering indulgences for them can speed up their entry into eternal bliss. Let us also teach our children to pray for the souls in purgatory, so when we die someone will pray for us also. üôÇ

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Rivals for the Heart

[![Rivals for the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day310.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3qZbUdJeNHc "Rivals for the Heart")

### Day 310 Patient Perseverance

‚ÄúBy patience is a ruler persuaded,
and a soft tongue can break a bone.‚Äù Prov 25:15

Many a thing in life is not achieved because we give up or give in. We start off with great zeal and fire to accomplish the goal, but on the way we either get distracted, discouraged, or impatient. Today‚Äôs proverb helps us to understand that some things in life require persistence and long-lasting effort.

For example when we open up the WhatsApp group for people to join ‚Äúthe Bible in a Year‚Äù program there are so many zealous ones who want to complete it. But we can always see a steady decline in the folks that are committed to completing the program. Although many successfully complete it in a year, most people like me may take 2 years or some 3. It is totally fine if you are not able to keep up due to life‚Äôs demands. God is merciful and gives us our whole life to read the Bible, also it is more important that the word becomes flesh. Head knowledge is good, but we also have to internalize the Bible and live it out, which is not easy. But we always have God‚Äôs mercy and kindness who helps us in our weakness, guides us in our difficulties and sustains us to complete the good deed that we have started.

We need to be calm and assertive trying our best to navigate life and live a Christ-centric life. When we have bad rulers or bad policies then pushing back hard against them may not work. We need to consistently oppose bad policies and rulers until our voice is heard and we need to pray for long-lasting motivation.

We see many examples in the world that we can learn from.

1. Thomas Edison did not give up trying to invent the light bulb after testing thousands of materials that would not make the right filament.

2. Look at Lincoln‚Äôs resume before he was elected president. Despite a past littered with failures; he became one of, if not the greatest Presidents of the United States.

3. Saint Frances Cabrini (‚ÄúMother Cabrini‚Äù). Despite her frail health and her strong desire to go to China, she was advised by the Pope to go west to America and minister to the immigrant population. Mother Cabrini founded sixty-seven institutions, including schools, hospitals, and orphanages, one for each of her sixty-seven years of life on this earth. She was also the first naturalized American Saint. A great example of what one person can do against all odds.

4. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton came from wealth, was married with children, and lived quite a different life from the widowed convert who was to found the Sisters of Charity and become the first American-born saint.

5. Saint Martin de Porres of Lima, Peru was the child of a black mother and a Spanish father. Because of this, he was ridiculed and severely mocked. However, through his great perseverance and humility, he was finally accepted into the Dominican order he so earnestly yearned to join and became a model for those who seek God through poverty, sacrifice, penance, and humility.

Let us be inspired by these examples in our lives and preserve with all our strength and energy to achieve what we have set out to do. Heaven is the biggest goal of our lives and we should persevere till the end to reach our goal. Of course, God will always pick us up every time we fall and carry us into heaven as long as our heart is set on Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### God Fights for You

[![God Fights for You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day311.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PzsctVQ5s4I "God Fights for You")

### Day 311 Helping a troubled heart.

When we see troubled people, we usually either avoid them or try to cheer them on. Some people even go to the extent of betraying or abandoning someone when they are in trouble. This could be really hard on someone who desperately needs support.

The other approach some take is to try to cheer up the troubled person. Buy them a drink or try to  their minds with something or the other. This does not really help the person in trouble. The proverb in today‚Äôs reading teaches us just that.

A bad tooth or an unsteady foot‚Äî
a trust betrayed in time of trouble.
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
is the one who sings to a troubled heart. ‚Äì Proverbs 25:19-20

So what should be the right approach to someone who is in distress?
First thing to be done is to notice a person in trouble, in the parable of the good Smartian the priest and the Levite both did not even notice the person who was robbed and beaten.
But the Samaritan was moved with compassion, he stopped, took care of his wounds and even paid for his stay at an inn.

We should follow the approach of the good Smartian, be attentive to troubled people around us. We should do everything that we can to help out anyone who may be in trouble.
We are called to carry each other‚Äôs burdens.

‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Gal 6:2

We should always make friends and have each other‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their work; If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up.‚Äù Ecc 4:9-10

How pitiful it would be if you had no one who has your back, no one to pick you up when you fall. It usually would be the case if you did not pick someone up when they needed help. In the world we seem to be getting more and more isolated, we call it independence but I think we are missing out on something great.
We are God‚Äôs hands and God‚Äôs feet in this world. God promised that he would be close to the broken hearted. Let us make it our mission to be God‚Äôs hand and feet to the broken hearted person.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Ps 34:18

### Conclusion to the Old Testament

[![Conclusion to the Old Testament](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day312.jpg)](https://youtu.be/H2vXfX9lwdk "Conclusion to the Old Testament")

### Day 312 Rely fully on God

The great warrior Judas Maccabeus who won many battles where he was outnumbered, did not win by his own strength or the strength of his army. He always relied on the arm of God and the angels that God sent ahead of his battles.
Maccabeus, surveying the hosts before him, the variety of weaponry, and the fierceness of their beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he knew that it is not weapons but the Lord‚Äôs decision that brings victory to those who deserve it.

22Calling upon God, he spoke in this manner: ‚ÄúYou, master, sent your angel in the days of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand men of Sennacherib‚Äôs camp.
23And now, Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to spread fear and trembling ahead of us.
24By the might of your arm may those be struck down who have blasphemously come against your holy people!‚Äù With these words he ended his prayer. 2 Maccabees 15:21-24

Let us learn this and apply it to life, we should try our best but rely fully on God to give us the victory. God will send his workers - ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù to fight for us and make a way for us to progress.
For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; Ps 91:11

God has placed a guardian angel in charge of us, also other angels play in important part in our lives. So let us now forget to invoke their help especially when we are on mission to do something.
Like the Israelite kings and leaders, we should not just put all our trust in our chariots and horses but depend fully on God. We should not just trust our education, financial backing, doctors and medicine, but we should know that all these are but a gift from God and that we rely on God for everything.

Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. Ps 20:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

5. The Crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:18-30)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 313 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 1:24-27
*After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion.*
Why did Elizabeth remain in seclusion when she was the recipient of a miracle and the bearer of such good news?

In the Jewish culture, it was as disgraceful for a woman to be with child in her old age, as it was for a woman to be barren.  According to the Jews, a barren woman was a curse for society, and an old woman with child was looked down upon as a woman of ill repute.  Elizabeth, therefore, had to remain in seclusion so that the negativity would not have any negative emotional effect on her and on the child during the first five months of her pregnancy.

*She said, ‚Äúthe Lord has blessed me at a time when He has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.‚Äù*
These were the same words spoken by Rachel when the Lord blessed her with a child, because she was childless for many years. (Genesis 30:23).

*Six months later, the angel Gabriel was sent down by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph.  The Virgin‚Äôs name was Mary.*\
God sent His angel to ask Mary‚Äôs permission to be the mother of His Son.
We therefore honor Mary because God honored her first.

The first Exodus began when an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb and appointed him for the mission (Exodus 3:1-4).

The new Exodus began when Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and appointed her for the mission.

Betrothal involved sharing one cup of wine between the man and woman as a sign of acceptance of each other.
In the modern times the couple exchanges rings.

The fundamental point which is underscored by the virgin birth is that since Jesus doesn‚Äôt have a human father; His father must be looked for outside of the human realm.  His Father is not on earth but in Heaven because His Father is God.

Mary pleased God more than any other women did, and God was so pleased with her, that the new Adam took flesh and bone from her, the new Eve, and she became His immediate blood relative, an unparalleled honor.

In preparing herself more and more for the Savior, God transformed Mary, the Ark of the new Covenant, making her His mother, so that from an ordinary human being, she became His perfect resting place.

God continues to look for sincere and humble hearts preparing themselves for Him to rest in.\
Like Mary, when we carry Jesus in our hearts like a true family member, through our holy and obedient life, we will enable Him to make the world His resting place and thereby His own family.

Let us join our character to Mary‚Äôs so that we can make a perfect resting place in our hearts for her Son.

Luke 1:31-33
*And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus ("Yeshua" in Hebrew).*
During the incarnation, when the angel spoke and Mary gave her acceptance, the Word of God became flesh, and divine life (Jesus) entered a pure vessel (Mary) and thus a human (Mary) had a share in the divine life.

Similarly, the incarnational principle is applied when we receive the Bread of Life (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), after giving our acceptance (Amen) and thereafter we receive divine life (2 Peter 1:4).

*He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.*
Angel Gabriel quoted to Mary from God‚Äôs prophecy to David (2 Samuel 7: 12-16).

The angel had just announced to Mary that her son would be the future King in the Davidic kingdom.  By default, that made Mary (a descendant of David) (Romans 1:3) the future Queen Mother according to the pattern of the Davidic kingdom.

Luke 1:38
*"May it be done to me according to your Word."*
Surrendering our will to God is NOT when we say *"Lord, I will do as you say."*
Surrendering our will to God is when we say, like Mary, *" may it be done to me, Lord, according to Your Will/Word"* and like Jesus *‚Äú may Your will be done, Lord, not mine‚Äù* (Mark 14:32).

Mary understood that she was only a creature and had no power to carry out God's Will with her human abilities. Whatever God wanted to do through her had to be completely in God's control and power because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is strong resistance from the demonic spirit and humans cannot handle the demons without divine assistance.

This means that when God starts using us to carry out His Will we are bound to go through trials, tribulations, persecution and we may even have to give up our life.  The important thing is that through this journey we must ensure that we protect the purity of our soul, and not the safety of our body.

God is Spirit and therefore He prefers to use our bodies to do His Will on earth.  Let us surrender ourselves to His Will completely, like Mary and Jesus, irrespective of the storms we will have to face.  That is when we trust God.

A godly man will not have marital union with a woman unless he marries her with her whole hearted consent.  Angel Gabriel was therefore sent by the Holy Spirit to Mary with a marriage proposal.  When Mary gave her consent the Word of God became flesh in her womb and she became the spouse of the Holy Spirit, who works along with her, for the sanctification of the human race, to unite people to the Body of Christ.

Luke 1:40-41
Mary was already filled with the Holy Spirit when the Body of Christ was in her womb, therefore when she spoke the greeting (shalom) she poured out the Holy Spirit onto Elizabeth and onto the baby in Elizabeth‚Äôs womb.\
This was the time when John was baptized with the Holy Spirit thereby making him the bridegroom‚Äôs friend or ‚Äúbest man‚Äù who would prepare Israel for the coming of the bridegroom.

Jewish marriages always began with an inaugural dance, and John‚Äôs leaping in the womb was the symbolic dance of the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù to inaugurate the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) in Mary‚Äôs womb.

Similarly, in the infant Church, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and Cornelius and his household were eagerly listening to the Word from Peter, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard Peter (Acts 10:44).

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is automatically poured out onto those who eagerly hear the Word of God from us.

John was in his mother's womb and could not see Jesus in Mary‚Äôs womb, but John recognized the presence of Jesus through the voice of Mary.  Jesus spoke through His mother‚Äôs voice.

Let us humble ourselves like Mary so that Jesus can use our voices to speak to others and bless them.

Luke 1:42
Through the power of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth declared that Mary was blessed among all women.

Elizabeth represents all of those who pray the ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù prayer.  When we say the prayer, Mary visits us, to help us during our difficult times, just as she did with Elizabeth.

Luke 1:43
It wasn't Elizabeth, but the Holy Spirit, who addressed Mary as the ‚ÄúMother of my Lord‚Äù because neither was Elizabeth informed in advance in any way that Mary was with child nor did Mary explain anything to Elizabeth when she entered the house.

Luke 2:1-2\
Emperor Augustus considered himself to be a god and therefore wanted all his subjects to be registered in his kingdom so that he could increase his tax revenue.

But God wants us to be registered with His holy Kingdom (the Church), through baptism, so that we belong to His holy family to be with Him for eternity.

Luke 2:6-7
‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Hebrew means ‚ÄúHouse of Meat‚Äù and Hebrew is the language of the original old Testament books.

During the old Covenant Passover celebration, the congregation had to consume the meat of an earthly lamb.
This was a foreshadow of the Passover of the new Covenant.

‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Greek means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù and Greek is the language of the original new Testament books.

During the new Covenant Passover celebration (the Mass), the congregation has to consume the consecrated unleavened bread (Communion) which is the living mystical Body of the Lamb of God (Luke 22:19; John 6:54).

All this happened according to God‚Äôs plan.\
This is how God announced to the world that the Bread of Life (Jesus) was delivered at the House of Bread (Bethlehem) and was already served in the food box (manger) for the world to eat so that we can now have eternal life (John 6:54).

And God, therefore, made sure that David himself was born in Bethlehem.

*There was no room for them in the inn.*
There was no room for them in the inn (or guest houses) due to the influx of people who returned to their home town to enroll themselves.  They were therefore rejected by the world.
Rejection by the world can often lead to God‚Äôs greater plan being unveiled.

The inn was a symbol of our hearts.
When our hearts are filled with things of this world we become heartless, selfish and disrespectful and thus there is no room for Jesus in our hearts.

Jesus was born in the stable only because the humble shepherds made room for His mother to bring Him into their home.

Let us ask the mother of Jesus to guide us so that we can humble ourselves to make room in our hearts and she can bring her Son into our homes.

### DAY 313 By Sheila

LUKE. 1:5-25
An Angel appears to Zechariah and assured him of his prayers, his wife would bear a child, a son, to be named John.
When his service time was completed, he returned home to see his wife pregnant. There were litany of Praises to Our Awesome God.
His Power to bring fruitfulness, out of fertility and bring God's Will to fulfillment. God manifest His Might, not just by making the impossible possible but building on them His Great Plan of Salvation.

LUKE. 1:26-38
This speaks of Advent, The Lord Enters. He is the King Of Glory.
God's love for humanity is such that, He became like us. He chose His Son to be born through a Virgin, thus fulfilling the Prophecy that is part of God's Plan to save us. So much so that our human plans would fit his designs.
Like Mary, let us say: Let it be done to me as You have said.

### My Beloved Son

[![My Beloved Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day314.jpg)](https://youtu.be/R2fNUca2HAw "My Beloved Son")

### Day 314 Overcome temptations with prayer and fasting.

At the Baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form and the voice of the Father was heard. ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you, I am well pleased.‚Äù As soon as that happened, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasted and was tempted by the devil in every way.
The new Adam is able to withstand the temptations of the devil, as compared to the Adam. It seems like the three temptations were similar to the ones that Adam faced.

1. Good
   If you are the Son of God, command the stones to become a loaf of bread. Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúIt is written, ‚ÄòOne does not live by bread alone.‚Äô‚Äù
   Jesus being fully human(and fully God) was truly in need of food as He had fasted for 40 days. Satan takes a natural good and twists it to confuse us, to make it seem good. Jesus could have done that Miracle just as he made water into wine, but Jesus could see the evil scheme of the devil. Eve and Adam could not resist the offer of the devil to eat the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.

‚ÄúThe woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes‚Äù Gen 3:6

We also can fall into the temptation of the lust of the eyes, we could say this is really good we should have it.

2. Power
   Then he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.

6The devil said to him, ‚ÄúI shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I may give it to whomever I wish. All this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚ÄòYou shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.‚Äô

Satan tempts Jesus with power. Jesus had not yet won the victory on the cross. Satan wanted to give Jesus a short cut around the Passion and agony that he would need to go through. But Jesus resisted for worship is only due to God, no person or object or thing or power deserves our worship.
Eve and Adam could not resist the temptation of power, they were going to get similar power as God or similar knowledge as God.
‚ÄúGod knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5
We also crave power, we crave to control situations and people. Who does not want their own way in matters. Let us keep it at check and offer all due worship to God, let‚Äôs just seek His will.

3. Distrust
   Then he led him to Jerusalem, made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
   10 for it is written:
   ‚ÄòHe will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,‚Äô and:‚ÄòWith their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.‚Äô‚Äù 12Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòYou shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test‚Äù
   Satan tried to push the buttons of distrust, he was like will not God send his angles when you will fall. So give it a test, try to fall and let‚Äôs see if it's true. Did not work, Jesus like the previous times quoted the scripture and confessed His belief.

Our first parents gave into the distrust ‚Äòtest‚Äô, and gave into doubt.
But the snake said to the woman: ‚ÄúYou certainly will not die!

5God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know\* good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

They were like what is God does not have our best interest in mind? What if God is so selfish that He wants to keep wisdom and power from all, just so that He can rule the world.
Satan will try to sow doubt in your minds, he will bring up a lot of negative thoughts about God. Will God really provide for you? Will he really heal you? Does God really love you, look how terrible you are? Will God really forgive you, you commit this sin over and over again.
We need to fight against these voices and believe the God is Good and loves us beyond our wildest imaginations. What God has for us no eye has seen no ear has heard, for the plans He has for us is for our own good.
Let us fight against temptations of the eyes, flesh and pride but fasting and prayer.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 314 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 3:10-14
*What then should we do?*

As John tells us, the most important thing to do is to repent.  We must examine our conscience and correct our errors before repenting.  But it is not sufficient only to repent.  John tells us that we must prove our faith through works of charity, honesty, and social justice.

We can start by sharing with the less fortunate whatever food and clothes that we have in excess (v. 11) because sharing is fundamental to our faith, not only after repentance, but always.\
John tells us that whatever job we do we must do it with honesty (v. 13).\
We must not let greed control us (v. 14).\
Whatever we do we must do it to please God.

One of the prominent marks in today‚Äôs world is the absence of guilt for sins, thus minimizing repentance or almost eliminating it.  Most people feel repentance is old fashioned.  Others make a show of repentance for personal gain.  Yet others may say a robotic ‚Äúsorry‚Äù only when they are caught.  But repentance is more than just saying robotic words or reading prayers of repentance from a book.  Repentance means turning around from our material lives, detaching ourselves from earthly bondage and following Christ with our whole heart.

John tells us to prepare our hearts to welcome the Lord.  He wants us to discard all the obstacles which block us from following Christ.
To prepare the way for the Lord in our hearts we must focus on the fundamentals of our faith which are *‚Äúrepentance, sharing and serving.‚Äù*

Luke 3:21-22
*The Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.

Original sin is the loss of divine life within us, which gives us sanctifying grace to perfect our souls and enables us to enter Heaven and stand in the presence of God.

When Jesus was baptised the Holy Spirit descended on the Son in the presence of the Father.

Likewise, when we are baptized we receive the life of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (divine life) within us. And whenever we destroy this divine life with our sins we can have it restored by receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace (Sacrament of Reconciliation / Confession), because we are baptized.

The old Covenant people did not have this privilege because their baptism was symbolic, not sacramental.

Luke 3:23
Like Matthew, Luke also focuses on the royal lineage of Jesus.
Matthew shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Solomon through Jacob, but Luke shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Nathan through Heli.

How could this be possible?

The Levirate law allowed a woman to marry a brother of her ex-husband (in the case of divorce), or the brother of her deceased husband (in the case of widowhood), even if, in both cases, the men already had children.  However, if the men, in both cases, did not have a brother or if the brother refused to marry her, then the woman was allowed to marry the next of kin of her previous husband, as in the case of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 4:13).

Joseph had a natural father (Jacob) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Solomon, and a legal father (Heli) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Nathan.

How could Jacob and his brother Heli have two different fathers?

Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha first married Matthan (a descendant of Solomon) and they became the parents of Jacob.

After the death of Matthan Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha then married Melchi (a descendant of Nathan, but of the same tribe) and they became the parents of Heli.

Heli married Joseph‚Äôs mother but he died without leaving any children.

Thereafter his brother Jacob married Joseph's mother and they became the parents of Joseph.

In short:
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the natural line were David > Solomon >>>> Matthan > Jacob.
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the legal line were David > Nathan >>>> Melchi > Heli.

It was important to protect the genealogical line of the Messiah because in order to be the Messiah, he had to be the prophetic ‚ÄúLion of the Tribe of Judah‚Äù (Genesis 49:10) and the ‚Äúroot of David‚Äù (2 Samuel 7:13-14;  (Revelation 5:5).

This is the main reason (among others) for the careful inclusions of the genealogies in both the Old and New Covenants.
It stresses the fact that the existence of these genealogies are not the result of human effort or holiness; they are wholly dependent upon the power of God that guarantees them.

Therefore, inspite of Satan‚Äôs efforts through the rebellion of all the ungrateful humans, God has still kept His promise of a Savior for the world from the line of Seth through Judah to Jesus.

Luke 4:1-12
Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us to remind us which scripture we can apply to a particular situation.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.

Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Jesus could have told the devil to go away but He did not because that would not be a good model for humans.  Due to the weakness of our souls we cannot beat the tricky and deceptive forces of evil on our own.  Jesus quoted scripture to overcome the devil to show us that we too must follow the same.

Luke 4:3 & 9
*Then the devil came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, ........*

Satan didn't say "if you are the prophet, priest or king......."
Satan was directly attacking the family relation between Jesus and His heavenly Father by challenging Jesus to defy His Father.

Satan tried the same trick with Adam and Eve by asking them, "did God say.......?"\
He twisted the Word of God, poisoned their minds against God their Father and succeeded in making them challenge God by disobeying Him.

Similarly, since all baptized people are the children of God, Satan will always try in many ways to tempt us with power, wealth, possessions, comfort, entertainment, etc. and by twisting the Word of God, to separate us from our heavenly Father.

Let us always be alert to the devil's tricks by reading the Word of God every day, daily prayers, obeying God's commandments in our daily lives, and regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion).

Humans are created in the image and likeness of God therefore family and human identity has been the devil's target.

Adam and Eve's minds were poisoned against God who created them.

In today‚Äôs world, divorces are increasing and young children are being brainwashed into believing that they can choose to belong to any gender they wish, if they are not happy with their gender.

Luke 4:3-12
Jesus began His public ministry with both prayer and fasting. This is a good formula for us in our lives.

Before we take any action, we should start with prayer, asking for God‚Äôs guidance and His Will in our lives.

Fasting is also beneficial for each one of us. When unchecked, our passions begin to rule us. However, by fasting and self-denial, we are reminding our passions of who is the boss. We then become more free to direct our lives towards what is truly good, and free to follow the good Lord more closely.

Luke 4:6
*"All these kingdoms have been handed over to me, and all this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù*
When the world was created, it belonged to Jesus in its sanctified form and it was handed over to Adam to rule over it.  But when Adam made a Covenant with Satan by disobeying God and eating the forbidden fruit, Adam automatically transferred his dominion to Satan, and thus Satan became the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30), which is why the power of evil was greater than the power of good, in the old Covenant.  We, the baptized ones, are now God's people living in an enemy occupied territory (the world).

Satan was telling Jesus that Jesus would get back all what initially belonged to Him, only if Jesus worshipped Satan.

Jesus didn't need Satan to hand the kingdoms of the world over to Him.  By His holy life, death and resurrection, Jesus gave us access to the fruit of life (the consecrated bread / Eucharist) and thus got us back the authority to rule over God's kingdom on earth (the Church) which Satan is trying to corrupt and destroy, internally and externally, just as he deceived Adam and Eve into destroying the sanctified world.

Luke 4:13
Although Jesus passed every test, Satan was not done with Jesus.  Satan was alert 24x7x12 waiting for a chance to trap Jesus again.  Throughout the ministry of Jesus we see Satan using the people around Jesus to overpower or destroy Jesus by their accusations, attempts to attack, tricky questions, etc.

When we have defeated the devil once, we cannot remain off-guard thinking that he will not attack us again.  Satan has a million ways of tricking people.  Whatever we are focused on, Satan will use that to lead us away from God, smoothly, without us having the slightest doubt that we are on the wrong path.  That is where our daily communication with God through prayers and reading the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes, will help us.

Let us stay alert to sin, pray every day for divine assistance and ensure that we read the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes

Luke 5:3
The crowds represent the flock of Christ and the boat represents the Church, the Ark of God.\
Jesus still speaks to His flock (the faithful Christians) from Simon's boat (the Church).

Luke 5:4
If we have tried sharing the Word of God with others, or doing other works for God, and failed in our mission, the Lord maybe just training us and preparing us to venture further into difficult areas.  Let us move ahead without hesitation because THE LORD WANTS US TO DO IT.

Luke 5:6
When we venture further into difficult areas in obedience to the Lord, inspite of our failures, the Lord will bless our efforts with so much abundance that we may not be able to handle it on our own and we may need assistance from our family, friends, relatives, colleagues, or anyone else.

### The Virtue of Mercy

[![The Virtue of Mercy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day315.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tHwiu0_6paw "The Virtue of Mercy")

### Day 315 Faith and Love

We see some great examples of faith, the Roman centurion whose servant was sick. The Centurion sent word for Jesus to come to his home but later realized that he was not worthy to have a holy man enter his house, so he went out to meet Jesus and petitioned the Lord with great words of faith.

And Jesus went with them, but when he was only a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, ‚ÄúLord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof.
7Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed.
8For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô and he goes; and to another, ‚ÄòCome here,‚Äô and he comes; and to my slave, ‚ÄòDo this,‚Äô and he does it.‚Äù
9When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and, turning, said to the crowd following him, ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
10When the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave in good health. Luke 7:6-10
We sometimes underestimate the power of God, we think that the Lord will work one way but do not realize that God just has to say a word and things will happen. We need to have faith when we pray, it should touch the heart of Jesus just as the centurion‚Äôs words did. Jesus should respond to our prayer ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
Along with faith we should also have love for the Lord. We see the example of Mary
A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee‚Äôs house and reclined at table.
37Now there was a sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an alabaster flask of ointment,
38she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment.
39When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself, ‚ÄúIf this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.‚Äù
40Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúSimon, I have something to say to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me, teacher,‚Äù he said.
41‚ÄúTwo people were in debt to a certain creditor; one owed five hundred days‚Äô wages\* and the other owed fifty.
42Since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both. Which of them will love him more?‚Äù
43Simon said in reply, ‚ÄúThe one, I suppose, whose larger debt was forgiven.‚Äù He said to him, ‚ÄúYou have judged rightly.‚Äù
44Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, ‚ÄúDo you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give me water for my feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
45You did not give me a kiss, but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered.
46You did not anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with ointment.
47So I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.‚Äù
48He said to her, ‚ÄúYour sins are forgiven.‚Äù
49The others at table said to themselves, ‚ÄúWho is this who even forgives sins?‚Äù
50But he said to the woman, ‚ÄúYour faith has saved you; go in peace.‚Äù

We see the beautiful expression of love that the sinful woman, many believe is Mary Magdalene. She had such love for the Lord that she didn‚Äôt hesitate to pour out costly ointment on his feet. How is our love for the Lord, do we love like the Pharisees or like the sinner? Do we love Jesus less or love Him more. Do we give to the poor and the church a little of our time, talent and treasure or give it freely.
Let us pray that we should have both faith and love for our dear Lord Jesus. Let us have faith believing that Jesus can do anything for us and love Him unendingly, I don‚Äôt know about you but I feel that Jesus has forgiven me a lot of my sins. He died for me and loves me dearly.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Absolute Surrender

[![Absolute Surrender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day316.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fJ4gt4sW5Y4 "Absolute Surrender")

### Day 316 Deny yourself and come follow me.

Many people come to Jesus for a reason, they either want to be healed or receive a favor. Jesus wants to heal and provide for us but He wants something more, a loving and living relationship. Jesus invites us to this beautiful relationship, like one of a shepherd and the sheep. Jesus calls the 12 and gives them authority to drive out demons and to heal the sick. When they return Jesus does more Miracles like the feeding of the 5000. He later sends out the 72 who are able to heal and deliver people from demon possession. What is more important than doing works for the Lord is knowing the Lord.

That is why Jesus asked His disciples Who do you say I am? To which Peter replied ‚ÄúThe Messiah of God.‚Äù We are called to discover Christ first before we decide to go out and do works for Him.

In discovering Christ we will have our moments of Transfiguration where Jesus will reveal Himself to us so that we will know that our God is the creator of the world, all-powerful, all-knowing and every loving.

Once we realize who calls us and what is our mission, we will be able to deny ourselves daily and pickup our cross and follow Jesus.

Then he said to all, ‚ÄúIf anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
24For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
25What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself?
26Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Luke 9:23-26

We are called to lose our life, keep our pride by the side, speak about Jesus openly with our friends and family. Take a stand for Jesus in the anti-life culture.

We sometimes like Peter, John and James may want to remain on Spiritual highs, build booths at the transfiguration and not come back to reality. Or like Martha, we may get overly anxious of the worries and cares of the day, that we so forget the Lord. One thing is needed and we should choose that. That is to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to every word He says.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Persistence in Prayer

[![Persistence in Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day317.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1Cq89cCv0SA "Persistence in Prayer")

### Day 317 Do not be anxious about tomorrow.

Most of us are such control freaks when it comes to our lives. We have our schedules booked out months in advance and holidays a year in advance. We know when we would upgrade our next iphone and when we should retire. Although it‚Äôs good to plan it‚Äôs not good to worry about things of the future. We are called to have dependence on God, rather than depending on our abilities and securities.
Dependence on God.

He said to \[his\] disciples, ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear.
23For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
24Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds!
25Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span?
26If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you anxious about the rest?
Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them.
28If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?
29As for you, do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not worry anymore.
30All the nations of the world seek for these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
31Instead, seek his kingdom, and these other things will be given you besides.
32Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
33Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.
34For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. Luke 12:22-34

I could not help but put the whole test from Luke, as it has been therapeutic each time I read it. Whenever you are stressed about the future and are not sure of what you will eat or drink or stay. Remember that God the Father feeds the birds of the air and the clothes the lilies of the field.

We are called to be rely on God alone and not on our own abilities and strengths. No matter how strong, rich, powerful or famous you may be today, it all can be taken away in a second. We need to remember that everything we have now is only a gift from God, for all good things comes from the Lord. We need not be overly concerned about storing up riches on earth, we should instead focus on storing up riches in heaven. Doing good deeds and living a good life with Jesus at the center. We should be like the 5 wise virgins who stored up extra oil, the good deeds. We should make for us bags that we can carry into heaven, something that cannot be stolen from us, it becomes an inexhaustible treasure.
But what to do when worries and anxieties knock on our door, we should pray. Pray the prayer Jesus taught us, Our Father. Just these words should be good enough to suppress all worries, for if God is our Father there is nothing we shall fear for if God is for us who can be against us. We should pray for our daily bread, and also be fed by the Eucharist every day ‚Äúthe‚Äù daily bread.

Let us know fear or worry, for each of the hairs on our head has been numbered.
Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. Luke 12:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 317 By Sheila

Luke 11:15-26.
Jesus is accused of serving and doing evil by evil's power. Yet all what Jesus does is good. Healing, curing, forgiving, giving people food, hope and good news.
Jesus warns that there will be a day of Judgment for them and we must be careful that we have not become evil ourselves. All is just fine that all is well because we believe in God.
Are we mindful of other's goodness or are we always looking for evil.

Luke 11:27-28.
While Jesus was speaking the Word of God, a woman spoke from the crowd in blessing and in truth. Blessing for the woman who gave birth and nursed You as a child. Jesus refuses, and says, NO. Rather blessed is the one who hears the Word of God and keeps it. This is more important than any blessings, any relationship of human kingship, marriage, family and parents.
He adds, we are given birth in the Word of God and we must make sure that this WORD grows within us.

### BIAY Day 317 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 11:1
*Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.‚Äù*
Prayer is not about giving God information or changing his mind.  Prayer is an activity which God wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.

By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

We usually remember John the Baptist as a baptizer who called people to repent.  But here the Bible tells us that John was a man of prayer and he also had his own disciples, some of whom, we know, followed Jesus.

Luke 11:3
*Give us this day our daily bread.*
We ask God, not only for our earthly bread but, also for our supernatural / consecrated bread, the Body of Christ (epi ousios in Greek) to keep our souls nourished as long as we live on earth.

Luke 11:4
*And forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sinned against us.*
‚ÄúForgive our offenders‚Äù does not mean that we must free them if they are in the custody of the authorities for a crime.  "Forgive our offenders" means we make a petition to God from our hearts, to forgive them, thus confirming that we have no grudge against our offenders in our hearts.  This action from us allows God's grace to flow through us to convert them.
*Lead us not into temptation / to the final test).*
God does not tempt people (James 1:13).  God allows the devil to tempt us for the purpose of testing our faith (Revelation 2:10; James 1:12), just as it was with Jesus (Matthew 4:1).

Luke 11:5-8\
Persistent prayer purifies our body (tongue) and mind (thoughts), and strengthens our soul.  We must pray continuously (1 Thessalonians 5:17), even if we have to repeat the same prayer over and over again (Matthew 26:44; Mark 14:39).  Praying repeatedly is not for the purpose of getting what we want but to purify ourselves and strengthen ourselves spiritually.

Persistent prayer is like pushing a large rock.  Our duty is to keep pushing, even if it takes days, months or years and the rock doesn't move, and even if we are criticized or mocked for our futile persistence.  God will move the rock when the time is right.

Luke 11:9-10
Jesus didn't promise us that we will receive what we *want* (material gifts) whenever we ask, search or knock.  God is not a vending machine to give us whatever material gifts we ask for. He provides us with our daily needs even if we don‚Äôt ask for it.  God is more interested in the purity of our souls and love for our neighbor to make us worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven.  Therefore Jesus wants us to focus on asking for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13) to help us so that we can use our spiritual gifts how God wants us to.

Luke 11:14-23
Let us be alert to the Beelzebuls in our lives who try to create divisions between us and our family, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.  If they can't do it with violence they may come as humble, loving, friendly people in our lives and convince us to do something ungodly against the wishes of our family members.\
Or they may want us to choose between two friends / relatives / colleagues /neighbours / etc. who are at war with each other.
If we live in obedience to God we will be able to recognize these Beelzebuls, control them and maintain our relationship with others.
Let us take the demons in our lives to Jesus so that He can cast them out by helping us to live in total obedience to God.

Jesus acknowledged that the Jews performed valid exorcisms (Luke 11:19).

Luke 11:24-26
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc.  A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don‚Äôt keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying.  We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Let us keep our focus fixed on God and continue pleasing Him in all we do and say, while we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us.

Luke 11:27-28
A woman is not blessed just because she bears children in her womb and nurses them; she is blessed only when she hears the Word of God and obeys it.
Mary was the first Christian who heard the Word of God through the Angel Gabriel and obeyed it, even before Jesus was born (Luke 1:38).\
Mary was the first Christian who accepted Jesus in her life as her God and Saviour, even before He was born (Luke 1:47).

Jesus didn‚Äôt want His mother to be blessed only because she bore Him in her womb and nursed Him.  Billions of women have borne children in their wombs and nursed them.  Instead, He blessed her for her knowledge of the scriptures and her obedience to God, even though she knew she could be stoned to death, which was the reason why He was able to come into this world and thus fulfill God‚Äôs divine plan for redemption of humanity.
Jesus was therefore blessing His own Mother for hearing the Word of God and obeying it, just as Elizabeth too had blessed her three decades earlier (Luke 1:45).

Luke 11:34-36
One example of not using our eyes positively is ‚Äúgender confusion‚Äù where the person wants to look like the opposite gender.
A person's gender reveals how that person will contribute to bring forth new life. This is the theology of the body. Therefore, when we interfere with the biology of the body we end up interfering with the theology of the body.
At best we can only reconstruct the outer appearance of a person wanting to re-assign his/her gender but no human can create the life-giving elements inside the newly modified body. They can only castrate themselves to stop production of the existing life-giving elements.
The diabolic forces don't want humans to understand the beauty of the human body and therefore they confuse humans with gender identity.
Thus, if our eyes cannot see the beauty in God‚Äôs creation then we will be living in total darkness.

Luke 11:41
*But as to what is within, give alms and everything will be clean for you.*
Almsgiving is an antidote for wickedness and greed.

Luke 12:13-15
It was a normal practice for the Jews to seek assistance from the Rabbis in the matter of disputes.
Family disputes for property and possessions arise out of greed and avarice which Jesus was preaching against.  Jesus wants people to focus on their heavenly inheritance, not their earthly inheritance.

Luke 12:16-21
6 times the rich man said "I."
4 times he said "my."
In the entire parable there is neither any thanksgiving to God for the abundance of crop nor even any mention of God.

When our hearts are filled with greed we think only about "I, me myself and mine‚Äù because we make ourselves the gods and our desire will be to please only ourselves.  We neither think about others nor do we think about God.

In today‚Äôs world we may not have barns to store up our goods but we put too much faith in our money and possessions and we believe that if we hoard sufficient wealth and possessions in this world then we are secure so we don't need God or His commandments and we don't even need to go to Church. Thus we will spend our time focusing on the less important things and miss out on what is more important for our eternal life.

God blesses us with abundance, not because He wants us to hoard the excess, but, because He wants us to share the excess with the less fortunate ones.
Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and all the rest will be given to you (Matthew 6:33).

True wealth is spiritual wealth or being rich towards God. A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
Let us therefore not waste our time slogging all day long to acquire more than what we need and thus end the day with no time and energy left for God.

Let us not forget to give thanks to God in everything.

Luke 12:31
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers.
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly (at least once or twice a year) if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God‚Äôs Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Luke 12:33-34
Anxiety about earthly things should not be the behavior of a Christian.  It is a pagan behavior.  Christians who trust in God will not be worried about earthly possessions.\
Our treasury of material wealth on earth can be lost if it is stolen or destroyed by insects or worms, but our treasury of spiritual wealth can never be stolen or destroyed because it will be guarded in Heaven by the Lord. The only possible way we can lose our spiritual wealth is if we choose to follow the devil's ways.

Luke 12:48
*From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required;*
In the new Covenant, we have been given the power of the Holy Spirit to help us keep the new law (John 15:12).  Therefore, we have no excuse to bring Heaven on earth by loving, caring for and sharing with the people around us in obedience to the new commandment (John 15:12).

Luke 12:57-59
Christians must resolve their disputes within the community with peace, love and understanding, because they belong to God‚Äôs holy Kingdom and they are supposed to follow the new Covenant law of love.  Christians must therefore not take their disputes outside the community to the pagan courts.

### The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son

[![The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day318.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uRbeK7f4QKM "The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son")

### Day 318 The real Prodigal son

We read the parable of the Lost sheep, where Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes in search of the lost sheep that tried to get away from the flock. We need to know that God is always reaching out to us and willing to come find us no matter how evil or lost we may be.

Just as the woman in the parable of the Lost Coin, God is always searching for us, doing everything (she lights a lamp, sweeps the whole house, and searches until she finds it). We need to be more open to the voice of the Lord and be aware of the different opportunities we are presented to know God.

In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, we read about the younger son who demands his share of the property. According to most customs in the world today and more so back in Jesus times, the property was only received as a gift from the parents after they passed away.
The younger son's demand for the property is highly insulting, subtly suggesting that he wishes his father would hurry up and die. He said ‚ÄúGive me the property that belongs to me‚Äù, first of all, that is a gift and a gift cannot be demanded.

This is similar to what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden, they took for themselves what they wanted. They did not wait for God to give them the gift but wanted to snatch it and become equals to God in wisdom.
I feel that the second son also falls into this category when he wants to demand and take something for himself and for his friends.
All these years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never once disobeyed your orders. Even so, you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Luke 15:29

The words ‚Äúslave‚Äù and ‚Äúorder‚Äù are not words that a son would say. The second son although always with the father has not understood his relationship with the father. He considers himself a slave and not a son.

The younger son went off to a far-off country, away from the father's care but also away from any boundaries, beliefs, or rules of the father. The elder son although physically present with the father, internally separated himself from the father's care and had a broken/misunderstood relationship with the father.

When the younger son squandered all his money on dissolute living and famine hit, he had no choice but to work for a citizen of the far of country, the job any Jew would despise, feeding the swine. As he went far from his father‚Äôs house, he stripped himself of all his spiritual practices and did things that he would have never dreamt of doing.

Most of us have been in this place in our lives, we have wasted all the blessings God has given us, and we do the worst things we can think of - go to that extent that we once never even imagined we would.

But the important part of the story is when the son came to the realization of his identity as the son and this helped him discover who his father was. He says in my father's house even the servants are treated well, he probably remembers all the years of his life, the goodness of his father.

He decides to go back to his father‚Äôs house, repent from his bad ways and be a servant in his father‚Äôs house.

The father was waiting for his son, on the lookout every day. Now it was uncommon to see an elderly Jewish father run to their children, it was usually the other way around as the elders were highly respected. God comes running to us even though we don‚Äôt deserve it, it is true. If we ask why would God who created the world even bother with a sinner like me, we have not understood the heart of God.

When the father sees the son, his poor condition. The souls of his feet must have been worn out due to the long travel barefoot, but more importantly his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù was in bad shape. He had lived a very poor spiritual life which would have caused him to feel like a slave unworthy of the father's love.

The father sees it all, he places sandals on his feet, a ring on his figure and a robe on him. He restores the son back as an heir, the sandals are a symbol of a freeman, the ring symbolizes authority as a son, and the robe symbolizes that his dignity was restored. The prodigal son is now restored back to being the son of the father.
God the Father invites each of us back, we are His children.

To the dismay of everyone, the actual prodigal son is the elder son, who lived with the father all along but did not live as a son. He considered himself a slave and demanded his rights, though he was following the orders of his father.
We may identify with the elder son, we call ourselves Christians but crib about the commandments we are called to follow. We complain about the church teachings and are intolerant to our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We get irritable when we do not get our prayers answered, we are trying to work our way up to heaven "mentality of following his orders" instead of loving his word. We are grudgingly saying ‚ÄúI followed all your orders, you did not give me a calf to celebrate with my friends.‚Äù We are envious of others and so proud that we hate to see someone do better than us, even in church circles.

We are all prodigal sons, some choose to repent and some don‚Äôt. Let us run to the arms of the Father. Who is waiting for us, searching for us, and coming after us like the good Shepherd.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 318 By Sheila

Luke 13:18-19  The Kingdom of God -  Jesus' Power and Presence in the World. It is like a mustard seed, so tiny, so as to be unnoticed. But once it is planted it can take over an entire field, just as it is meant to take over our lives and the lives of all around us. It grows to be a sheltering presence for others.

Luke 14:1, 7-11  Most of the early members of the Church were Jews. Jesus was a Jew but many in Israel did not come to believe that Jesus was the awaited Messiah because He was more than that, more than what was awaited - He was GOD. For those who believe that He is the fullness of the promises, the law and the hopes of all the years of waiting.
Now God in Jesus belongs to every tribe and Nation. But Israel is beloved of God always. They were His First people, His dearest treasure and God's gifts are irrevocable. We must be careful not to let others words influence negatively how we feel and relate to people. Our lives must reveal the Presence of God in Jesus, Crucified and Risen. We must live humbly, truthfully and with respect for all.

### BIAY Day 318 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 13:3
*No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.*
The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower, all died physical or natural death. But Jesus was talking about spiritual death.

The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower tragedy perished physically. But if we don't repent for our sins then we will perish spiritually.

Sometimes bad things may happen to us for reasons we don‚Äôt understand but best known to God, and we may have to suffer for the sins of others.  Therefore, it is always wise to repent and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that such misfortunes may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death because death can come to us anytime, anywhere.

Luke 13:6-9
The fig tree is a familiar Old Testament symbol for Israel (Jeremiah 24:1‚Äì10). As the fig tree is given one last season to produce fruit before it is cut down, so too Jesus is giving Israel one final opportunity to bear good fruits as evidence of its repentance (Luke 3:8).
It was three years since Jesus started His Ministry and He didn't see any positive changes in most of the people.
We are created by the heavenly Gardner to be producers of good fruit. But like the fig tree, if we don't produce good fruit then our end will be like that of the fig tree.
Jesus is telling us that God is patient with us and gives us plenty of time to repent and start producing good fruit.  Let us make use of that time to get closer to God do His Kingdom work.
A fig tree normally takes 3 years to produce fruits.  Inspite of constant watering and nourishment the fig tree did not produce fruits so the gardener requested for more time.
A repentant sinner is God‚Äôs prize possession therefore God will not give up on anyone who struggles to come back to Him inspite of all the spiritual nourishment, but He will not wait indefinitely.

Luke 13:10-17
Jesus deliberately healed the crippled woman on the Sabbath, not to challenge the  religious authorities of the synagogue, but to show them and everyone else that Sabbath rest was not given to humans to become slaves of the law, but to begin the day with holiness and good works of mercy, because the rest if the week they were busy with their daily duties, caring for their families and earning their living.

In the new Covenant also the Sabbath rest is given to us also for the same reason. Sabbath rest is a reminder for us of our eternal rest with God. Therefore we must spend the day with holiness by worshipping the Lord (Mass) and then focusing on good work for the community so that God can use us to help the less fortunate ones.

The religious authorities didn't see the leading of an animal to the water as work but they saw healing a helpless human as work. They valued animals and ignored the less fortunate humans when in fact they should have given priority to the needs of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and then attended to the animals.

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt give too much preference to our pets and ignore the humans in need.  Let us give priority to the needs of God‚Äôs children and then attend to our pets.

Luke 14:7-14
Jesus was not giving advise on how and with whom we must socialize.
And sitting at the lowest place is not a trick for getting promoted.\
While Jesus was literally speaking about humility of guests at a feast (Proverbs 25:6‚Äì7), He was also applying the same principle to us (the guests) at the heavenly marriage feast.

When we attend the marriage feast of the Lamb (the Mass) in Church every Sunday, we must approach the Altar, with  humility, not with pride (Sirach 3:17-20).
The Altar on earth represents the Altar in Heaven (the Body of Christ) therefore what we do on earth during worship is what we will be doing in Heaven and there is no place in Heaven for pride.

Jesus was telling the host of the feast that feeding the well-fed people is not as pleasing to God as feeding the less fortunate ones.  In other words, don‚Äôt invite those who can afford to invite you in return.
God gives us success in our material life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones.  By this we practice generosity which is very pleasing to God and our generosity must always be a one-way act.

Let us glorify the Lord by being merciful to the less fortunate ones and releasing them from bondage of poverty and suffering, remembering that we ourselves were once ransomed from bondage of sin by the price of His Blood (1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20).

Our natural human tendency is to always look for our benefits when we give alms or do some good work.  But if we get our reward in this life, then we will not get our reward from God after this life.  Our reward in this life may be in the form of publicity, favours, recognition, praise, etc.

Luke 14:26
*Whoever comes to me and does not hate Father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.*
Jesus is not asking us to despise our family members or create barriers between us and them.\
Jesus is telling us not to get attached to our family members and the pleasures of this life because if we do get attached then He will become secondary in our lives and humans and the pleasures of this life will become primary and that will give Satan the opportunity to start controlling our lives, thereby destroying our souls.
Jesus wants us to detach ourselves from the desires and pleasures of this life and make Him the ruler of our lives so that in whatever we do and say we please Jesus and not humans.

Luke 15:5
*When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.*
A shepherd keeps the strayed sheep on his shoulder because when a sheep goes astray it is helpless and frightened and therefore it doesn't move on its own even if prodded.
We too are like the sheep when we go away from God and fall into a crisis.

Luke 15:10\
*In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.*
Heaven rejoices when we make a good confession.
Just as there is great rejoicing in Heaven over every repentant sinner, there is also much sorrow in Heaven when a righteous person goes away from God.
Whenever we lose our near and dear ones or something of great value, we are filled with sorrow or grief.\
Through our feelings for the lost things or people on earth, God shows us how He feels for every soul that is lost (goes to Hell).\
Jesus gave His life for us to save us from going to Hell.  Let us, therefore, not be the cause of our Lord‚Äôs grief.

Luke 15:11-32
The Prodigal son left the place of sin and returned to his father's house. He did not buy a house in the foreign land with the intention of going back to that sinful life again during his vacation.
Repenting for our sins for convenience purpose, with the intention of going back to our sinful life, is not true repentance.

The Prodigal son abandoned his father's house, it led him into a sinful life which brought him misery, then he repented and returned and the father welcomed him with great joy.\
All these steps are the process of conversion of a sinner.

The Prodigal son was an image of Israel.
The Israelites had left their home (Canaan) to go to a far-off foreign land (Egypt). They enjoyed life for a while, then they were subject to slavery followed by difficult times in the desert but finally they reached the promised land (Israel) and were happy.
Likewise the Prodigal son is also an image of us.

This parable has a sacramental principle.
Our earthly inheritance is a shadow of our heavenly inheritance (Baptism).
In both cases the inheritance is a gift, not our right.  We don‚Äôt do anything to earn our inheritance.
Like our earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is also handed down to us by our parents, guardians or elders through baptism.  But during our lifetime we separate ourselves from our heavenly Father by blending with the pagan world and committing mortal sins, and thereby squandering our heavenly inheritance.  Thus, we become ritually unclean.  To return to our heavenly Father we must repent and confess our sins.  Thereafter our heavenly Father will renew the broken Covenant (signet ring) when we make atonement for our sins by offering the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ during Mass.

In this parable, Jesus teaches us that our heavenly Father is not looking to condemn us or to find fault with us, but rather is a Merciful Father, who is looking for our return, ready to welcome and embrace us.
Even though we may be unfaithful to Him, God is always faithful to us. Our Father wants us to have the fullness of life in Himself.

The Parable of the Prodigal Son reminds us of the emptiness of leaving God, choosing our own way. The Lord wants to restore to us what is lost.  He is the One who runs to us, looking for the least opening in our hearts, so that He can welcome us back into the family.
Each time that we return to confess our sins and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, our Father accepts us back into the fold with more love than we can imagine.
Let us always turn to our Merciful Father, as He offers His love so freely to us.

The younger son was not only feeding the unclean pigs but he also wanted to eat what they were eating,  In the Jewish world, no one could get more lower than where this young man had reached in his sinful life.  But even that son was accepted by the compassionate father when he repented.  The son had, however, repented because he had reached a point of total despair.

However much we may have enjoyed living a sinful or ungodly life when times were good, it is only when we reach that desperate ‚Äúpig pen‚Äù experience that we realize we can be truly happy only in our Father‚Äôs house (the Church).

When we hear this parable, most of us get sentimental and conclude that, inspite of the conflicts, the father and sons united and they lived happily ever after.  But Jesus doesn‚Äôt conclude with a happy ending.  Jesus doesn‚Äôt even tell us what happened in the end.  And the Pharisees didn‚Äôt really get sentimental after hearing this parable.  On the contrary, they were offended (Luke 16:14-15).  Jesus was telling them that their image of God was wrong.

The prodigal younger son already had a fight with the father some months ago and left the house after taking his share.  Upon his return, when the father threw a party in celebration, it gave rise to a new conflict.

Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.

Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.
Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.
Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.

Jesus first told the people the parable of the lost sheep where the shepherd went out and brought it back (Luke 15:3-7).\
Next he told them about the parable of the lost coin where the owner of the house started looking for the coin all over the place until she found it (Luke 15:8-10).\
In this third parable Jesus talks about a rebellious son leaving the father‚Äôs home but nobody went to bring him back.
When the younger brother left his father‚Äôs house, a really good older brother would have assured the father ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry father, I will go and look for my brother and bring him back home even if it costs me my life‚Äù.\
After dividing the property, everything the father owned was now the property of the older son.  So when the father wanted to have a feast the older son had to pay the price for everything including the robe, the ring, the shoes and the feast.  For the younger son everything was free, but to take part in the feast, he had to repent and humble himself.

We, the human race, are like the younger brother, the prodigal son.  We needed an older brother to pay the price for our sins, so that we can take part in the feast (Mass /Eucharistic meal / Communion) with our Father without paying for anything.  But to take part in the feast, we, the younger ones, have to repent and humble ourselves first so that we can be in a state of grace before sharing in the Eucharistic meal / Communion (1 Corinthians 11:27).

The prodigal brother, unfortunately, got a Pharisee for an older brother.  But we are truly blessed because for us there is a true older brother and Jesus paid that price for us at the cost of his life, to protect us from the enemy so that we could come back to the Father‚Äôs House (the Church) and take part in the marriage supper of the Lamb (Communion).
On the Cross, Jesus paid a debt he did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay.  If we understood the depth of what Jesus did for us, it would melt us, move us and change our lives completely, and we would be true Christians.

Luke 16:8
*And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly;*
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewd response to the crisis.

*The children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.*
The Steward used material goods to gain friendship but the children of light (God's people) must use spiritual goods (love, peace, prayer, etc.) or sacrifice their material goods to gain friendship.
The Steward also forgave the people what they owed the master, like the priest who forgives the sinners who owe the heavenly Master an infinite debt when they sin.
Similarly, we too must forgive our offenders in order to gain their friendship and erase all enmity.

Luke 16:19-31
Lazarus went to the righteous side of Purgatory / Sheol / Hades, and thereafter to Heaven because he had gone through suffering when he was on the earth, and the rich man went to the unrighteous side of Purgatory, and thereafter to Hell because he had not shared his abundant blessings with Lazarus.\
The rich man had committed the sin of omission.

The rich man had neither murdered Lazarus, nor had he tortured Lazarus in any way. He had not even spoken a harsh word to Lazarus, and yet he was destined for eternal damnation (Hell).

Jesus again reminds us how important it is to be generous with the less fortunate ones.  But this time He tells us how serious it is if we neglect them.

Even if we have fulfilled all our religious obligations faithfully, God is first going to check whether or not we have been merciful towards our neighbor (Matthew 25:41-43).
If there are poor, needy and oppressed people around us, specially in our community, then it only means that we are not doing our duty as Christians.

The rich man symbolizes Israel‚Äôs failure to keep the old Covenant, and to heed the commandments of Moses and the prophets. Like the rich man and Israel, we too will lose our inheritance if we fail to give to the poor and needy.

It is not wrong to be rich.  But it is wrong if we don‚Äôt use our wealth to help the less fortunate ones.
We need to be good stewards of what God has given us while we focus on our holiness.
Sins of omission are as serious as sins of commission.

Separation or exile from God is what causes the people to burn in Hell because they do not possess the sanctifying grace which gives them the power to stand in the presence of God‚Äôs glory which stretches from Heaven to Hell.  Suffering on earth due to sins is only a small demonstration of Hell.

Jesus may have deliberately used the name "Lazarus" for the poor man, but did not name the rich man, because even after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38-44; Luke 16:31), the enemies of Jesus did not want to accept Jesus as the Messiah.  Instead, they were plotting to kill Lazarus because Jesus was becoming more popular after raising Lazarus from the dead (John 12:9-11).

### Come, Follow Me

[![Come, Follow Me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day319.jpg)](https://youtu.be/coaraYWTJTM "Come, Follow Me")

### DAY 319 By Sheila

Luke 17: 11-19  The Word of God warns leaders of the World that they will be judged, not as individuals but for all the effects of their collective actions/decisions in the World. God judgments will be swift and terrible in those whose choices disobeyed the Laws of God and disregarded the care of the people and the lives of all.
Jesus heals ten lepers, all of them, all of us in our Church, Communities. He commands that we do what is necessary according to the Law, so that we can live in Society and contribute to it. But only one give thanks, only one acknowledges Jesus' Power and Goodness and Blessed God. And this person was not even a believer. Does God look at all of us (the other nine) and says, "Where Are You? "

Luke 18: 1-8    God's Word has bounded down from the Heavens in the stillness of Night and this Word is a sharp sword that brings death and new life, either decreeing freedom and life and awe before God, or death for those who stand against God's Will.
This is what happened at the Red Sea and we believe, this has happened in The Word become flesh among us in Jesus, the Lord.
We are to pray and reflect upon the Word of the Lord and let it transform us and call us to account in our own lives.
It has been so since the beginning. Would Our God find us faithful or would He find us with the unjust of the World, only occasionally doing justice because we are afraid of Orphans, Widows and the Word of God?.

#### Day 319 Religion is not just a bunch of rules

We sometimes find ourselves in a place where we have lost the true essence of our Christian life and are just trying to follow rules. Sometimes we even just go to Church so that others may think we are good. We probably have forgotten our first love for the Lord. If we feel that way then we need to renew our calling to follow Jesus.

In the Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector when they went up to the temple area to pray, the Pharisee lists out all the ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù he did for the Lord, he fasts and pays tithes and he even goes on to condemn others by saying I am not like the rest of humanity ‚Äì greedy, dishonest, adulterous or like the tax collectors. His words and actions tell us that he is self-righteous and proud, remember Pride is the deadliest sin because it tries to make us one like God.(Adam and Eve wanted to be equal with God).

We see a tax collector also come up to pray, now the tax collectors were known public sinners because they were Jews who decided to work for Rome. Tax collectors were considered traitors because their role was to extort the Jews - their own people for taxes. The taxes were so high that they put many Jews into a state of poverty. Jesus sets the tax collector as a good example as compared to the Pharisee, not because of his deeds but because of the state of his heart.

But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‚ÄòO God, be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äô
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.Luke 18:13-14

The Rich official that came to Jesus claimed that he followed all the commandments from his youth, Jesus loved him and asked him for more.
When Jesus heard this he said to him, ‚ÄúThere is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.‚Äù
But when he heard this he became quite sad, for he was very rich. Luke 18: 22-23

Our Spiritual life cannot be limited to following certain rules and doing certain good deeds. We are called to a relationship with Jesus, we are called to store up riches in heaven. We cannot separate relationship and deeds, just doing good works of charity won‚Äôt get you to heaven. Heaven does not consist of good people, but of saints. Most saints are sinners who at some point in their life discovered the call to a relationship with God and then focused only on that, all good deeds are a byproduct of being in a loving relationship with God.

‚ÄúAll saints had a past and all sinners have a future.‚Äù

The young man went away sad because he preferred to hold onto his earthly riches rather than follow Jesus.

On the contrary, we see Zacchaeus the Tax collector climb up the sycamore tree to encounter Jesus. Jesus noticed that fire in his heart to be good and even went to his house. Once anyone welcomes Jesus into their house/heart the chains are broken and one is set free.
But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúBehold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù
And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.‚Äù Luke 19: 8-10

Zaachaeus being a chief tax collector must have had to literally give away all his property because most of the money earned would have been by extortion. We see someone who was able to part with their earthly possessions to gain riches in heaven.

Jesus came for the lost and sick people in the world.

Let us not just be a rule-following, self-righteous bunch that try to work our way through goodness, but let us give it all for the sake of the Kingdom. Store up riches in heaven and more importantly listen to his voice and follow Him.
If you hear God‚Äôs call today harden not your heart.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 319 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 17:7-10
It is the same in the spiritual world.
However obedient we have been to God‚Äôs Commandments, we are still sinners or humans with damaged souls (lack of sanctifying grace).  Moreover, with every sin we commit, we incur an infinite debt which we can never pay back to an infinitely loving God for breaking the Covenant.  Therefore we must not expect God to shower us with material gifts or prosperity in this life just because we are obeying His Commandments and doing our Christian duties.

On the other hand, if we have been successful or prosperous in life, it is not because we are obeying God‚Äôs Commandments and doing our Christian duties.  We must not link the two.

This parable was initially meant for the Apostles because they were chosen to carry out God‚Äôs mission by preaching, casting out demons, performing miracles, etc.  In such cases there was a chance that they could get conceited.  But this parable also applies to all God‚Äôs people who are chosen to serve God in various ways.  Sometimes we may secretly expect some reward for doing God‚Äôs work even though we don‚Äôt mention it.  Also, more often than not, we emphasize only on our rights and not on our duties.

We have to remember always that whatever spiritual work we may be doing for the Lord, in the end He is still our Master.  This parable is therefore a reminder for all disciples to be on guard against spiritual pride and to be humble at all times as a servant is expected to be.

If we have been His obedient children and if we are doing our Christian duties, then we will receive our reward in Heaven.  Until then we must continue living our life in holiness and do our Christian duties faithfully without any expectations.

When we are baptized we enter into a Covenant with God.  Just as an Agreement involves some kind of supply or service, in God's Kingdom the Covenant involves only Kingdom service and must continue until death.

Most of the time when we go to Church to attend the marriage supper of the Lamb we just sit and wait to be served.  Jesus tells us that just because we have busied ourselves by doing work outside the Church, it should be no excuse for us to help inside the Church. When we enter the Church, God, our Master, expects us to help with some of the many works required to be done inside the Church also,.

That is kingdom work for which we must neither expect any reward on earth nor must we boast about it, because that is our obligation (1 Corinthians 9:16).

Luke 17:11-19
One leper was a Samaritan (a gentile), and the remaining nine were Jews.\
When the gentile Samaritan was healed, only he came back to thank Jesus.  God‚Äôs people took the miracle for granted and were not grateful for what they received.\
Many of us are like the Jews.  We, the people of God, receive so many blessings in our daily lives but we take them for granted as if it is God‚Äôs obligation to send us those blessings.  We fail to thank God for our daily meals, our jobs, the good health we and our family enjoy, etc. We fail to obey God‚Äôs commandments when times are good, and in times of crisis we not only fail to trust in God but we even hold God responsible for the suffering we go through due to delay in ending the crisis.
Like the Samaritan, let us remember to thank God every day for all the blessings which we receive, and above all, let us always remember to thank God for giving His Son to us in the Sacraments (Confession & Communion) so that we can have divine (supernatural) life as long as we live and forever.
This incident was a type of a mini Mass.
The lepers began by saying, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have mercy on us!‚Äù
Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests.
Then one came back glorifying God.
Then the leper fell on his knees and gave thanks (Eucharistia) to Jesus.
At the end Jesus tells the man to go on his way.

Jews and Samaritans usually never got along with each other. They were enemies.
But since the same disease had struck them The two enemies were united in their misfortune.

When life is smooth, easy going, trouble-free, comfortable, we build walls between ourselves and others in the name of caste, religion, nationality, etc. But when times are bad and we are in the same boat of disaster as others, we automatically destroy the walls which we ourselves had built.
Let us be thankful to God, not only for the blessings which we have received but also for the blessings which others have received. In this way we will be able to destroy our envy and focus our attention on being charitable towards them.

Luke 17:20-21
*‚ÄúThe kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, ‚ÄòLook, here it is!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is!‚Äô For, in fact, the kingdom of God is within you.‚Äù*
Where the king is, there his kingdom is.
If Christ is in our hearts then the kingdom of God is within us.  We must not look for signs but busy ourselves in sharing the Gospel and shining our light around us to glorify God.

The kingdom of God is Jesus in the Word, in Spirit and in flesh.
We have a long way to go from where we are today, until we reach the Kingdom of God in Heaven. But the Lord gives Himself to us in the Word (the Bible), in Spirit (through prayers) and in flesh (through the Sacrament) when we are in a state of grace, to give us a full assurance of our faith and the foretaste of the eternal life that awaits us.  In order to reach Heaven we must receive the Kingdom of God completely and we receive all these three forms of Jesus during Mass.

When the Kingdom of God is within us completely we will be filled with the sacrificial love of Christ and we will be able to radiate that love to everyone around us (John 15:9-10).

Luke 17:26-28
In the days of Noah the priorities of humans were feasting, wealth and pleasure.  They didn‚Äôt take eternal life seriously and therefore they were not prepared when the end came.

In the present time it is very clear that we are going backwards to the days of Noah and we have almost reached that stage.

In the days of Noah, those who were left behind in the Ark were saved (1 Peter 3:20) (Matthew 24:37-39).

Similarly, in the present time, those who are left behind in the Ark (the Church), will be saved.  But we can be in the Ark (the Church / the Body of Christ) only if we live our Christian lives faithfully in obedience to all of God‚Äôs commandments.

Luke 17:37
*Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhere, Lord?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúWhere the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.‚Äù*
Vultures feed on dead flesh. Those who follow Christ will have divine life when Jesus comes to take His flock at the end of time (John 6:54).

Luke 18:1-8
Like the widow, sometimes we too face oppression, opposition, injustice, etc. from godless and pitiless adversaries, but in the midst of all this Jesus wants us to continue praying with persistence and not to lose hope because God will surely send justice when the time is right and deliver us from the evil and unjust people.

Jesus used a godless judge as an analogy for God because that is the way we so often view God the Father as, when we cry to Him day and night for justice and justice is delayed.

We may not say it in so many words but by the negative way we react to our problems it is obvious that we don't really trust that God is a loving Father. We therefore put our trust in finding worldly solutions to our problems because we don't have patience. We accumulate wealth and material goods because we don't trust that God will provide. But God has His own time to answer our prayers. If our prayers are not answered then it means that we are asking for something which is against God's Will. Sometimes God may want to teach us patience and trust while we wait for His answer.

Luke 18:9-14
The Pharisee‚Äôs prayer is almost a parody of the thanksgiving psalms (Psalms 30, 118). Instead of praising God for His mighty works, the Pharisee congratulates himself for his own deeds.
On the other hand, the tax collector stands at a distance, too ashamed even to raise his eyes to God (Ezra 9:6). He prays with a humble and contrite heart (Psalm 51:19). He knows that before God no one is righteous, no one has cause to boast (Roman 3:10; 4:2).

God cannot be bribed (Deuteronomy 10:17). We cannot curry favor with Him or impress Him, even with our good deeds or our faithful observance of religious duties such as tithing and fasting.
If we try to exalt ourselves before the Lord, as the Pharisee does, we will be brought low (Luke 1:52).
This should be a warning for us, not to take pride in our piety, not to slip into the self-righteousness of thinking that we are better than others, that we are ‚Äúnot like the rest of sinful humanity.‚Äù
Let us clothe ourselves with humility (1 Peter 5:5‚Äì6), and recognize that all of us are sinners in need of His mercy (Proverbs 29:33).

Luke 18:22
It is not wrong to be rich but when God blesses us with prosperity and we don‚Äôt share our blessings with the less fortunate ones then God is very displeased.

The young man had faithfully followed all of God‚Äôs commandments but he still couldn't feel the presence of God in his life because there was one commandment he had overlooked.  He was blessed with a lot of wealth but he selfishly kept it for himself.  He did not share it with the less fortunate ones. Therefore he had blocked God from entering his life.  He wanted to surrender himself to God but he was attached to his wealth.

God gives us prosperity in life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones.  Luxury and comfort are just candy coated poison.

Luke 19:1-10
By declaring that he would return what he earned by cheating, Zacchaeus was actually confessing his sin to Jesus that he had earned his wealth by using sinful methods.
In the old Covenant, the people were commanded to confess their sins to a priest with the appropriate sin offering to make the atonement (Leviticus 5 & 6) and God would forgive them their sins.  But in the case of theft or damage to others, forgiveness was not complete and atonement could not be done until the person did the fitting restitution (Numbers 5:5-7).\
But the old Covenant was only a shadow or preparation for the new Covenant.
Jesus therefore commended Zacchaeus for making the fitting restitution.

Before offering our gifts at the Altar during Mass, we must make restitution with the one from whom we have stolen or to whom we have caused damage in any way (Matthew 5:23-26).  Thereafter we can confess our sins to the priest and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.

In cases where restitution is not possible, we must come to an agreement with the victim on how we can make satisfaction for the damage we have done.
If we are not sure how to make restitution then we can confess our sins to the priest and we will be told what we have to do.  We must follow the prescribed penance obediently.

In any case, restitution or satisfaction can be done only with humans.
When we make a Covenant with Satan (commit a mortal sin) by damaging someone in any way (goods, reputation, peace, happiness, etc.), we automatically break our Covenant with God and thereby offend God severely.  We can never make direct restitution with God.  But, before confessing our sins, when we make restitution with the humans whom we have offended, God will be pleased with our repentance.

When Zacchaeus was robbing his fellow Jews in town, many people hated him, feared him and avoided him because many were going through financial crisis of which Zacchaeus was the cause.  Thus Zacchaeus was creating ripples of badness because God was not in his heart.  His heart was filled with greed.

When Zacchaeus accepted Jesus in his heart and in his home, he was suddenly so filled with love and mercy that he ended up showing mercy to all his victims in the town by returning what he had snatched from them and thus saving them from possible disasters.

Jesus showed mercy to only one man, Zacchaeus, and through Zacchaeus a whole town of miserable victims were saved.  By accepting Jesus in his heart and in his home, Zacchaeus allowed Jesus to use him to create ripples of goodness.

We are all responsible for creating ripples of goodness or badness.
When we release a drop of goodness with our humility, we create ripples of goodness around us.
When we release a drop of badness with our pride, we create ripples of badness around us.
It all depends on what we choose to release.
But we can release ripples of goodness only when God is truly within us.  Thus we will be able to spread love, compassion, generosity, kindness, etc. Without God we only spread anger, hatred, enmity, revenge, greed, selfishness, etc. because when God is not within us we are in the power of the devil.
*Let us therefore make a wise choice in our lives by truly surrendering ourselves to the Lord so that Jesus can use us, just as He used Zacchaeus, to create ripples of goodness around us, wherever we are.  Only then we can say that God‚Äôs kingdom has come down and God‚Äôs Will is being done on earth as it is in Heaven.*

*Let God be our steering wheel and not our spare tyre.*

*The people were not happy that Jesus entered the home of a sinner and they started grumbling.*
When we invite Jesus into our lives and into our homes, the evil one will not be happy.  He will therefore stir up his disciples thereby causing us to receive a lot of negative comments from people around us.  But, like Zacchaeus, let us not be disturbed by people's negative comments.  Let us ignore those comments, pray for those people and continue serving the Lord.

On the other hand, if God has chosen someone known to us for His divine mission, let us not be like those negative people.
Jesus came to heal those who are spiritually sick, not those who are spiritually healthy.

Luke 19:26
*Jesus said, ‚Äúto everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.*
When we are baptized, God gives each one of us some talent for the work of His Kingdom on earth (the Church).\
Let us use our talents to do God's work, whether it is singing, writing, teaching, preaching, cooking, sewing, healing, etc.  We can use our talents to help the poor, the sick and the aged people, or to help the Church or to help the people around us.
If we use our God-given talents to do God's work we will be blessed abundantly.
If we bury our God-given talents by using them only for earthly glory we will lose our eternal blessings.
Let us begin with baby steps and God will give us the strength to progress into walking with confidence, and growing in our mission.

Luke 19:41-44
Jesus stood there and wept because He could see the mockery and destruction of His Body (the Temple) that would happen within the next few days, which was the advance destruction and the desecration of the Temple in 70 AD. He could see the loss of life and the atrocities against the sacred.  He could see the siege and fall of Jerusalem.

But Jesus was also weeping for us. He was weeping for the many times we would destroy His Temple (His Body) by living comfortably with our sins.

Luke 19:45-46
*Jesus Cleanses the Temple.*
Jesus was very soon going to celebrate the world‚Äôs greatest and first Day of Atonement and the first Passover of the new Covenant by offering His Body and Blood (physically and sacramentally) for the sins of the whole world. Therefore, the people of God, who make up the Temple of His Body, had to be in a state of grace before the Day of Atonement and the Passover.\
This is the same condition for the new Covenant Temple (the Church).
The old Covenant Temple was a symbol of the Body of Christ.
The wicked vendors were symbols of sin.
If God‚Äôs people are not spiritually clean before the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), then they cannot take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) because they will bring judgement on themselves.  We must therefore receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) and perform the new Day of Atonement ritual (the Penitential Rite) to purge out all the evil from our conscience so that we are in a state of grace before celebrating the new Passover and receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).

### Peter's Denial Foretold

[![Peter's Denial Foretold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day320.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E2aBWeSFZkg "Peter's Denial Foretold")

### DAY 320 By Sheila

Luke 20:27-40   when faced with reality of death, there are those who do not believe in an afterlife, in a judgment and in an reckoning of Justice for all. The Sadducees, a sect in the time of Jesus, were of this confession.
So they approached Jesus, to mock Him with an absurd case, and mocked the law of marriage as well. Jesus uses their own Scriptures to show them their ignorance and their evil intent, reminding them that GOD is the God of the Living, of their ancestors, of history and of all time.
Luke 21:5-11.  Jesus speaks of the Treasure Box. He observes, the poor widow dropping in two small coins. He says, it is all that she lives on. He continues, she is a true believer and worshipper of God. Even though she has been beggared by poverty, by the taxes of Rome and by her own religious leaders, she will give to God.
Jesus points out that He is in collusion with her!  and He wants us to be sure that we do not put others in the position she finds herself in. And yet we are to imitate her in giving all that we have to live on.... Like Jesus who gives even His Life so that we might have life.

### BIAY Day 320 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 20:9-19\
Vineyard, in the Bible, is a metaphor for God‚Äôs people (the old Israel as well as the new).
In the Old Covenant, the ‚Äúvineyard‚Äù was ‚Äúthe Temple‚Äù / ‚Äúthe congregation of Israel,‚Äù and God was ‚Äúthe Master/Land Owner of the vineyard.‚Äù\
The Temple / the congregation of Israel belonged to God.\
‚ÄúThe Master‚Äôs beloved Son‚Äù is Jesus (Mark 1:11; 9:7).
The ‚ÄúTenants‚Äù were the religious leaders.
The ‚Äúservants‚Äù were ‚Äúthe prophets‚Äù whom God sent, over the centuries, to speak to the Israelites to repent and turn back to God, but the Israelites killed them.\
Jesus was prophesying the fate of the religious leaders of Israel who refused to accept Him and what they would do to Him.

The duty of the religious leaders was to make their nation holy by doing God‚Äôs Will, but most of them were wicked.  They offended God by failing to do His Will and they crucified and killed His Son (Jesus) outside the city gates (Mount Calvary) (v. 8).\
Therefore, the priesthood of the old Covenant was destroyed in AD 70 along with the Temple building, and in the new Covenant the new priesthood was given to the new tenants (the Apostles/Bishops) (v. 9) whom Jesus ordained in the Upper Room (John 13).

The ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù are the gentiles whom the Apostles later added to the new priesthood which is now made up of mostly gentiles.  The new priesthood is now universal and must continue till the end of time.
The new vineyard is now ‚Äúthe Church‚Äù (the congregation of Christians), God is still the ‚ÄúMaster / Land Owner‚Äù of the vineyard and Jesus is still the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äôs Son.‚Äù\
The Church (the congregation of Christians) belongs to God.

This parable is a summary of the entire history of Israel.
God chose them, gave them a land and reminded them several times of their obligation to bear fruit. They eventually forgot that they were only the Stewards of the vineyard, not the owners.

God therefore allowed His vineyard to be overrun by foreign invaders, as Isaiah had foretold (Isaiah 5:1-7).
Jesus continued the story where Isaiah had left off.
We need to take care that we don‚Äôt let ourselves be overgrown with the thorns and briars of worldly anxiety.

Luke 20:27-40
Resurrected life is not a transfer of earthly life into Heaven.  It is a life of supreme communion with God.\
Marriage between man and woman is only a sign of the relation between Jesus and His bride (the Church) (Ephesians 5:23).\
Just as man and woman unite to bring forth new human life, similarly, our marriage with Jesus, when we receive the Body of Christ (Communion), in a state of grace, must cause us to go forth and evangelize the world to bring souls into the Church.

Luke 21:2-4
Our giving has more value when we share the little we have because it is more difficult to give from our poverty than it is to share from our abundance.

Luke 21:25-28
This prophecy is associated with Zechariah 14:4 (the day of the Lord) which says that the Messiah would come when the end is near.\
The purpose of this chapter is to prepare the Church for a period of distress, trials and persecutions before the second coming of Christ. The proper Christian attitude should be not to panic or to be alarmed, but to persevere in faith till the end.

Jesus was speaking of two destructions:  the Temple and the city.
The Jews believed that the Temple represented a mini universe.  The bronze sea represented the ocean, the outer curtains had stars on them, etc., but the main part of the Temple was the Holy of Holies which was the place where God dwelt.\
Therefore, the old Jerusalem was not a city.  It was a Temple with a city around it, and it was also a shadow of the new Jerusalem (the Church).
Similarly, the new Jerusalem is also not a city.  It is the Church (the holy Kingdom of God) with the world around it.  The main part of the Church is the Tabernacle which is the place where God dwells.

Therefore the period of tribulation, destruction and judgement which happened to the old Jerusalem (the Temple) and the city, locally, will happen to the new Jerusalem (the Church) and the world, globally (because the Church has parishes all over the world).

Luke 21:34-38
Let us not get carried away with feasting and drinking and the anxieties of daily life, or the end will catch us by surprise like a trap.

Luke 22:3-6
Judas was chosen so that he could forget his past habits and become a faithful disciple of Christ. But somewhere in between Judas lost his focus on discipleship and focused more on the world. By choosing to betray Jesus he was committing a mortal sin and therefore had a tragic end.

We are baptized into Jesus to be His disciples by living holy lives and to evangelize the world by sharing the Word of God.  But, like Judas, when we focus more on the pleasures and comforts of this world and lose our focus on our discipleship then, like Judas, we too are betraying Jesus and our soul may meet with a tragic end.

The chief priests bribed Judas to betray Jesus and Judas accepted the bribe to do the unlawful act of selling Jesus.
The chief priests represent those Christians who bribe others to get work done illegally, and Judas represents those Christians who accept or ask for bribes to proceed with work against the law.

Whenever we (Christians) get involved with accepting bribes, like Judas, we too are standing on Calvary and selling Jesus to the devil to be scourged and crucified.
Whenever we (Christians) get involved with giving bribes to do something unlawful, like the chief priests, we are guilty of scourging and crucifying Jesus.

Whether we give bribes or take bribes or whether we are the middle person in a bribe, in all three cases we commit a sin.  If we are guilty of being involved in a bribe in any way, we must return the bribe or give away what we received illegally and confess our sin without delay.

Luke 22:19-20
The old Covenant was always re-established only after a sacrifice was offered:
by Noah (Genesis 8:20), by Abraham, by Isaac, by Jacob, by Moses, and by David.
Similarly, the new Covenant was also established only after Jesus offered the sacramental sacrifice in the Upper Room.

Receiving absolution, after sins are forgiven, is the initial stage of Covenant renewal.
Covenant renewal is complete only after a sacrifice is offered in atonement for breaking it with our sins.

*While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples.*
After the ordinary bread is blessed by God it becomes the bread of life. The earthly bread is visible but the heavenly bread (the Body of Christ) is not, just as the human body of Jesus was visible to all but His divine body was not.

*This is my body ...........This is my blood ..........*
When Jesus said these words, the Word became living flesh, just as it did when Angel Gabriel spoke the Word of God (Luke 1:31) and Mary said ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù\
The same principle was applied in the Upper Room as it was at the incarnation.

When God speaks, His Word does not return empty.  His words accomplish what is spoken (Isaiah 55:11; Genesis 1:3).
Therefore, when Jesus said, "this is my body‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is my blood" the bread and wine became His mystical Body and Blood.

In the old Covenant, the earthly lamb was a symbol and it died after it was slaughtered, therefore it did not have the power to give the people eternal life when they received it.

In the new Covenant, by His life, death, resurrection and ascension, Jesus put the power of the Holy Spirit in the heavenly Lamb (of God) (Communion) therefore this Lamb can give us eternal life when we receive Him in a state of grace because this Lamb is still living even though He died after He was slaughtered.

*Take this and eat .......*
God does not need our sacrifice.  Therefore, He blesses it and returns it to us as the fruit of our sacrifice and a reconciliation meal so that we can have communion with Him, if we are in a state of grace.

A sacrifice offered in atonement for sins has to be a real living sacrifice, not a symbol, because our sins are real.  Thereafter, we must take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), without which the atonement process is incomplete, in other words, without which our broken relation with God cannot be repaired.  By this we become part takers in the divine nature of Christ (2 Peter 1:4), until we commit a mortal sin again.

Jesus made advance atonement for us by offering His physical Body and Blood on the Cross, once for all, so that He could give His priests His sacramental Body and Blood to make regular atonement for the sins of their congregation because without the shedding of (holy) blood there is no remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22).\
Therefore He consecrated the bread and wine in the Upper Room and commanded His priests to repeat the same action as long as they lived.  Whenever the priests consecrate the bread and wine, Jesus transforms them into His Body and Blood and offers them to God the Father in atonement for the sins of the priest and his congregation.

Although we can do penance, for hurting God with our sins, by making sacrifices in many different ways, the only sacrifice acceptable to God, in atonement for sins, is the sacrificed Body and Blood of His Son.
The first and bloody day of the old Passover was a shadow of the physical sacrifice of the Lamb of God (Jesus), and the following 7 days of feast of the unleavened bread were shadows of His sacramental sacrifice which Jesus commanded His priests to offer during Mass, the unleavened bread being a shadow of His sinless Body.
The Apostles continued doing the same as long as they lived (Acts 2:46-47) and it is the obligation of every priest to do the same as long as they live.

Mary (the new Eve) is the Ark of the Covenant and the Blood of the Covenant is the same Blood which Jesus received from His Mother and which He offered to God in atonement for our sins, to reverse the error of the first Eve.

Luke 22:25-26
*But he said to them, ‚ÄúThe kings of the gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.  But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves.*

In the pagan world the person with authority bosses over the subordinates but in God's kingdom the person with authority must serve the subordinates.\
An apostle's / bishop's duty is to serve the congregation, specially during the distribution of the sacrificial meal.

### Day 320 Peter‚Äôs denial

Let‚Äôs try to remember the last time we went to confession, we probably came out with great vigor to never commit those sins again. Or after a retreat, we come back with great zeal to tell everyone about Jesus. Likewise Peter was so full of zeal to even die for Jesus.

‚ÄúSimon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,
32but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.‚Äù
33He said to him, ‚ÄúLord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.‚Äù
34But he replied, ‚ÄúI tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.‚Äù Luke 22:31-34

However Jesus knows everything about us, He foretold Peter‚Äôs denial. Jesus knew that it was going to be a time of great trial for the disciples ‚Äì for Jesus said ‚ÄúSatan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat‚Äù.

After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.
55They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.
56When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, ‚ÄúThis man too was with him.‚Äù
57But he denied it saying, ‚ÄúWoman, I do not know him.‚Äù
58A short while later someone else saw him and said, ‚ÄúYou too are one of them‚Äù; but Peter answered, ‚ÄúMy friend, I am not.‚Äù
59About an hour later, still another insisted, ‚ÄúAssuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.‚Äù
60But Peter said, ‚ÄúMy friend, I do not know what you are talking about.‚Äù Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,
61and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, ‚ÄúBefore the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.‚Äù
62He went out and began to weep bitterly. Luke 22:54-62

Peter who promised to go to prison or even die for Jesus, is outright denying that he even knew Jesus. Peter is human and was probably afraid for his life. Imagine how sad, upset and contrite Peter must have felt as soon as Jesus looked at him when the cock crowed thrice.
Are we not like Peter, initially full of zeal, and when it comes to it, we back out and deny Jesus. The one thing that Peter did better than Judas is he repented, he felt sorry for his sins and knew the heart of Jesus. He knew that God‚Äôs love and mercy is without bounds. Jesus knows our hearts too, that we are human and will waiver in our intentions. God still loves us, no matter how bad we are or how many times we have failed. His Mercy is never-ending.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Jesus' Prayer in the Garden

[![Jesus' Prayer in the Garden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day321.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DeOqtYjaUUE "Jesus' Prayer in the Garden")

### Day 321 Where not our heart burning when He spoke to us

Oh how I wished I was Cleopas, he and his wife on the road to Emmaus had the pleasure of a long conversation with the risen Lord. Jesus probably did like a ‚ÄúBible in a year - in a day‚Äù reading the Old Testament and explaining how Jesus is the fulfillment of the old testament promises, how Jesus is the new Adam, Moses, David, Elijah‚Ä¶. I cannot even imagine how uplifted and overwhelmed they must have felt, given how downcast they were feeling after Jesus' death.

Then they said to each other, ‚ÄúWere not our hearts burning \[within us\] while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us?‚Äù Luke 24:32

At the end of the journey when they years where opened by Jesus teaching and their hearts on fire, Jesus did something that would blow their socks off ‚Äì he celebrated the Eucharist with them.

And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them.
31With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. Luke 24:31

In the breaking of the bread, Jesus revealed His true presence and divinity. After they ate this bread their eyes were opened, and they ate the fruit of the new tree of life the cross. Our first parents ate the forbidden fruit and their eyes were closed. We should not be too jealous of Cleopas and his wife as we still have the Eucharist even till this day 2000+ years later. In the Eucharist, the scriptures are read, and they are opened up to us by the priest/deacon. And in the breaking of the bread Jesus‚Äôs true presence is felt. ‚ÄúThis is my body and this is my blood‚Äù When we eat this bread our eyes are opened and we receive life, we receive nourishment, and strength for the journey to heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 321 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 22:39-46
In the 21st century we may try to look at this scene from a medical point of view, trying to figure out the scientific explanation of a human sweating blood. But when a first century Jew heard this account, his thoughts would have gone back to the beginning of creation when man was cursed to earn his living by the sweat of his brow, and the ground was cursed along with the man (Genesis 3:17-19). Therefore, with the drops of the precious Blood of Jesus falling on the cursed ground, Jesus reversed or undid the ancient curse of the fall of man, and the ground was therefore blessed once again.

Jesus allowed Himself to be crushed with pain and sorrow, starting in the Garden of Olives and ending on the new Tree of Life (the Cross) so that His grace could flow through the new Olive oil for spiritual healing and salvation of the whole world.

Luke 22:47-53
A while ago Jesus was sweating drops of blood but after uniting His Will to God's Will He was calm and totally in control of the situation even though He knew that it was the beginning of His passion.

When we surrender ourselves to God we will not be disturbed by any calamity which the devil will try to create around us, even if we have to die, because God will be with us.

Luke 22:61-62
Simon Peter's repentance was godly repentance because after he denied Jesus he looked at Jesus and then he cried bitterly (Matt. 26:75).  He was truly sorry for what he had done to Jesus.

Judas's repentance was worldly repentance because after he betrayed Jesus he looked at his coins and hanged himself (Matt. 27:3-5).  He did not look at Jesus.

Luke 23:6-12
Pilate had more power over the whole of Israel whereas even though Herod's power was limited only to Galilee, Herod didn't have the power to execute a criminal who was guilty of treason.  Herod was probably angry with Pilate because Pilate had earlier killed some Galileans without consulting him (Luke 13:1).  Therefore, to please Herod this time Pilate sent Jesus to Herod to confirm if Jesus was guilty.  Thereafter Pilate and Herod became friends because they had a common enemy (Psalm 2:2).

Luke 23:8-11
Herod was intrigued when he had earlier heard the preaching of John (the Baptist), and when he heard that Jesus was not only gathering crowds with His preaching but also performing miracles, Herod tried to see Jesus (Luke 9: 7-9) but he could not because his popularity with his people was more important for him than seeing Jesus.

Herod finally got a chance to see Jesus when Jesus came to him (v. 23:8) but Herod was not interested in listening to the Word of God or helping the innocent prisoner.  He was hoping that Jesus would entertain him with some magical signs and eventually sent Jesus away after mocking Him (v. 23:11).\
What a great opportunity Herod missed. He wanted to see Jesus so the Son of God came to him, as a prisoner, but Herod mocked Him and sent Him away because he had other priorities on his mind.

Let us not follow Herod's path. When Jesus comes to us in the form of a prisoner or even a poor, lame, mute, blind, old or sick person, let us not send Him away with mockery or look at Him as an entertainer. Let us not ignore or push Jesus away by giving importance to our earthly priorities or trying to please humans.
Let us soften our hearts and please the Lord by helping the less fortunate ones.

Luke 23:39-41
*One of the rebels who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, ‚ÄúAre you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!‚Äù*
Like most of us, the bad rebel was using Jesus as a vending machine, expecting miracles for material gain.

*But the other rebuked him, saying, ‚ÄúDo you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?  And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.‚Äù*
This man, although he was a sinner, was more interested in his eternal life.
He believed that the man hanging on the Cross was Jesus, the King, and an innocent man. This means that at some point in the previous 3 years, before he went astray, he had followed Jesus, even if it was for a short while.

Sometimes we too are like him.  We start following Jesus seriously when we have problems; after our problems are solved we continue for a while, then we start getting bored with Jesus and we turn back to our previous lifestyle and end up in deep trouble that wakes us up from our spiritual slumber.

Luke 24:30-32\
In the Garden of Eden, when Adam & Eve ate the forbidden fruit, their eyes were opened and they saw their nakedness ("nahash" in Hebrew), because they saw the Word of God through the eyes of Satan ("nahash" in Hebrew).

In Emmaus, when the disciples ate the consecrated bread (the mystical Body of the risen Christ / the Holy Eucharist), their eyes were opened and they saw Jesus through the eyes of faith, even though Jesus had vanished, because they saw the Word of God through the eyes of God (Jesus).

When we see the Word of God through the eyes of God, our eyes will be opened and we will see Jesus in the Bread of life through the eyes of faith, even though we cannot see Jesus with our physical eyes.

We will, however, be able to see the risen Christ in Heaven some day if, during our lifetime, the Word of God abides in us and we receive the Bread of life (the Holy Eucharist) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).

Luke 24:27 & 30-32
Jesus explained to the disciples how to connect the scriptures (Old Testament) with Him; how to look for shadows in the scriptures which point to Him.  Although the Jews were very thorough with the scriptures, it is doubtful that they ever understood the meaning of the scriptures, which is the reason why they were blank until Jesus explained to them how to find the shadows in the scriptures and connect them to the reality in the new Covenant.  The Old Covenant people would never have imagined how God was going to transform the Passover of the Old Covenant, which was not renewable, into the glorious Passover the New Covenant, which is now renewable.

What is remarkable is the effect it had on those disciples.  The reading of the scriptures caused the hearts of the disciples to burn and the breaking of the bread opened their eyes.
After the resurrection, Jesus celebrated the first Mass with the liturgy of the Word (Luke 24:27) and the liturgy of the Eucharist (Luke 24:30-32).
This is how Jesus wants us to celebrate the Mass in Church.

On the road to Emmaus, when the disciples heard the Word of God (Scriptures) it caused their hearts to burn, and in the breaking of the bread (Communion) their eyes were opened.

May we too have the same experience during every Mass on the road of our life till we reach our Emmaus (Heaven) to have supreme communion with the Lord.

After the disciples heard the Word of God Jesus did not go to their home un-invited, nor did He ask them if He can stay.  Jesus waited till they invited Him into their home.

Similarly, after we hear the Word of God (Gospel & Readings) Jesus waits for us to invite Him into our hearts.  We must therefore ask Jesus to stay with us so that we can have supper (Communion) with Him.

The liturgy of the Word during Mass must cause our hearts also to burn and the liturgy of the Eucharist must open our eyes because Christianity is a religion of the Word and the Word is Christ present in the scriptures as well as the Eucharist.  We cannot have one without the other.  Both must go together.

Thus, by giving Himself to us through the scriptures and then in the Eucharist, Christ does for us during Mass what He did for those disciples in Emmaus.  And like those disciples, Jesus wants us to recognize Him through the Eucharist and believe Him.\
But this is not something we can achieve on our own.  We need some help (John 16:12-14), and this help we receive from the Holy Spirit.

### The Ascension

[![The Ascension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day322.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JL09RPtp2k8 "The Ascension")

### Day 322 Restore God‚Äôs Kingdom on earth

After Jesus' crucifixion, death, and resurrection Jesus presented Himself many times to the apostles with many proofs. If this was not true, I‚Äôm sure none of them would have given up their lives for Jesus.

He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.Acts 1:3

Jesus was preparing the apostles for the biggest mission of their life to go out to the ends of the earth and preach the good news and build up the church. In order for them to be able to do this, Jesus asked them to stay and pray.

While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for ‚Äúthe promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak. for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4

Now Jesus was with them a long time ‚Äì 40 days and they must have been getting impatient so they asked him ‚ÄúLord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?‚Äù
But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.‚Äù
9When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. Acts 1: 8-9

After Jesus gave them these final instructions He Ascended into heaven. After Jesus Ascended to Heaven, the disciples dedicated their time to prayer, they stayed together in the upper room and prayed. They must have been really scared as the Romans killed their leader and could kill any of them as well. They thought Jesus would restore the kingdom by defeating the Roman Empire, however, that did not happen. Now Jesus even entrusted this big task to the disciples and they probably had big doubts in their mind. They probably had no clue about how the Holy Spirit would empower them and how they would be Jesus‚Äô witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

But they just stuck together and prayed, waiting for the Holy Spirit to empower them.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 322 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 1:6-8
The Apostles asked Jesus ‚Äúwhen‚Äù the Kingdom will be restored, and Jesus responded by telling them ‚Äúhow‚Äù the Kingdom will be restored.
The Kingdom of God, which was destroyed in the Garden of Eden, will be restored by beginning with evangelisation.

The physical Body of Christ was present in limited space and time in the first century in Israel but the ascended mystical Body of Christ can be present in multiple places at the same time and His Body includes all His flock.
The disciples wanted to know when the good times would come when they would be freed from their enemies and they would see peace in their land.
Like the disciples, sometimes we too ask the same question because we want to be free from our trouble-making enemy (Satan) and enjoy peace in our lives.
But Jesus reminds us that our duty is not to focus on the turmoil or things of this world.  Our duty is to get busy and start evangelizing the world so that Jesus can use us to bring maximum people into His Kingdom and thus bring peace in our lives.

The Kingdom of God would start in Israel but would not be limited to the territory of Israel.  It would spread out to the whole world.
It would be an invisible kingdom made up of invisible souls.

Romans 1:3
Jesus is the Son of God, descended from David according to the flesh.
Jesus redeemed the world by offering His flesh and blood in atonement for our sins, the same flesh and blood which He received from his Mother Mary.

In the Old Covenant, every first born male was pre-destined by his first born status to serve as a common priest, by offering the daily sacrifices to God, and protecting His family from evil, even to the point of death.

Jesus, the first born of Mary by flesh, has fulfilled His duty as our older brother, by becoming the sacrificial priest and protecting His siblings from the enemy (Satan). Therefore, through baptism all Christians, who obey God‚Äôs commandments, become the second born of Mary (Revelation 12:17) and thus belong to God's family.\
If Jesus is our older brother then Mary is our Mother, and that is why Jesus gave her to us (His beloved disciples) (John 19:26-27).

If Jesus is our Bridegroom then, by the law, Mary is still our Mother.
In the earthly Davidic kingdom, as the son of Joseph, Jesus was the rightful heir to the earthly throne after the death of Joseph.  Therefore, by the law, Mary was the rightful Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Likewise, in the heavenly Davidic kingdom, since Jesus is our King, Mary becomes our rightful heavenly Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Romans 1:1-7
Paul applies the term ‚Äúslave‚Äù to himself in order to express his undivided allegiance to the Lord of the Church, the Master of all including slaves and masters because ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters‚Äù faithfully (Matthew 6:24).

A first century slave was a servant who obeyed the master's instructions 100 % without any argument or excuses.\
A slave did not have the right to pick and choose which instructions of his master he would obey.  He either had to obey the instructions 100% or he had to undergo severe punishment.
A slave did not have the right to voice his/her opinion or suggestion.

It is this aspect of the slave-master relationship, rather than its degrading implications, that Paul emphasizes when he discusses Christian commitment.

Paul wants us to obey God like a slave obeys his master because God knows what is best for us, better than we do, whereas our sinful nature always craves for worldly things to satisfy the desires of our flesh.
According to Paul, faith and fidelity go together. They are inseparable.

Romans 1:7
*Called to be holy.*
Paul often refers to Christians as ‚Äúthe holy ones‚Äù or ‚Äúthe saints.‚Äù
The Israelite community was called a ‚Äúholy assembly‚Äù because they had been separated for the worship and service of the Lord (Leviticus 11:44; 23:1‚Äì44).
The Christian community regarded its members as sanctified by baptism (Romans 6:22; 15:16; 1 Corinthians 6:11; Ephesians 5:26‚Äì27).  All Christians are called to holiness (1 Corinthians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:7), that is, they are called to make their lives conform to the gift of baptism which they have already received.

### Pentecost

[![Pentecost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day323.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LtoUrd0t1Rs "Pentecost")

### Day 323 The Baptism in the Spirit

As we read about the coming of the Holy Spirit in an emporing way on Pentecost we cannot help by feel ‚ÄúI want to receive the Holy Spirit like that‚Äù. The truth is that we all have been Baptised in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit and we have received a outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Baptism. At Confirmation we also receive the Holy Spirit when the Bishop lays his hands on us and anoints our head with the Chrism oil. So why don‚Äôt we have an experience like the experience of the Apostles at Pentecost. The answer is some do and some don‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThe Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak‚Äù Mt 26:41

Some folks are prepared for confirmation and some are not, some are expecting the received power from on high and some are not. The truth is that we have already received the Holy Spirit at Baptism and at every sacrament however we are not open to the Spirit.
The Baptism in the Spirit is a spiritual opening of oneself to the working of the Holy Spirit. It involes knowing the love of God, knowing our own weakness and sins, repentance and being prayed over for the Holy Spirit. The process described above is also popularly knows in Catholic Charismatic circles as ‚ÄúLife in the Spirit seminars  - LSS‚Äù.

Just like on Pentecost after the apostles where filled with the Holy Spirit, they came out and proclaimed God‚Äôs message of salvation. We also need to hear it, repent, concisionly allow the Holy Spirit to lead us.
This will cause use to be filled with the Holy Spirit and we will inturn proclaim God‚Äôs word to the world.

What comes after the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is more important, that is living a active Christian life.

They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the communal life, to the breaking of the bread and to the prayers

Awe came upon everyone, and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.

All who believed were together and had all things in common

Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple area and to breaking bread in their homes. They ate their meals with exultation and sincerity of heart,
47praising God and enjoying favor with all the people. And every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved. Acts 2: 42-47

Thet devoted themselves to the 4 pillars of Christian community life.
Teaching of the apostles
Communal life(Fellowship)
Breaking of the break(Eucharist)
Prayers

If we ask why our parish is struggling or why our personal spirutal state is bad. We are probably missing some of the pillars of Christian community life. Most people are only trying to survive with one Mass on Sunday, I‚Äôm sorry to say this may not take you too far, you cannot say you love someone and not spend time with them.  We need to study the Word and the church teachings, we need to have a place we belong, we need to attend Mass(it‚Äôs mentioned daily breaking of the bread) we also need to dedicated our lives to prayer, praying always.
Praying in the Spirit always.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### BIAY Day 323 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 2:1-3
*When the time came for Pentecost, all the believers were gathered together in one place.  Suddenly a noise came from the sky like a strong wind blowing, and it filled the entire house in which they were all sitting.  Then they saw what looked like tongues of fire, which spread out and came to rest on each one of them.*

The Spirit is the life-giving breath of the Father, the Wisdom by which He made all things (Psalm 104:24).\
In the first creation, the Spirit came as a ‚Äúmighty wind‚Äù sweeping over the face of the earth (Genesis 1:2).\
In the new creation of Pentecost, the same Spirit again came as ‚Äúa strong, driving wind‚Äù to renew the face of the earth (Psalm 104:30).
We receive that same Spirit in the sacraments, being made a ‚Äúnew creation‚Äù in Baptism (2 Corinthians 5:17) and we drink of the same Spirit during Mass, in the Eucharist (1 Corinthians 12:12-13).

The fire which came down from Heaven and consumed the sacrifices on Solomon‚Äôs Altar was the same fire which came down from Heaven and rested on the believers in the Upper Room.  It was the flame of the Holy Spirit.

After the sacrifice, when Isaac returned to his home, his father (Abraham) sent his Helper (Eliezer) to his home town with several gifts, to find a bride for his son. When Isaac saw her (Rebecca) he loved her and took her into his mother's tent (Genesis 24:1-67).

This was a fore shadow of the New Covenant.

After the sacrifice, when Jesus returned to his home (Heaven), God the Father sent his Helper (the Holy spirit) to his home town (Jerusalem) on Pentecost Sunday, with several gifts (love, peace, joy, kindness, etc.) to find a bride (the Church) for his Son, and the Mother of Jesus was there.  Jesus loves his bride (the Church) very much.

The descent of the Holy Spirit on Mary conceived the physical Body of Christ (Luke 1:35).
The descent of the Holy Spirit on the believers, on Pentecost Sunday, conceived the mystical Body of Christ (the Church).  It is no wonder that the mother of Jesus was also among the people in the Upper Room.

Likewise, every time a person is baptized, the Holy Spirit forms mini Christs through Mary.  These mini Christs together become part of the Body of Christ but they are not yet fully formed ‚Äúin Christ.‚Äù  After baptism we still have to grow *in Christ*.

The Holy Spirit is given to us to empower us to go out and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19-20).
The Sacrament of Confirmation perpetuates the grace of Pentecost.

Pentecost was the reversal of what happened at Babel.
At Babel, the people spoke 70 different languages and were scattered into 70 nations over all the earth (Genesis 11:1-9).

At Jerusalem, on Pentecost Sunday, the people spoke different languages but they were united in Christ.  Israel's mission was to minister to all the 70 nations.
On Pentecost Sunday love united what discord had scattered.

Pentecost Sunday was also the reversal of Mount Sinai.
At Mount Sinai 3000 idolaters were killed (Exodus 32:27-28).
At Pentecost 3000 were baptized and thus received new life (Acts 2:41).

Pentecost Sunday was the fulfillment of Mount Sinai.
In the old Covenant, at Mount Sinai, the Spirit of God descended on the mountain with peals of thunder and in the form of fire (Exodus 19:18) and God‚Äôs people (the Israelites) received the first Law on tablets of stone.

In the new Covenant, on Pentecost Sunday, the Spirit of God descended on the people on the mountain with loud noise and in tongues of fire to make known His presence in a visible, powerful and supernatural way and God‚Äôs people (the believers) received the new Law (the Gospel of love) written on their hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit received through the sacrament (2 Corinthians 3:2‚Äì8; Romans 8:2), on the 50th day after the new Passover (Easter Sunday).

Acts 2:42
*They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread.*

The believers devoted themselves to the breaking of bread because they understood and believed that during the liturgical service (the Mass) Jesus transforms the bread and wine into His mystical Body and Blood (Luke 24:30-31).

They also understood and believed that, from Pentecost Sunday onwards, the Body and Blood of the Lamb of God had to be offered during the liturgical services instead of the body and blood of the earthly lambs.

‚ÄúPentecosta‚Äù in Greek means ‚Äúfiftieth‚Äù.\
In the Old Covenant, the *Festival of Weeks* or *Pentecosta* was celebrated with joy on the 50th day from the day of the *feast of the first fruits* of the wheat/barley harvest (Leviticus 23:15-16).

In the New Covenant, Pentecost was the fulfillment of the Festival of Weeks and is celebrated on the 50th day after Easter Sunday (or Resurrection Day), Jesus being the first fruit of the new harvest.

The ‚ÄúFestival of Weeks‚Äù of the old Covenant was a mandatory festival and all Jews had to celebrate the festival by attending the liturgical service only in the Jerusalem Temple to celebrate their birth as God‚Äôs chosen people in the Covenant Law given to Moses at Sinai.  It was thus designed by God to prepare the situation for Pentecost of the new Covenant, so that, fourteen hundred years later, Jews from all over the world, speaking different languages, would be gathered in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost to receive the Holy Spirit through Baptism.  The newly baptized Jewish Christians would now need a Church to worship God in their respective foreign countries of residence, so the Apostles were compelled to spread out all over the world, anointing men for the priesthood to serve God‚Äôs people.  And thus the Gospel spread to the whole world through the Jewish Christians (the Apostles), just as God had desired (Exodus 19:6).

Acts 2:15-36\
By his first sermon on Pentecost Sunday, Peter opened the door of the kingdom of Heaven for the first time with the spiritual keys given to him by Jesus (Matthew 16:19) and started God's new family in Heaven by baptizing 3,000 people on the first day (Acts 2:41).

Romans 2:5-8
When we are baptized into Christ, we must continue to do good works in Christ so that Jesus can carry out His Kingdom work through us and so that His light may shine though us (Matthew 5:16).\
If we say we have faith in Jesus then we must prove it with our ‚Äúgood works.‚Äù

The purpose of doing good works is not to earn merits. Good works play an important role in the salvation of the world. We must do good works so that on seeing our good works the non-Christians may glorify God and be drawn towards Christ so that Jesus can bring them into His Kingdom / His Body (the Church).  Good works are the visible means of bringing people into God's Kingdom.  We must therefore continue doing good works for Christ even in the midst of crisis or problems in our lives, trusting that God will take care of our souls in the event of sudden death.

We will therefore be judged according to our faith and works (Galatians 6:7-9; Matthew 5:36-37; Matthew 25:34-46; (James 2:24); etc.).  If there are no good works to be found in us, then we will have deprived many souls of salvation.

Romans 2:15
*They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness; and their conflicting thoughts will accuse or perhaps excuse them.*\
Paul was speaking of the (Moral) Law of Christ: ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù (Galatians 5:14).
We are reminded of our guilt when our thoughts accuse us, thus enabling us to repent, but when we force our thoughts to excuse us then there is no feeling of guilt and we ultimately end up with a large pile of mortal sins.

Romans 3:28
*For we hold that a person is justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law.*
The works prescribed by the Mosaic law were not effective enough to purify a person's soul.  The Mosaic law was meant to civilize a world of uncivilized people till they were sober enough to be able to receive the Body of Christ in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27).

Romans 3:31
*Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.*
The Mosaic law was not meant to be discarded.  It was meant to be upgraded and fulfilled by Jesus (Matthew 5:17).
Through the Sermon on the mount and the parables and by the way He lived His life, Jesus upgraded the Moral law (eg. Eye for an eye = give the other cheek).
By His passion, death, resurrection and Ascension, Jesus fulfilled the Religious law.

### The Name of Jesus

[![The Name of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day324.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gzwyX18njaA "The Name of Jesus")

### Day 324 Saved by grace

One of the big debates that Catholics and some protestants have is Are you saved by faith alone? The Catholic church does not believe we are saved by faith alone, although faith is necessary to be saved. Saved by Faith ‚Äúalone‚Äù is not found in the Bible.
We see Paul explaining how Abraham was not saved by circumcision but by his faith, he was justified, and he was not justified by the works he did. So let‚Äôs get it clear we cannot be saved by faith alone or by works alone. We are saved by grace, the grace that comes from the life death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
We do need faith to believe that we are saved, we also need to have works to prove that we truly have faith, for actions are a result of what we believe. But it‚Äôs not our effort not our faith alone or our works alone that justify us, it‚Äôs the blood of Christ that justifies us.

Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace\* with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have gained access \[by faith\] to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1,2

We gain access to grace through faith, so faith is needed but is not the end, its not faith alone. It‚Äôs like flying a kite, we use some effort to get but we cannot sustain it forever, we need the wind(grace) to come and fly it. Like this example we need to believe and have faith but faith alone gets us into grace by which we are saved.
We should count our afflictions and trials as a blessing as, it produces endurance, endurance produces character, proven character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. So sufferings produces love and God is love.

Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance,
4and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope
5and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us. Romans 5: 4-5

We can be assured of God‚Äôs love for us and his saving mercy because he died for us while we were still sinners. We still have a choice to just leave Christ and ignore the price He paid for us on the cross. But he still loves us.
But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

9How much more then, since we are now justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath.
10Indeed, if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, once reconciled, will we be saved by his life. Rom 5: 8-10

We can rest assured of heaven if we have faith, and our faith produces works, but both our faith and works are not enough we need to be saved and Jesus saved us, while we were still sinners He died for us. We are washed by his blood and are redeemed, when we were sinners Jesus died for us how much more now that we are reconciled and are friends of God, we are trying to live a good Christian life, I‚Äôm sure we will be saved by God, by his grace and mercy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 324 By Cynthia Dsilva

Romans 4:16
Paul referred to Abraham as "our father in faith," not because Abraham started out with deep faith at his first encounter with God, but because over the passage of time (25 years) Abraham‚Äôs faith in God became strong by journeying with God.
Abraham is the first person in the Bible to be described as a prophet (Genesis 20:7) and this is a reminder for us that God‚Äôs prophets and leaders are often far from perfect.   While the Lord delights in using imperfect instruments like us, He‚Äôs never content to stop at our brokenness.  He always has bigger plans for us than we have for ourselves; and He longs to bring us on a journey of ever-deepening trust, just as He did thousands of years ago with Abraham, our father in faith.

Romans 5:12
*Sin came into the world through one man.*

Adam was the head of the family and a type/symbol of Christ and Eve was a type/symbol of the Church.\
Adam was supposed to protect his bride from evil just as Jesus saves His bride (the Church / the Christians) from evil (Ephesians 5:23-27).  Adam had the ultimate authority and therefore, like Jesus (Luke 4:3-12), he should have made the decision to reject Satan‚Äôs offer.  His decision was the final and definitive decision, not only for his family, but, for the entire human family. It was a lofty position given to him by God.  That is why they knew they were naked only after Adam ate the fruit (Genesis 3:7).

When the Adam (man) of the family does not obey God‚Äôs commandments, does not gather his family for daily prayers, does not help his family to stay out of mortal sin, does not ensure that his family attends Mass every Sunday, and supports his bride‚Äôs evil deeds instead of correcting her, then he is inviting the devil into his domestic Eden (home).  Like the first Eve, his bride too will eventually fall into temptation (gossiping, quarrelling, disrespecting others, etc.)  and gradually the entire family will start walking on the wrong path.

Romans 5:13
*‚Ä¶.. for up to the time of the law, sin was in the world, though sin is not accounted when there is no law.*

Before the Law was given, through Moses, sin did exist in the world but the wicked ones could not be held guilty because God had not yet given His law to the people.  Therefore, people followed the natural law and did what they felt was right.

Before the incarnation of Jesus the power of evil was greater than the power of good because Adam and Eve have given damaged souls (without divine life) to all humanity, and therefore majority of the old Covenant people followed the natural law because they found it difficult to lead good lives in the midst of evil.
But from the time of the incarnation, when God touched the earth (the womb of Mary), the world has been divinized and we are able to be peaceful.  When we are baptized we receive the grace and peace of Christ which helps the people of goodwill to move towards God.

Romans 5:15-16
*And the free gift is not like the result of the one person‚Äôs sin. For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation; but the gift, after many sins, brought acquittal.*
The sin of one man (Adam) destroyed his divine life and thereby damaged his soul and brought physical and eternal death (Hell).  The consequence of Adam‚Äôs sin spread to all humanity like a contagious disease.  Therefore, except Jesus and His mother, all humans are born with damaged souls (without divine life), by default, and are therefore subject to physical and eternal death.\
But the gift of eternal life which we receive through the redemption of one man (Jesus) does not spread to humanity as Adam‚Äôs sin did.

We can receive eternal life if we have divine life within us (John 6:54) which is possible only after we enter the Church with faith in Christ, followed by baptism.  Thereafter we must receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly, with faith, follow all the teachings of Christ and obey all God‚Äôs commandments as well as the Law of the Church.

Romans 5:20
*Where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more.*
We tortured the divine Son of God and killed Him because of our sinful nature but Jesus offered the same tortured flesh and dripping Blood to God to save us because He loved us.
On Good Friday, Jesus transformed the greatest evil in human history into the greatest good for all humanity.

God permits evil in order to draw forth some greater good.

The Mosaic law did not have the power to change hearts.  Our hearts can be changed towards God only through the power of the Holy Spirit.  The Mosaic Law was powerful enough to teach but it wasn't powerful enough to save.

Sin comes to us naturally; we struggle to maintain holiness.

The old law could not give the people the power to keep the law.  It could only point out sin. Thus, it increased sin because it made clear what constituted sin.  But, through the sacraments, Jesus gives us the grace to maintain holiness and to be able to live the new law.

There is nothing to prevent human nature being raised up to something greater, even after sin.
Whenever we encounter evil, God will give us the grace to overcome it, if we live in obedience to God's commandments and remain in a state of grace at all times.

### Boldness in Faith

[![Boldness in Faith](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day325.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kl5Z78h3bNk "Boldness in Faith")

### Day 325 Boldness to proclaim

We can so vividly remember Peter‚Äôs denial. The same person who was even afraid to acknowledge he knew Jesus, is not going to prison for Jesus and does not even care about his life. He accuses the leaders, elders, and scribes of failing to recognize the Messiah. ‚ÄúIf God is for you no one can be against you‚Äù ‚Äì nothing can be done to stop Peter and his companions. Peter and the apostles were not afraid of anything, they knew they were doing God‚Äôs will and nothing was going to stop them not even death.

‚ÄúWhether it is right in the sight of God for us to obey you rather than God, you be the judges.
20It is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.‚Äù Acts 4:19
The warning did not deter Peter and the rest of the early Christian community, this in turn caused them to pray for more boldness to proclaim the good news of the Gospel.
And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and enable your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
30as you stretch forth \[your\] hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.‚Äù
31 As they prayed, the place where they were gathered shook, and they were all filled with the holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:29-31
Let us also be inspired by the early Christian community, so we are able to pray for boldness and proclaim the good news with great conviction and authority.

St Paul‚Äôs letter to the Romans is really beautiful and helps us understand the salvation economics better. We learnt in yesterdays readings that we are not saved by our faith or works alone. We are saved by grace, by Jesus life death and resurrection.
The law entered in so that transgression might increase but, where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more,
21so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What then shall we say? Shall we persist in sin that grace may abound? Of course not!
2How can we who died to sin yet live in it?
Rom 8:5:20-2, 6:1,2
Just because we are saved by grace that does not mean we can continue to sin and let grace do its job. Even though grace overflows when sin increases, that does not mean we can continue to commit sin and expect to be saved. If we do that we can be certain that we won't be saved, because sinning is being united to death. We are to put to death the old self, crucified with Christ. Our sinful body might be done away with that we might no longer be slaves to sin.
If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him‚Äù Rom 6:8
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as \[being\] dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus. Rom 6:11
We need to try our best to fight against the old self in us and to live a new life.
However everyone can attest that as hard as we try we end up committing sin. This was exactly what St Paul was experiencing.

What I do, I do not understand. For I do not do what I want, but I do what I hate.
16Now if I do what I do not want, I concur that the law is good.
17So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
18For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. The willing is ready at hand, but doing the good is not.
19For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.
20Now if \[I\] do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
21So, then, I discover the principle that when I want to do right, evil is at hand.
22For I take delight in the law of God, in my inner self,
23 but I see in my members another principle at war with the law of my mind, taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
24Miserable one that I am! Who will deliver me from this mortal body?
25Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom 7: 15-25

We will struggle with sin and wrestle the old man in our all our lives, even until the last moments. We are called to fight the good fight and run the race till the end. We should strive to live by the Spirit and rest assured that after we have done everything and failed, Jesus will save us by His grace and Mercy. Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ who saves us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Life in the Spirit

[![Life in the Spirit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day326.jpg)](https://youtu.be/t-2wtHngQwc "Life in the Spirit")

### Day 326 Life in the Spirit

One common question that we come across is ‚ÄúHow to pray?‚Äù, many people struggle with prayer and do not know how to pray. I cannot agree more with St Paul ‚Äúfor we do not know how to pray as we ought‚Äù -Rom 8:26 We more often than not need help with our prayer life, we are not sure how to pray when to pray and for what to pray?
The Holy Spirit comes to our help, teaching us to pray according to the will of the Father.
‚ÄúIn the same way, the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.
27And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God‚Äôs will. ‚Äù Rom 8:26

The Holy Spirit comes to our aid and helps us pray according to the will of God. We verbally pray for God‚Äôs will when we pray the Our Father - Thy will be done thy kingdom come. However, there are many situations and decisions that we need to take in life, praying in the Spirit will help us pray according to God‚Äôs will. Praying in the Spirit can include praying in the gift of tongues, like the disciples after Pentecost and every generation till today.
We are children of God because the Spirt of God dwells within us.
But you are not in the flesh; on the contrary, you are in the spirit, if only the Spirit of God dwells in you. Rom 8:9

We also have resurrection and eternal life because of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs dwelling in us.
If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also, through his Spirit that dwells in you.
The Spirit makes us Children of God, we are made heirs to the kingdom because the Holy Spirit joins with our human spirit to divinize us, so that we are able to become Children of God.
‚Äú For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.
15For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you received a spirit of adoption, through which we cry, ‚ÄúAbba, Father!‚Äù
16The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
17and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. ‚Äú Rom 8:14-17

It is such a privilege to be filled with the Spirit, led by the Spirit, pray in the Spirit and become Children of God. And this beautiful relationship cannot be take away from us, for nothing can separate us from the love of God. That everything we face in life is for our own good, that God can make beautiful anything even our biggest mistakes.

We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.Rom 8:28
What will separate us from the love of Christ? Will anguish, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?
36As it is written:
‚ÄúFor your sake we are being slain all the day;
we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered.‚Äù
37No, in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly through him who loved us. Rom 8:35-37

And in all things we will be more than conquer, victorious in Jesus' name.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 326 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 5:3 & 9
In lying to Peter, the Pope, Ananias and Sapphira were lying to the Holy Spirit.\
It is the same with any Pope because the Holy Spirit guides the Church through the Pope.

The Holy Spirit speaks through all Christians because each receives the anointing of the Holy Spirit through the Sacraments of initiation (Baptism, Communion, Confirmation).

However, sometimes many Christians think that the Holy Spirit is speaking through them when He is not.  That is one reason among others why Jesus gave us the Pope and the bishops in union with Him. We can receive clarity from them as to ‚Äúwhat the Spirit is saying to the Church‚Äù (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29 and 3:6, 13, 22).

Acts 5:12‚Äì16
The creative breath of Jesus united the Apostles (His Church) to His Body, and empowered them to breathe His life into a dying world, to make it a new creation.  The Apostles were therefore fulfilling this mission with powers which only God possesses, the power to forgive sins (John 20:23) and to work ‚Äúsigns and wonders,‚Äù which were the mighty works of God (Exodus 7:3; 11:10).  The Apostles were given His life, which continues in the Church‚Äôs Word and Sacraments, so that we,  who have not seen, might inherit His blessings and ‚Äúhave life in His name.‚Äù

Acts 5:38-39
*If this plan or this undertaking is of human origin, it will fail; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them and in that case you may even be found fighting against God!‚Äù*

When we see someone sharing the Word of God it is not correct for us to silence them. Jesus knows how to take care of His bride and the Holy Spirit blows where He wills, in His own way, to bring people into the Body of Christ (the Church).

On the other hand, as the audience, each one of us has a choice. If we choose to accept the preaching we can stay and if we choose to reject the preaching we can always leave.

Acts 5:41
*So the apostles left the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name (of Jesus).*

The Apostles were happy that they were fulfilling the beatitudes (Mathew 5:10-12).\
It is only when we rejoice in our suffering that we are able to unleash the power of the Holy Spirit.
Their joy was based on their faith that God would change their ‚Äúmourning into dancing‚Äù (Psalm 30:11).

Romans 8:1-4
*There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.*

By His death on the Cross, Jesus destroyed the first Adam and by His resurrection He gave us the new Religious and Moral Law (John 15:12; Galatians 5:14).  So if we follow the Law and remain in a state of grace at all times then we cannot be condemned, because the power of the sacraments makes it possible for us to live out the Law of Christ even in a negative world.

*For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do: by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and to deal with sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, so that the just requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.*

Jesus suffered and died in obedience to God the Father as an example for us to suffer to the point of death in obedience to God. This was not possible for the old Covenant people because they did not have the power of the risen Christ within them.

In the new Covenant we are able to suffer to the point of death in obedience to God because when we receive the Body of Christ (Communion) in a state of grace, during Mass, Christ dwells within us and suffers with us, until we sin again.

By our baptism we have died with Christ and we have been buried with Christ, which means that we have destroyed the desires of our flesh.  Therefore our intention now must be to live only for the desires of our spirit, which is to seek eternal life while we live on earth by living in total obedience to God.

Romans 8:12-17
The Holy Spirit bears witness for us.
According to the law of Moses, if the people had two or three witnesses for violation of the law, they had a case.
The Holy Spirit is poured into us so that Jesus can reproduce in us His divine life, not human life, and also so that Jesus can also reproduce in us His eternal love, not human love, so that our suffering and our dying can be transformed into our participation in the redemptive suffering and death of Christ.

*So then, brothers and sisters, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.  For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.*

We do not have the power to do what Christ did but when the risen Christ dwells within us, through the reception of the sacraments, He does the needful through us.

Therefore, Paul tells us that we must focus on our spiritual life and not on the desires of our flesh (material life), so that Christ can save people through us.
We must remain in a state of grace at all times so that the Spirit of God can lead us.

*We are God's children by adoption, therefore heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.*

An adopted child has a legal right to share in the inheritance of the father just as a natural child has, but the DNA of an adopted child can never be the same as the DNA of the father's natural child by blood.

Similarly, we are God's children by adoption through our Baptism. Therefore we can share in the inheritance of God the Father but our DNA can never be the same as that of Jesus, which means that, Jesus is God and always will be, but we don't become God when we go to Heaven.  By our adoption, Jesus is, and will always be, our older brother and therefore joint heirs with Him.

Romans 8:19-23\
*For creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God;  for creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope  that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.  We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now;*

Creation suffered death and decay because of man's original sin. Therefore, creation awaits restoration through the baptism of man.\
But, unfortunately, the piling of unforgiven sins of Christians have made the suffering of creation even worse than before and that is why the earth suffers natural disasters more often now than before (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, storms, cyclones, landslides, earthquakes, etc.).

*And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies.*

Although we are baptized, like creation, we too groan because of the many problems we face in our daily lives due to our sinful and weak nature.  We will be relieved of our earthly pains only after we reach Heaven.

In baptism we are buried with Christ "body and soul" but only the soul is cleansed of the stain of original sin; the body is not redeemed. The purification of our souls, however, depends on the regular reception of the sacraments through our bodies.

Our body goes through the tests in life; our soul reaps the results.
Our earthly bodies will be left behind on earth and those who go to Heaven will receive new glorified bodies at the end of time.

Romans 8:26\
*The Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.*

Praying and worshipping God must be done in supreme communion with God which is not possible for us due to the weak and damaged nature of our souls as a result of Original Sin.  The devil therefore constantly distracts us in many ways during prayer and worship.
Due to our sinful nature, when we pray we mostly ask for the wrong things.

Because of our wayward state, we are in constant need of the Holy Spirit's assistance in order to merit anything at all in the order of eternity. He has the power to restore us to the right relationship with God as well as to keep us in the right relationship with God.  Venial sins and the various disorders of the soul, which we all suffer from, make this essential.

Romans 8:28‚Äì30
*All things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.  For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn within a large family.  And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.*

Salvation is a process from our calling to our glorification and the more we are sanctified the closer we get to our salvation (Romans 13:11).

We are called to love God, to delight in His law, and to forsake every false way.  We are to conform ourselves daily ever more closely to the image of His Son.
If we do this, we can approach His altar as a pleasing sacrifice, confident that all things work for the good, that we whom He has justified will also be glorified.

All our tribulations will turn out to be mighty blessings if we truly love God by loving our neighbour, and remain focused on God and not on our problems and earthly life.

*What is "divine foreknowledge"* (v. 29)?

To know in advance.  This is a power which only God possesses (Psalm 139:1-4).  God is in complete control of everything and no one can prevent God from accomplishing His goal (Job 42:1-2).

*What is "Predestination"?*

God has already planned in advance how He is going to handle the salvation of the world inspite of our million sins to destroy God's plan, either directly or indirectly.  God's plan for salvation includes the glorification of the Saints to conform to His Son's divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), in other words, those who will be glorified will become mini Christs, therefore we must live like a mini Christ on earth (Galatians 2:20).

To save the world God wants every human to be baptized and to obey the teachings of Christ but if we choose to walk out of God‚Äôs plan then God will not force us.

Predestination does include free will to obey God but if we choose otherwise then God does not force us to obey Him (Sirach 15:14-17).  If we disobey Him, He already has a solution planned in advance to reach His goal.
Thus, those who love and obey God are predestined to be glorified according to God's plan (v. 28); those who refuse to obey Him are not included in His plan for salvation.

Are we interested in being part of God's plan for salvation or do we prefer to follow our own agendas?

Romans 8:31
*If God is for us, who can be against us?*

When God delivered the Israelites from slavery and idolatry, neither was it the end of their problems, nor was it the beginning of lifelong celebrations.  The Israelites still had to obey God's commandments after their liberation.

God will be for us, not because we are baptized but, only if we obey Him 100%, that is, if everything we do and say is according to His Will.

Romans 8:35-38
*Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Not hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword. For it is written, ‚ÄúFor your sake we are being killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.‚Äù*

Suffering does not separate us from Christ. Suffering unites us to Christ. Suffering can separate us from Christ only when we refuse to go through the suffering and we look for solutions to get rid of the suffering.

From the day we are baptized we must be willing to give up our entire life to Christ in everything we do and say, even if we have to go through suffering.  We must suffer willingly so that Christ can suffer through us to save others, and thus use us for the growth of His Kingdom on earth.

Jesus can use anyone who is willing to suffer, at any time, but even if we suffer willingly, our own sins can separate us from Christ.

Therefore, it is necessary that we must be in a state of grace at all times while we also accept our sufferings.

*Neither death nor life‚Ä¶ shall be able to separate us from the love of Christ.*

All Christians belong to the family of God through Baptism.
Our union with Christ and with the other members of the Body of Christ, does not cease at death.  Thus, we who are alive on earth can still benefit from the other members of the Body of Christ in Heaven (the saints), by asking them to pray for us, because they are still connected to us in Christ.

### Origin of the Diaconate

[![Origin of the Diaconate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day327.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sf0Mmd5lXCc "Origin of the Diaconate")

### Day 327 The role of a Deacon in the Catholic Church.

There are two types of deacons in the Catholic church, transitional deacons and permanent deacons. During the formation of priests, one of the important parts is being a transitional deacon where they spend time at a parish to have first-hand experience of ministry.
The second time type of deacons are permanent deacons, they can be either single or married men who feel the call to serve the church.

At the liturgy, deacons assists the bishop and priests. At the Mass, the deacon proclaims the Gospel, may be invited to preach the homily, and assists at the altar. The deacon may also baptize, witness and bless marriages, preside at the Liturgy of the Hours, and preside at funeral liturgies among many other duties.
The diaconate is not a new ministry but instituted in the early church. We read in the Acts of the Apostles.

At that time, as the number of disciples continued to grow, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
So the Twelve called together the community of the disciples and said, ‚ÄúIt is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve at table.
Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task,
whereas we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.‚Äù

The proposal was acceptable to the whole community, so they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit, also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
Even though the role of the deacons was the serve at tables, Stephen was an exceptional follower of Christ the Bible calls him a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit.

The diaconate was not any volunteer/temporary service but a full time /permanent role that is why we see them having an anointing.

They presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid hands on them. Acts 6:6
The deacons are not just called to do ordinary ministry but can be led by the Spirit to do great service to the church. Stephen was such a good example of going above and beyond one‚Äôs normal duties. We cannot contain the Spirit of God, or put the power of God in a box. The Lord chooses different people to do different works.
Now Stephen, filled with grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people. Acts 6:8

Certain members of the Synagogue come to debate with him and could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke, so they falsely accused before the Sanhedrin, his face was like the face of an angel and when he began to speak such wisdom poured out he was able to put together the salvation history of Israel and spoke with such convictions that they got more and more angry, their hearts were hardened to the Word of God. They decided to stone him to death, but Stephen was so filled with the Spirit that he was able to forgive them even of this sin that cost him his life. He prayed prayers like the ones Jesus‚Äô prayed on the cross.
‚ÄúLord Jesus, receive my spirit.‚Äù

60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he fell asleep. Acts 7:59,60

Thus the first Christina martyr was a deacon, Deacon Stephen. Let us pray for all our dear Deacons in the Church that they be filled with similar grace and zeal for the Kingdom.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 327 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 6:1-3
The conflict between the Hellenists and Hebrews led to a restructuring of the community that would better serve the community‚Äôs needs.

The apostles could have stopped proclaiming the Gospel and started attending to the needs of the widows OR they could have continued proclaiming the Gospel and assured the widows of their prayers for a solution.
But when God sends someone to us with a problem He expects us to get up from our comfort zone and help them practically and not just to assure them of spiritual support.  And God doesn't expect us to cancel worship with the excuse of attending to the needy.

The apostles understood this and took action to appoint deacons to attend to the needs of the widows so that the proclamation of the Gospel would continue while the widows would be taken care of.

By allowing problems in the Church, God teaches us how to move forward and how to manage the administration of His Kingdom on earth.  That is why God started His Kingdom with inexperienced people.  Their humility and dedication to serve the Lord would be the channels through which God would cause the growth of His holy Kingdom with His power.  Earthly credentials are of no use when doing God‚Äôs work.

Luke‚Äôs purpose for adding this episode is for introducing Stephen and his martyrdom which is recounted in Acts 7.

Acts 6:5-6
These 7 men were ordained to serve as deacons.  Their duty was to assist the Apostles.  They were not successors of the Apostles.
Their role was similar to the role of the Levites in the Temple.
Successors of the Apostles are called Bishops.

Romans 9:4-5
*They are Israelites, and to them belong the Sonship (adoption), the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.*

Paul has listed all the gifts which God has bestowed on the people of Israel.
This epistle was written by Paul around one or two decades after the Ascension of Jesus.  According to God's plan for salvation, the Gospel was to be preached to the Jews first and then to the gentiles (Romans 1:16).  The Jews were the people chosen to evangelize the other nations, because Israel was God‚Äôs first-born son and it was the duty of the first-born son to carry on the priestly duty of the father.  Even though Paul was called to preach to the gentiles, he always preached to the Jews first because of his concern for his kinsfolk. When the Jews refused to accept the Gospel Paul went to the gentiles.
Paul was therefore expressing sorrow about the fact that many of the Jews had still not accepted Jesus as their Messiah and Saviour, inspite of them being God's beloved people.

Although all humans are God's children in His image, through Adam (Genesis 1:26), *Sonship* is given only to the consecrated people who live and die in a Covenant relation with God because they bear the likeness of God.
When we destroy the divine life within us with a mortal sin, we retain the image of God but not His likeness.

God dwelt on earth in a special way, only with His consecrated people (the Israelites), in the *Glory cloud.*

The *covenants* were made only with Israel through Abraham and his chosen descendants.

The *old law* was given only to Israel.

Although people of other faiths also worship God in their own way, only Israel was trained on how to *worship* God the way He wants us to, that is, with a liturgical celebration, because God would choose some men from Israel and ordain them through the Messiah to perform priestly duties and offer the prescribed sacrifice to God to constantly purify God's people as long as they lived.

The *promises* of a new Covenant, a new creation and a new heart were given only to Israel. The new Covenant was made by Jesus in the Upper Room, the new creation began on the day of the Resurrection, and we receive a new heart when we are baptized.

In the journey of salvation, the *patriarchs* who were chosen from Israel were all part of the golden thread from Adam to the Messiah (Jesus). The greatest gift to mankind, the Messiah Himself, was one of their kinsfolk.

Thus, God showed His love for Israel by preparing them carefully and giving them the entire package for salvation but unfortunately they rejected God's gift.

### Stephen is Martyred

[![Stephen is Martyred](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day328.jpg)](https://youtu.be/V-X_AW4fTBI "Stephen is Martyred")

### Day 328 Do not conform yourselves to this age

The challenge that most Christians face today was faced back in the early Church. The Roman and Greek ways of life were ones of indulging in earthly pleasure and satisfying the body. St Paul exhorts us to offer up our lives as a sacrifice, pure and holy, and to be transformed by the renewal of the mind so that we do not conform to the ways of the world but instead be able to discern what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.

I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, your spiritual worship.
Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect. Rom 12:1,2

We should love the Bible and the teachings of the church, study it, and internalize it. We will gain strength and support from the Christian community around us. We are many parts yet on body and we should learn from each other and support one another on this journey.

For as in one body we have many parts, and all the parts do not have the same function,
so we, though many, are one body in Christ and individually parts of one another.
Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them: if prophecy, in proportion to the faith;
if ministry, in ministering; if one is a teacher, in teaching;
if one exhorts, in exhortation; if one contributes, in generosity; if one is over others, with diligence; if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.Rom 12:4-8

Each of us are different, some are good at teaching, some are good in generosity, and some are good in their acts of mercy. We have so many saints in the church today who have many Charisms and gifts.
We should above all accept and love all people in the Church, even if they may seen differently from us.
Few tips to remember:
Let love be sincere; hate what is evil, hold on to what is good
love one another with mutual affection; anticipate one another in showing honor
Do not grow slack in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
Rejoice in hope,
Endure in affliction
Persevere in prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones
Exercise hospitality.
Bless those who persecute, bless and do not curse them.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
Have the same regard for one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly; do not be wise in your own estimation.
Do not repay anyone evil for evil; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all.
If possible, on your part, live at peace with all.
Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good.
Roms 9:9-21

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 328 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 7:2-53
Stephen gave us a brief view of God‚Äôs spiritual family which started with Abraham in the old Covenant. He wants us to understand that God's family is not perfect.  It is filled with a lot of imperfect people, some good and some bad.

Acts 7:55-56
*But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked up intently towards Heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.*

Jesus was standing, not sitting on His throne, because He knew that Stephen would soon be killed and He was waiting to honor the first martyr of His Church.  Stephen was not afraid of death because he was filled with the Holy Spirit.

And he said, ‚ÄúBehold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.‚Äù\*

Stephen was affirming to the Sanhedrin that the prophecy which Jesus had made before them (Mark 14:62) had been fulfilled.

Acts 7:58
*Then they dragged him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.*

The Jews did not kill Jesus because they did not have the authority to execute anyone (John 18:31) and yet Saul gave the Jews permission to kill Steven.  In doing this Saul broke the Mosaic Commandment (‚Äúdo not kill‚Äù).
The congregation was attacked by Saul and his men because Rabbi Gamaliel had strictly told them not to harm the Apostles.

Saul did not kill Stephen with his own hands, but he also did not stop the people from killing.

Sometimes, like Saul, we allow others to commit crimes or do something sinful by not stopping them when we know about it, even though we have not directly contributed towards it, whether someone is planning to divorce, to bribe, to cheat, etc. or whether someone is just gossiping or insulting others, etc.
If we have such an attitude then we are equally guilty of sin as the one who directly committed it (Ezekiel 33:8-9).

Acts 7:60
*Then he knelt down and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he died.*

Stephen followed Jesus faithfully even to the point of death.  Like his Lord and Master, Stephen too petitioned God to forgive his offenders and thus showed mercy, and his petition opened the door for Jesus to convert Saul (Acts 9:3-6).  Saul was later instrumental in bringing thousands of people into the Church.
One act of mercy from Stephen brought salvation to thousands of people.

All Christians are called to do the same.  When we petition God to forgive our offenders God‚Äôs grace starts flowing and thus we open the door for Jesus to bring salvation to many.

In a Covenant relation it is the innocent who die for the sins of the wicked.  Thereafter, if the victim petitions God to forgive the culprit then, God's grace flows to save the souls of the wicked ones by transforming them.
If the innocent ones are holy, more souls will be saved. The death of Jesus, therefore, has the capacity to save the whole world because He was a sinless man petitioning God to forgive His offenders.

Romans 11:1-5
*I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.  God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?  ‚ÄúLord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.‚Äù  But what is the divine reply to him? ‚ÄúI have kept for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.‚Äù  So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.*
Just as God had already chosen His saints in the old Covenant, in advance (1 Kings 19:18), so also He has already chosen His saints in the new Covenant, in advance (Romans 11:5), those who are humble and obedient.
Let us therefore humble ourselves and obey all that Jesus has commanded us to do so that we may be counted among the chosen ones.

Romans 11:6
*But if by grace, it is no longer because of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.*
Grace is a gift from God, but if the grace demands payment or something in return, then grace is not a gift.  By default, God gives every human the grace to accept Christ.  Rejection of Christ is purely human choice.
Grace is, therefore, not the result of our works, but a gift given to all humanity for our own salvation.

Romans 11:11-15
The Gospel was meant to be preached first to the Jews and then to the gentiles (Matthew 15:24).

Paul therefore always preached first to the Jews and when they refused to accept the Gospel he went forward to preach to the gentiles.
Thus the unbelief of the Jews paved the way for the preaching of the Gospel to the gentiles and for their easier acceptance of it outside the context of Jewish culture.

Through his mission to the gentiles, Paul also hoped to fill his fellow Jews with jealousy.  Hence he hastened to fill the entire Mediterranean world with the Gospel.  Once all the gentile nations would accept the Gospel, Israel as a whole was expected to embrace it.

If Israel‚Äôs rejection of the Gospel causes the whole world to be reconciled with God, then Israel‚Äôs acceptance would be as glorious as the resurrection of the dead.

Romans 11:25-29
In God‚Äôs design, Israel‚Äôs unbelief is being used to grant the light of faith to the Gentiles. Meanwhile, Israel still remains dear to God.

Romans 12:1
Our bodies can be acceptable sacrifices to God only when we offer our bodies in a state of grace along with all our aches and pains, our sicknesses and sufferings, and this offering must be made in union with the sacrifice of Christ offered on the Altar (1 Peter 2:5).

However, if we have a sin and we make a firm commitment to receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, then, because of our good intention, we can still offer ourselves to God after making a perfect act of contrition, bearing in mind that we must receive the sacrament soonest.
The fact that we are sorry for our sins is a sign that the grace of God is present and is drawing us back to Him!  Thus, we need to cooperate with that grace, pray, and offer ourselves to God.

Romans 12:14-21
*Do good to those who hate you and pray for those who persecute you. Never take revenge. Conquer evil with good.*

Persecution can be internal or external, from our domestic congregation at home or from the official congregation of the Church, from Christians or from non-Christians.
Persecution can be physical or spiritual.
When we choose to follow Christ, we may be strongly opposed or lured into changing our path.

It is not in our power not to feel or to forget the pain caused to us by an offense; but the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit turns injury into compassion and purifies the memory in transforming the hurt into intercession (CCC 2843).
Because when we pray for our offenders the Holy Spirit transforms our pain into intercession.

When someone attacks us, if we pray only for the safety of our families including ourselves, then we are being selfish because we are asking God to protect us while the evil ones are still running loose attacking other innocent people.
Whereas, if we pray for the conversion of our offenders and they change themselves, then the source of the chaos will be tackled and healed and there will be peace around us.

HAPPY FEAST:
Solemnity of Christ the King!

Here‚Äôs a beautiful reflection about the feast and its relevance to our daily life:

‚ÄúCome then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,
and bring us with your saints to glory everlasting.‚Äù#divinereadings

### Day 329 Gifts of the Spirit are not on sale

A man named Simon used to practice magic in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.

10All of them, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him, saying, ‚ÄúThis man is the ‚ÄòPower of God‚Äô that is called ‚ÄòGreat.‚Äô‚Äù
11They paid attention to him because he had astounded them by his magic for a long time,
12but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike were baptized.
13Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds that were occurring, he was astounded.
14Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
15who went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Spirit,
16for it had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17Then they laid hands on them and they received the holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of the apostles‚Äô hands, he offered them money
19and said, ‚ÄúGive me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit.‚Äù
20But Peter said to him, ‚ÄúMay your money perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.
21You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.

We read about Simon the magician who wanted to receive the Holy Spirit and the gifts for his personal gain. He was ready to buy the gifts so that he could use them as he wished. We cannot buy the Holy Spirit or Salvation or anything spiritual. It is a free gift, although it‚Äôs free it was not cheap, the price was Jesus‚Äô death on the cross. We can never get anything from God by paying money, or just doing charity. We have to remember that we cannot earn God‚Äôs love or Mercy we can only receive it as a free gift from God.

The gifts of the Spirit are to build us up and for the common good of the church not for profit or gain.

Also we cannot say that we will be saved on our own by reading the scriptures and praying in our house, we need the Christian community. Like the Ethiopian eunuch, who was reading the scripture and not understanding it.

‚ÄúHow can I, unless someone instructs me?‚Äù Acts 8: 31

We have great resources in the church that can help us learn about our faith and grow in holiness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 329 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 8:1-3
*That day a severe persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.  Meanwhile, Saul was trying to destroy the Church by entering house after house, dragging out the believers, both men and women, and handing them over for imprisonment.*

God makes all things work together for good for those who love God, and are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).
The persecution scattered the Christians throughout the countryside and they started preaching the Gospel to the people there.

Consecration into God's family is an obligation to obey God's Word and to spread the Word of God (Matthew 28:19-20).

It is therefore the obligation of every Christian to evangelize the non-Christians or to help other Christians to know more about the faith or to re-evangelize the fallen away Christians, specially those who they are connected with.  But when we become comfortable in our nests and neglect the kingdom work, God may allow a persecution or some calamity in the neighborhood, to drive us out of our comfort zone by force so that we move out and start working for the growth of His kingdom.  God doesn't want us to go on lamenting over our trials and tribulations and even persecutions.  He wants us to take the opportunity and go out and continue our mission with the gifts / talents which He has invested in us.

In the old Covenant, God allowed the 10 tribes to be dispersed like seeds for the same reason as well as for it to be a punishment for their sins (2 Kings 17:22-23).  It was God's Will from the time His people were consecrated that they must obey Him and be a kingdom of priests to spread the Word of God (Exodus 19:5-6).

Acts 8:14-17\
*When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.  When they arrived, they prayed for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for it had not yet come down upon any of them because they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  Then Peter and John laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.*

By laying their hands on the people to receive the Holy Spirit, Peter and John conferred the Sacrament of Confirmation.  Peter and John had to be sent to Samaria to confer this Sacrament because the authority to lay hands on the people, to receive this Sacrament, was given only to the Bishops/Apostles, and Philip was not a Bishop/Apostle; he was a Deacon.

Baptism brings people into the new Covenant and thus makes them children of God‚Äôs family, thereby permitting them to take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) of the new Passover (Mass), just as circumcision did for the people in the old Covenant (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:43-48).  The Holy Spirit is, however, conferred upon the baptized ones separately; in the case of infant Baptism the Holy Spirit is conferred on the children between the ages of 15 and 17, and in the case of adults it is conferred on them soon after Baptism.  Therefore, Peter and John were sent to Samaria to do the needful soon after the people were baptized.

Through this sacrament the Holy Spirit gives us charismatic grace to assist us in doing Kingdom work for which we have to give an account to God.  When we don‚Äôt take part in any work for God‚Äôs Kingdom, we start creating a brick wall between ourselves and the Holy Spirit.

Acts 8:24
*Simon answered, ‚ÄúPray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.‚Äù*
Simon the magician believed in the power of the Pope.
Simon was afraid when he heard the curse from Peter because by this time he may have heard of what happened to Ananias and Sapphira for grieving the Holy Spirit by lying to Peter, an anointed man of God.

Acts 8:26-38
The eunuch may have been a God-fearing man but because of the Jewish law (Deut. 23:2) he could not become a full member of the Temple (to enter the inner court).
In fulfillment of the old prophecy (Isaiah 56:3-7) the Holy Spirit was beginning to guide the Apostles and their deacons to open the doors of the Church to all people by guiding Deacon Philip to evangelize and baptize the eunuch.  Thus, the eunuch would have been the first Christian to take the Gospel to Ethiopia and talk to others about it.

Acts 8:30-31
*Philip asked, ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are reading?‚Äù The eunuch replied, ‚ÄúHow can I understand unless I have a teacher to teach me?"*
If we try interpreting the Word of God on our own we will end up in a disaster like Adam and Eve.  It is always advisable to learn the Word of God under the guidance of the right teachers, so that we build a family atmosphere, just as we learnt our basic skills from our parents, teachers, elders, etc., during our childhood.

Romans 13:1
When majority of the Christians live in disobedience to God, the world does not get sanctified and therefore God is not glorified.  Jesus commanded us to evangelize the pagan world but when we ignore, neglect or disobey this command the culture becomes corrupt and we get our leaders (religious and political) from this same culture.
But whether we have good government or bad government, we still have to obey them in all things except sin.

Romans 13:12-14
*Let us lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.  Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.*
Voluntary and intentional drunkenness is a mortal sin because it is a voluntary abandonment of the use of reason.  It is an act that belongs to the dark world and, according to Paul, those who are addicted to it will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
"Desires of the flesh" are desires of the fallen nature of our human body due to the damaged nature of our souls.

*Put on the armour of Light.*
An armour is used only when people go into battle to fight the enemy. Paul uses this analogy to remind us that we are constantly fighting a spiritual battle with the devils and demons therefore we need the armour of Christ with us always or else we will never know whether we are in God's camp or in the enemy's camp. The enemy sometimes gets violent but most of the time he succeeds in taking us into his camp smoothly and in a friendly manner.  From the time we are baptized we must live our lives like Jesus did because it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us (Galatians 2:20).

We can put on the armour of Light every morning after we wake up by starting the day with prayer and meditation on the life of Christ. While we wake up every morning to the natural light of dawn let us also wake up to the supernatural light of Christ.

### Saul's Conversion

[![Saul's Conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day330.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HOhsUfunEuM "Saul's Conversion")

### Day 330 The worst sinners make the best saints.

Saul was a young devout Jew, who witnessed the start of the persecution when Deacon Stephen was Martyred by stoning. Paul consented to the execution of Stephen.
The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. Acts 7:58

Now Saul was consenting to his execution. Acts 8:1

Soon after the execution of Stephen on that day, severe persecution caused the church to scatter.
Saul was a zealous Jew and was thinking he was doing God‚Äôs when we went about persecuting the Christians.

Now Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that, if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way, he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.
3On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.
4He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù
5He said, ‚ÄúWho are you, sir?‚Äù The reply came, ‚ÄúI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
6Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.‚Äù
7The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, for they heard the voice but could see no one.
8Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.
9For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank. Acts 9:1-9

Saul‚Äôs conversion account is so striking and dramatic that it seems unreal. Even though Saul did not crucify Jesus, Jesus said ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù. Later on in his letters, Paul will tell us the Jesus is the head and we are his body. What God started at Damascus will impact the early church and the future church ‚Äì ‚Äúus‚Äù in such a great way. Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and helped build most of the early church doctrine and letters. The zeal that Saul showed towards his religion was something that Jesus probably admired. Paul would use that same zeal to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ later.

We should not undermine anyone, no matter how evil they may seem. We do not know their full story yet, God is still working on them. In an instance God can change their hearts and their lives can be amended. Let us continue to pray for them with great fervor.

We know the rest of the story, Ananias was instructed in a vision to go and pray over Saul, was initially reluctant because of Saul‚Äôs persecutor image. Nothing stopped Saul from being baptized. After which nothing stopped him from preaching Christ, he was given such great revelation and such great zeal for the kingdom that no one could stop him.
So let us pray for all the Sauls in our lives that they may be converted to Paul. That they see the real calling in their life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Peter Preaches to the Gentiles

[![Peter Preaches to the Gentiles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day331.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xUHaQlJOiLY "Peter Preaches to the Gentiles")

### Day 331 Proclaiming God‚Äôs Word is accompanied by signs and wonders.

While St Peter was praying he was instructed in a vision that all meats are clean to eat, as he was trying to interpret the vision, the messengers of the Roman centurion Cornelius invited him to go to visit them. Usually, the Jews did not associate with pagans, but led by the Spirit Peter went up to Caesarea(a place of a lot of pagan worship) and visited Cornelius. Cornelius was earlier visited by an angel who instructed him to invite Peter, Cornelius and the other Jews that were gathered there fell down and wanted to worship Peter.

Peter started to proclaim Jesus Christ to the Romans and they believed his teaching.
While Peter was still speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word.

45The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also,
46for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded,
47‚ÄúCan anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?‚Äù Acts 10:44-47

We see that as God‚Äôs word was proclaimed it was accompanied by the great sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit. They also started praying in tongues and glorifying God. Nothing was hidden anymore, Peter was able to see clearly what he seen in the vision, that God made everything and everyone equal that there is no restrictions for anyone to become Christian. Jews and Gentiles alike both need Jesus to be saved.
We see a similar theme in the letter St Paul wrote to the church in Corinth.

When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the mystery of God, I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
2For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
4and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive (words of) wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
5so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God. 1 Cor 2:1-5

Paul did not convince people with his good education and preaching skills. He proclaimed the mystery of God with signs and wonders with a demonstration of the spirit and power. If our faith is based only on human teaching and wisdom, we may not stand strong when trials and temptations come our way. There should be signs and wonders when the Word of God is proclaimed, there should be lives changed and hearts touched by the presence of the Holy Spirit. If the preaching is only head knowledge then we may not get too far, we have to interiorize it and let is work on our hearts.
For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with the wisdom of human eloquence, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its meaning. 1 Cor 1:18
If we are only preaching with human eloquence then we might just be emptying the cross of its meaning. Let us who are preachers be very careful in listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, who will bring to our mind the correct verse or teaching that we should speak.
Let us not limit the working of the Holy Spirit.

‚ÄúWhat eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart, what God has prepared for those who love him, this God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.‚Äù 1 Cor 2:9,10

The Holy Spirit is our teacher and helper who will guide us to see the great banquet that God has prepared for us in heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 331 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 10:9-28
The dietary laws of clean and unclean animals were given to the Jews as a daily reminder to be followed until the Jews and Gentiles would become one body in Christ. The dietary laws were not meant to purify their souls.\
The Jewish men were God's first born sons because they were chosen to evangelize the world. The Jews were circumcised to belong to God's family.  The gentiles did not belong to God's family because they were not consecrated.  If the gentiles would be baptized, then they would be able to share the Body of Christ (Communion) with the Jewish Christians.\
The dietary laws were therefore a temporary sign only to set the Jews apart from the Gentiles (Mathew 15:17-20; Colossians 2:16-17).

Acts 10:39
*Peter said, ‚ÄúWe are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.‚Äù*
We are the children of the apostolic witnesses. That is why we still gather on the first day of every week (Sunday) to celebrate the feast of the Resurrection, giving thanks to God for ‚ÄúChrist, who is our life‚Äù (Colossians 3:4).

We live in memory of the Apostles‚Äô witness, like them eating and drinking with the risen Lord at the Altar. And we wait in hope for what they told us would come - the day when we too will ‚Äúappear with Him in glory.‚Äù

The apostolic testimony was not restricted only to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of these words and deeds of Jesus was to be made clear to the developing Christian community as the bearer of the Word of salvation (Acts 1:21‚Äì22).

Acts 10:40
*Peter said, ‚ÄúThen God raised him on the third day.‚Äù*
Peter said that God raised Jesus on the third day, but Jesus said that He had the power to take up His life after His death because He had received this command from His Father (John 10:18).

When we consider the human nature of Jesus, his body needed to be raised from the dead by a power outside of itself.  Even a perfect human nature (incorruptible or holy) cannot raise itself from the dead (Acts 13:37).

Therefore, the Spirit of Christ raised the Body of Christ from the dead, the Spirit being divine, because Jesus is fully God as well as fully human.\
That is why Jesus said, "destroy this temple (of His body) and *I will raise it up* on the third day‚Äù (John 2:19).

Since God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit work together in unity, it is fitting to say that ‚ÄúGod raised Jesus from the dead.‚Äù

Acts 10:44-48
*While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.*
This second Pentecost was the gentile Pentecost.
Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit before they were baptized.  Although in the normal order the Holy Spirit is received after baptism, God can change the order as He wills when a person has strong desire to follow Christ.  In Catholic theology this is known as ‚Äúreceiving the grace of the sacrament through desire.‚Äù\
Therefore, a person can and will, in certain circumstances, often known to God alone, receive the grace of the sacrament of baptism before receiving the actual sacrament, as also in the case of Apollos (Acts 18:24-25).

The response of Cornelius was a sign that grace was efficaciously working in his life even before he was baptized / purified since God freely gives every human the grace to have faith in Christ, to repent and to be baptized (Ephesians 2:8) because God desires that every human should be saved.

1 Corinthians 1:10-17
The Corinthians had created factions in the Church in the name of Paul, Apollos and Cephas (Peter), depending on who baptized them, and they were also quarrelling with each other due to these factions.

Paul wasn‚Äôt called by God to focus on baptism.  Like any other preacher, Paul too was called to preach the Gospel to introduce Christ and the Cross to the people so that they may have faith in Christ.  If the people accepted Christ then they would be baptized but it is more important for the non-believers to first believe in Christ.

Divisions in the Church (the heavenly Jerusalem) existed since the beginning of the Church but that is against what was desired by God.  Jesus prayed that the Church may be one (John 17:11 & 20-21).

Divisions in the Church are a repetition of what happened at Babel.

Division of God‚Äôs Kingdom is the work of the devil who used the pride of the rulers to cause them to disobey God and thereby divide the earthly Jerusalem (Israel) into the northern and southern kingdoms.

The Corinthian congregation was also falling prey to the same trick of the devil.
Let us pray that we do not fall prey to the same trick by following those who create divisions in the Church.

1 Corinthians 1:22
*For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom......*
Most Jews saw the Crucifixion of Jesus as a helpless and weak man dying on the Cross.  Therefore, they were not convinced that Jesus was the Messiah because He didn‚Äôt look like He was capable of leading a nation.
According to the Greeks, Jesus was crucified because He did not have the wisdom to argue His case and defend Himself and the idea of resurrection was not logical because they did not believe in resurrection of the body.

Worldly wisdom is what the people of the world employ to escape suffering and punishment.
Godly wisdom is what the people of God employ to go through suffering and punishment.

1 Corinthians 1:31
*‚ÄúWhoever boasts, should boast in the Lord.‚Äù*
‚ÄúBoasting about ourselves or our achievements‚Äù is a claim that we live and are saved by our own resources.
‚ÄúBoasting in the Lord‚Äù on the other hand, is the acknowledgment that we live only from God and for God.

1 Corinthians 2:4-5
*My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.*
Our faith must be built on the power of Jesus, not on the priests or any spiritual leaders.  They are all human messengers of Christ and therefore likely to fall.

### Barnabas and Paul's Mission

[![Barnabas and Paul's Mission](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day332.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VdicF4xF3pQ "Barnabas and Paul's Mission")

### Day 332 Do you not know ‚Äì you are the temple of God.

Many people search for God in many places and through many experiences. We can sometimes fail to overlook the dwelling of God in our hearts.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone destroys God‚Äôs temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy. 1 Cor 3:16-17

The Holy Spirit has been poured into our hearts and we are filled with the love of God. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and God dwells in us. We should not abuse or destroy our bodies because we are God‚Äôs holy temple. Many sins like excessive drinking, eating, smoking, starving and the like are sins against the body which is the temple of God.

Given that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we must not fail to recognize that other people‚Äôs bodies are also the temple of the Holy Spirit. This helps us respect other people's bodies, knowing that God dwells in them. This is the reason why we should not verbally or physically abuse anyone, because everyone is a creation of God and they are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

We cannot submit any of our body parts to evil activity as the whole body belongs to Christ.
Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.
13And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness. Rom 6:12-13

Let not sin reign in your bodies but let us use our bodies for the sake of the kingdom. Let us use all the strength that we have to serve the Lord and the serve the poor. We should use our bodies as weapons for righteousness. Dress modestly and give glory to God, let people see us, and glorify the Lord. We are all created beautiful so let us not fail to smile.

" Let the smile on our faces reflect the presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. " - Michael Eltham

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 332 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 11:1-18
Admitting a Gentile into the Church with the Jews was going to cause a huge scandal.  But the Holy Spirit chose Peter, the Pope / Vicar of Christ, to do the needful because, as commanded by Jesus, all must obey the one who sits in the Seat of Moses (Mathew 23:2-3), which was now given to Peter (Mathew 16:18).

Peter was chosen by Jesus to be the prince of the apostles and the first leader of the Church, but he too had difficulty understanding the plan of God.  He had to learn everything step by step, as from kindergarten to graduation.  God had to show Peter the vision three times for him to finally understand what God was trying to tell him. Jesus was teaching him the spiritual symbolism of unclean animals through examples just as He spoke to them in parables when He was on the earth with them.

The transition from old Covenant to new Covenant was not easy for the apostles because nothing was given to them in detail, either orally or in writing.\
The Church grew purely through the power of the Holy Spirit working in the Apostles and the early Christians.

1 Corinthians 3:1-9
To be ‚Äúof the flesh" means we have still not overcome our physical appetites for the comfort and pleasures of our earthly life.

Like the Corinthians, many of us too get involved in discussing and quarrelling about earthly matters.  That is because we have not asked the Holy Spirit help us overcome our earthly concerns, and to guide and lead us towards spiritual concerns.
When we are in the flesh our pride rules our life, and therefore we look at life from a human perspective which does not take into account the divine perspective and the Will of the Lord.

The Corinthian Christians were creating factions within God's family (the Church) and quarrelling with each other, much like the factions which we create within our earthly families, within our communities, within our countries and in the world.

Let us take a look at our lives and check whether we are ruled by pride or by humility.  Are we looking at life from a human perspective or from the divine perspective?
To make an honest check of ourselves and look at life from the divine perspective we need to spend some alone time with the Lord in silence, like Jesus (Matthew 14:23; Mark 1:35).

1 Corinthians 3:5-7
*Paul said "what is Paul? What is Apollo's? I planted, Apollo's watered but God was causing the growth. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything."*
Bringing others to Christ is not about us or what we have done.  We may sow the seeds of the Gospel by evangelizing, and we may water these seeds with prayer and fasting, and helping the people nourish their spiritual lives, but it can only take root if the person is willing to co-operate with God‚Äôs grace.  We are not the ones who convert anyone.  It is God who converts people.  God alone, who makes the Church grow in His likeness, is everything, and therefore He alone deserves all the glory.

If we have been instrumental in bringing people to the Church or close to God, we must ensure that we don't encourage others to give us praise or rewards.

Meanwhile, God can cause the growth of the Church only if we sow the seeds.  If we are not doing what we are called to do then we are depriving many souls of eternal life therefore we will be culpable.

When God gives us a task He provides workforce, resources, etc. for getting the task accomplished.  But God‚Äôs call to serve Him as co-workers is not only to a selected few; it is a call to all believers in Christ.  The preaching and spreading of the Gospel is also the responsibility of all believers.  We are all co-workers with Christ, and when we are committed to expanding the Kingdom of God on earth, *NOTHING* should hinder us from rendering undisturbed service to God.

1 Corinthians 3:15
*If the work is burned up, the builder will suffer loss; the builder will be saved, but only as through fire.*
Those who die in a state of venial sin will be gathered in Purgatory, and all those who make it to Purgatory will be saved.  But during the purification process the works done during their lifetime will be evaluated (v.11-15).
Works that were built on the foundation of Christ, akin to ‚Äúgold, silver, and precious stones‚Äù, will survive and the person will be rewarded greatly.  These are works done in Christ with pure motives.

But works that are analogous to ‚Äúwood, hay, and stubble‚Äù will be burned up.  These are the venial sins or good works done with impure motives, such as helping the poor and needy for personal gain or glory.

The ‚Äúloss‚Äù suffered is a loss of greater reward.  Salvation is, however, assured, but the level of glory will be less for the one whose ‚Äúwork is partially burned up.‚Äù  In order to go to heaven, some of his works will have to be accepted (unless he died before the age of accountability). But since some of his works are ‚Äúburned up‚Äù he will not receive as great a reward as he would have received if all his works would have been accepted.

1 Corinthians 3:16-17\
*Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?  If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person, for God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.*
God‚Äôs Spirit (divine life) is given to us when we are baptized (Matthew 28:19).  But when we commit a mortal sin, we destroy the divine life within us (Genesis 2:17), thereby destroying God‚Äôs temple.  We can, however, restore that divine life only after we receive the Body of Christ (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27).

If we die with a mortal sin we will not have divine life within us, thereby destroying our soul (God‚Äôs temple) forever.

Knowing the weakness of our souls, God has given us the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.  We must therefore be alert to sin at all times, live our lives according to God's Will and receive the sacraments regularly because the evil one is active 24/7 waiting to drag all Christians into his kingdom in many different ways.

1 Corinthians 4:1
\*Thus should one regard us: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.‚Äù
Jesus gave His apostles the authority to dispense the mysteries of God (sacraments).

### Peter Is Rescued from Prison

[![Peter Is Rescued from Prison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day333.jpg)](https://youtu.be/af9gHylLIoM "Peter Is Rescued from Prison")

### Day 333 The resurrection of the body

We sometimes tend to think that only our souls go to heaven, our bodies decay and are gone in the earth. However, scripture and tradition help us understand that we will be resurrected both body and soul.

‚ÄúThe body, however, is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body;
God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.‚Äù 1 Cor 6:13,14

God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead established itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the whole man, soul and body. CCC 992

St Paul urges us to avoid all sins against the body, especially sexual immorality.

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take Christ‚Äôs members and make them the members of a prostitute? Of course not!
16\[Or\] do you not know that anyone who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For ‚Äúthe two,‚Äù it says, ‚Äúwill become one flesh.‚Äù 1 Cor 6:15-16

We cannot indulge in any form of sexual immorality, whether it be prostitution or even lust of the eyes. When we give into these sins we are uniting ourselves to the evil in the world.
We are called to be united to Christ, one spirit with him.

But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
18Avoid immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:17,18

The one who commits sexual immoral sins, commits these sins against his/her own body. These sins can become very addictive and can weaken the conscience. These sins are mortal sins and can send us to hell if they are not forgiven.

Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor 6:9

Let us repent from all of these sins listed above, least we are denied entry into heaven. Let us not take these sins lightly, they are grave sins. We should keep our body holy as we are united with Christ. Our bodies will also be resurrected to heaven so let‚Äôs keep our body holy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
