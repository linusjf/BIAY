### Wisdom is Beautiful

[![Wisdom is Beautiful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day306.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Bx7Kp2AnF_M "Wisdom is Beautiful")

### Day 306 Wisdom defined

The word wisdom is understood as the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise. Someone could have wisdom about certain topics. However, the wisdom spoken about in the book of wisdom has a very deep meaning

For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,
23unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
24For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.
25 For she is a breath of the might of God. Wisdom 7:22-27

I seems like wisdom seems to be giving us a small sample of the nature of God. For wisdom is defined as holy, all-powerful, all-seeing which are also attributes of God.
So when we read the book of wisdom we should admire the deeper meaning when the author refers to wisdom.
We should take some time to sit down and pray ‚Äì possibly ponder of each of the below attributes of wisdom.

01. Spirit
02. Intelligent
03. Holy
04. Unique
05. Manifold
06. Subtle
07. Agile
08. Clear
09. Unstained
10. Certain
11. Never harmful
12. Loving the good
13. Keen
14. Unhampered
15. Beneficent
16. Kindly
17. Firm
18. Secure
19. Tranquil
20. all-powerful
21. all-seeing
22. pervading all spirits
23. Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion
24. penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity
25. breath of the might of God

As we ponder on these 25 attributes let us remember that we cannot define God or even understand his wisdom.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 1 Cor 1:25

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Courage in Battle

[![Courage in Battle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day307.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Pi-1cVOzSK4 "Courage in Battle")

### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Little by Little

[![Little by Little](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day308.jpg)](https://youtu.be/EfS1EQOPm8U "Little by Little")

### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God‚Äôs horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God‚Äôs power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord‚Äôs people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God‚Äôs horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know ‚Äì God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 308 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind;  And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us.  Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins.  Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.

### Praying for the Dead

[![Praying for the Dead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day309.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3TAqAFIpp30 "Praying for the Dead")

### Day 309 Praying for the dead

Judas Maccabeus fought more battles and was victories. In one of the battles some of his men were killed, given that it was the Sabbath they decided to go get the dead after they celebrated the sabbath.

On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs.
40But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.

He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, in as much as he had the resurrection in mind;
44for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
45But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
46Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin. 2 maccabees12: 39-40, 43-46

It may seem strange for them to do a collection of money and they offer a sin offering on behalf of the dead. Given that fact that they found the idols of Jamnia on them. In some for the Jewish men had committed idolatry. Why pray for them, Judas could have just declared that they died because of the just punishment and forgotten about them.

Praying for the dead is nothing new that the Catholics came up with, it‚Äôs a practice observed by the Jews. But why should we pray for the dead if they either go to heaven or hell. The only possible reason would be if there is a place of purification called purgatory where people with some minor sins await entry into heaven. Because God is so pure and holy, we would need to be fully purified to feel worthy of His presence. Hence the need for a place called purgatory.

As we recently celebrated All Souls Day, where we would have prayed for the dead in our family. Let us not forget to offer prayers for the souls in purgatory, especially for those souls that need a lot of prayer. Making sacrifices and Offering indulgences for them can speed up their entry into eternal bliss. Let us also teach our children to pray for the souls in purgatory, so when we die someone will pray for us also. üôÇ

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Rivals for the Heart

[![Rivals for the Heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day310.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3qZbUdJeNHc "Rivals for the Heart")

### Day 310 Patient Perseverance

‚ÄúBy patience is a ruler persuaded,
and a soft tongue can break a bone.‚Äù Prov 25:15

Many a thing in life is not achieved because we give up or give in. We start off with great zeal and fire to accomplish the goal, but on the way we either get distracted, discouraged, or impatient. Today‚Äôs proverb helps us to understand that some things in life require persistence and long-lasting effort.

For example when we open up the WhatsApp group for people to join ‚Äúthe Bible in a Year‚Äù program there are so many zealous ones who want to complete it. But we can always see a steady decline in the folks that are committed to completing the program. Although many successfully complete it in a year, most people like me may take 2 years or some 3. It is totally fine if you are not able to keep up due to life‚Äôs demands. God is merciful and gives us our whole life to read the Bible, also it is more important that the word becomes flesh. Head knowledge is good, but we also have to internalize the Bible and live it out, which is not easy. But we always have God‚Äôs mercy and kindness who helps us in our weakness, guides us in our difficulties and sustains us to complete the good deed that we have started.

We need to be calm and assertive trying our best to navigate life and live a Christ-centric life. When we have bad rulers or bad policies then pushing back hard against them may not work. We need to consistently oppose bad policies and rulers until our voice is heard and we need to pray for long-lasting motivation.

We see many examples in the world that we can learn from.

1. Thomas Edison did not give up trying to invent the light bulb after testing thousands of materials that would not make the right filament.

2. Look at Lincoln‚Äôs resume before he was elected president. Despite a past littered with failures; he became one of, if not the greatest Presidents of the United States.

3. Saint Frances Cabrini (‚ÄúMother Cabrini‚Äù). Despite her frail health and her strong desire to go to China, she was advised by the Pope to go west to America and minister to the immigrant population. Mother Cabrini founded sixty-seven institutions, including schools, hospitals, and orphanages, one for each of her sixty-seven years of life on this earth. She was also the first naturalized American Saint. A great example of what one person can do against all odds.

4. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton came from wealth, was married with children, and lived quite a different life from the widowed convert who was to found the Sisters of Charity and become the first American-born saint.

5. Saint Martin de Porres of Lima, Peru was the child of a black mother and a Spanish father. Because of this, he was ridiculed and severely mocked. However, through his great perseverance and humility, he was finally accepted into the Dominican order he so earnestly yearned to join and became a model for those who seek God through poverty, sacrifice, penance, and humility.

Let us be inspired by these examples in our lives and preserve with all our strength and energy to achieve what we have set out to do. Heaven is the biggest goal of our lives and we should persevere till the end to reach our goal. Of course, God will always pick us up every time we fall and carry us into heaven as long as our heart is set on Him.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### God Fights for You

[![God Fights for You](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day311.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PzsctVQ5s4I "God Fights for You")

### Day 311 Helping a troubled heart.

When we see troubled people, we usually either avoid them or try to cheer them on. Some people even go to the extent of betraying or abandoning someone when they are in trouble. This could be really hard on someone who desperately needs support.

The other approach some take is to try to cheer up the troubled person. Buy them a drink or try to  their minds with something or the other. This does not really help the person in trouble. The proverb in today‚Äôs reading teaches us just that.

A bad tooth or an unsteady foot‚Äî
a trust betrayed in time of trouble.
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
is the one who sings to a troubled heart. ‚Äì Proverbs 25:19-20

So what should be the right approach to someone who is in distress?
First thing to be done is to notice a person in trouble, in the parable of the good Smartian the priest and the Levite both did not even notice the person who was robbed and beaten.
But the Samaritan was moved with compassion, he stopped, took care of his wounds and even paid for his stay at an inn.

We should follow the approach of the good Smartian, be attentive to troubled people around us. We should do everything that we can to help out anyone who may be in trouble.
We are called to carry each other‚Äôs burdens.

‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Gal 6:2

We should always make friends and have each other‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their work; If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up.‚Äù Ecc 4:9-10

How pitiful it would be if you had no one who has your back, no one to pick you up when you fall. It usually would be the case if you did not pick someone up when they needed help. In the world we seem to be getting more and more isolated, we call it independence but I think we are missing out on something great.
We are God‚Äôs hands and God‚Äôs feet in this world. God promised that he would be close to the broken hearted. Let us make it our mission to be God‚Äôs hand and feet to the broken hearted person.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Ps 34:18

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Conclusion to the Old Testament

[![Conclusion to the Old Testament](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day312.jpg)](https://youtu.be/H2vXfX9lwdk "Conclusion to the Old Testament")

### Day 312 Rely fully on God

The great warrior Judas Maccabeus who won many battles where he was outnumbered, did not win by his own strength or the strength of his army. He always relied on the arm of God and the angels that God sent ahead of his battles.
Maccabeus, surveying the hosts before him, the variety of weaponry, and the fierceness of their beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he knew that it is not weapons but the Lord‚Äôs decision that brings victory to those who deserve it.

22Calling upon God, he spoke in this manner: ‚ÄúYou, master, sent your angel in the days of King Hezekiah of Judea, and he slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand men of Sennacherib‚Äôs camp.
23And now, Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to spread fear and trembling ahead of us.
24By the might of your arm may those be struck down who have blasphemously come against your holy people!‚Äù With these words he ended his prayer. 2 Maccabees 15:21-24

Let us learn this and apply it to life, we should try our best but rely fully on God to give us the victory. God will send his workers - ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù to fight for us and make a way for us to progress.
For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; Ps 91:11

God has placed a guardian angel in charge of us, also other angels play in important part in our lives. So let us now forget to invoke their help especially when we are on mission to do something.
Like the Israelite kings and leaders, we should not just put all our trust in our chariots and horses but depend fully on God. We should not just trust our education, financial backing, doctors and medicine, but we should know that all these are but a gift from God and that we rely on God for everything.

Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. Ps 20:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### The Ark of the New Covenant

### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

5. The Crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:18-30)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 313 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 1:24-27
*After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion.*
Why did Elizabeth remain in seclusion when she was the recipient of a miracle and the bearer of such good news?

In the Jewish culture, it was as disgraceful for a woman to be with child in her old age, as it was for a woman to be barren.  According to the Jews, a barren woman was a curse for society, and an old woman with child was looked down upon as a woman of ill repute.  Elizabeth, therefore, had to remain in seclusion so that the negativity would not have any negative emotional effect on her and on the child during the first five months of her pregnancy.

*She said, ‚Äúthe Lord has blessed me at a time when He has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.‚Äù*
These were the same words spoken by Rachel when the Lord blessed her with a child, because she was childless for many years. (Genesis 30:23).

*Six months later, the angel Gabriel was sent down by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph.  The Virgin‚Äôs name was Mary.*\
God sent His angel to ask Mary‚Äôs permission to be the mother of His Son.
We therefore honor Mary because God honored her first.

The first Exodus began when an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb and appointed him for the mission (Exodus 3:1-4).

The new Exodus began when Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and appointed her for the mission.

Betrothal involved sharing one cup of wine between the man and woman as a sign of acceptance of each other.
In the modern times the couple exchanges rings.

The fundamental point which is underscored by the virgin birth is that since Jesus doesn‚Äôt have a human father; His father must be looked for outside of the human realm.  His Father is not on earth but in Heaven because His Father is God.

Mary pleased God more than any other women did, and God was so pleased with her, that the new Adam took flesh and bone from her, the new Eve, and she became His immediate blood relative, an unparalleled honor.

In preparing herself more and more for the Savior, God transformed Mary, the Ark of the new Covenant, making her His mother, so that from an ordinary human being, she became His perfect resting place.

God continues to look for sincere and humble hearts preparing themselves for Him to rest in.\
Like Mary, when we carry Jesus in our hearts like a true family member, through our holy and obedient life, we will enable Him to make the world His resting place and thereby His own family.

Let us join our character to Mary‚Äôs so that we can make a perfect resting place in our hearts for her Son.

Luke 1:31-33
*And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus ("Yeshua" in Hebrew).*
During the incarnation, when the angel spoke and Mary gave her acceptance, the Word of God became flesh, and divine life (Jesus) entered a pure vessel (Mary) and thus a human (Mary) had a share in the divine life.

Similarly, the incarnational principle is applied when we receive the Bread of Life (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), after giving our acceptance (Amen) and thereafter we receive divine life (2 Peter 1:4).

*He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.*
Angel Gabriel quoted to Mary from God‚Äôs prophecy to David (2 Samuel 7: 12-16).

The angel had just announced to Mary that her son would be the future King in the Davidic kingdom.  By default, that made Mary (a descendant of David) (Romans 1:3) the future Queen Mother according to the pattern of the Davidic kingdom.

Luke 1:38
*"May it be done to me according to your Word."*
Surrendering our will to God is NOT when we say *"Lord, I will do as you say."*
Surrendering our will to God is when we say, like Mary, *" may it be done to me, Lord, according to Your Will/Word"* and like Jesus *‚Äú may Your will be done, Lord, not mine‚Äù* (Mark 14:32).

Mary understood that she was only a creature and had no power to carry out God's Will with her human abilities. Whatever God wanted to do through her had to be completely in God's control and power because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is strong resistance from the demonic spirit and humans cannot handle the demons without divine assistance.

This means that when God starts using us to carry out His Will we are bound to go through trials, tribulations, persecution and we may even have to give up our life.  The important thing is that through this journey we must ensure that we protect the purity of our soul, and not the safety of our body.

God is Spirit and therefore He prefers to use our bodies to do His Will on earth.  Let us surrender ourselves to His Will completely, like Mary and Jesus, irrespective of the storms we will have to face.  That is when we trust God.

A godly man will not have marital union with a woman unless he marries her with her whole hearted consent.  Angel Gabriel was therefore sent by the Holy Spirit to Mary with a marriage proposal.  When Mary gave her consent the Word of God became flesh in her womb and she became the spouse of the Holy Spirit, who works along with her, for the sanctification of the human race, to unite people to the Body of Christ.

Luke 1:40-41
Mary was already filled with the Holy Spirit when the Body of Christ was in her womb, therefore when she spoke the greeting (shalom) she poured out the Holy Spirit onto Elizabeth and onto the baby in Elizabeth‚Äôs womb.\
This was the time when John was baptized with the Holy Spirit thereby making him the bridegroom‚Äôs friend or ‚Äúbest man‚Äù who would prepare Israel for the coming of the bridegroom.

Jewish marriages always began with an inaugural dance, and John‚Äôs leaping in the womb was the symbolic dance of the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù to inaugurate the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) in Mary‚Äôs womb.

Similarly, in the infant Church, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and Cornelius and his household were eagerly listening to the Word from Peter, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard Peter (Acts 10:44).

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is automatically poured out onto those who eagerly hear the Word of God from us.

John was in his mother's womb and could not see Jesus in Mary‚Äôs womb, but John recognized the presence of Jesus through the voice of Mary.  Jesus spoke through His mother‚Äôs voice.

Let us humble ourselves like Mary so that Jesus can use our voices to speak to others and bless them.

Luke 1:42
Through the power of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth declared that Mary was blessed among all women.

Elizabeth represents all of those who pray the ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù prayer.  When we say the prayer, Mary visits us, to help us during our difficult times, just as she did with Elizabeth.

Luke 1:43
It wasn't Elizabeth, but the Holy Spirit, who addressed Mary as the ‚ÄúMother of my Lord‚Äù because neither was Elizabeth informed in advance in any way that Mary was with child nor did Mary explain anything to Elizabeth when she entered the house.

Luke 2:1-2\
Emperor Augustus considered himself to be a god and therefore wanted all his subjects to be registered in his kingdom so that he could increase his tax revenue.

But God wants us to be registered with His holy Kingdom (the Church), through baptism, so that we belong to His holy family to be with Him for eternity.

Luke 2:6-7
‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Hebrew means ‚ÄúHouse of Meat‚Äù and Hebrew is the language of the original old Testament books.

During the old Covenant Passover celebration, the congregation had to consume the meat of an earthly lamb.
This was a foreshadow of the Passover of the new Covenant.

‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Greek means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù and Greek is the language of the original new Testament books.

During the new Covenant Passover celebration (the Mass), the congregation has to consume the consecrated unleavened bread (Communion) which is the living mystical Body of the Lamb of God (Luke 22:19; John 6:54).

All this happened according to God‚Äôs plan.\
This is how God announced to the world that the Bread of Life (Jesus) was delivered at the House of Bread (Bethlehem) and was already served in the food box (manger) for the world to eat so that we can now have eternal life (John 6:54).

And God, therefore, made sure that David himself was born in Bethlehem.

*There was no room for them in the inn.*
There was no room for them in the inn (or guest houses) due to the influx of people who returned to their home town to enroll themselves.  They were therefore rejected by the world.
Rejection by the world can often lead to God‚Äôs greater plan being unveiled.

The inn was a symbol of our hearts.
When our hearts are filled with things of this world we become heartless, selfish and disrespectful and thus there is no room for Jesus in our hearts.

Jesus was born in the stable only because the humble shepherds made room for His mother to bring Him into their home.

Let us ask the mother of Jesus to guide us so that we can humble ourselves to make room in our hearts and she can bring her Son into our homes.

### DAY 313 By Sheila

LUKE. 1:5-25
An Angel appears to Zechariah and assured him of his prayers, his wife would bear a child, a son, to be named John.
When his service time was completed, he returned home to see his wife pregnant. There were litany of Praises to Our Awesome God.
His Power to bring fruitfulness, out of fertility and bring God's Will to fulfillment. God manifest His Might, not just by making the impossible possible but building on them His Great Plan of Salvation.

LUKE. 1:26-38
This speaks of Advent, The Lord Enters. He is the King Of Glory.
God's love for humanity is such that, He became like us. He chose His Son to be born through a Virgin, thus fulfilling the Prophecy that is part of God's Plan to save us. So much so that our human plans would fit his designs.
Like Mary, let us say: Let it be done to me as You have said.

### My Beloved Son

[![My Beloved Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day314.jpg)](https://youtu.be/R2fNUca2HAw "My Beloved Son")

### Day 314 Overcome temptations with prayer and fasting.

At the Baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form and the voice of the Father was heard. ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you, I am well pleased.‚Äù As soon as that happened, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasted and was tempted by the devil in every way.
The new Adam is able to withstand the temptations of the devil, as compared to the Adam. It seems like the three temptations were similar to the ones that Adam faced.

1. Good
   If you are the Son of God, command the stones to become a loaf of bread. Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúIt is written, ‚ÄòOne does not live by bread alone.‚Äô‚Äù
   Jesus being fully human(and fully God) was truly in need of food as He had fasted for 40 days. Satan takes a natural good and twists it to confuse us, to make it seem good. Jesus could have done that Miracle just as he made water into wine, but Jesus could see the evil scheme of the devil. Eve and Adam could not resist the offer of the devil to eat the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.

‚ÄúThe woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes‚Äù Gen 3:6

We also can fall into the temptation of the lust of the eyes, we could say this is really good we should have it.

2. Power
   Then he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.

6The devil said to him, ‚ÄúI shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I may give it to whomever I wish. All this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚ÄòYou shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.‚Äô

Satan tempts Jesus with power. Jesus had not yet won the victory on the cross. Satan wanted to give Jesus a short cut around the Passion and agony that he would need to go through. But Jesus resisted for worship is only due to God, no person or object or thing or power deserves our worship.
Eve and Adam could not resist the temptation of power, they were going to get similar power as God or similar knowledge as God.
‚ÄúGod knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5
We also crave power, we crave to control situations and people. Who does not want their own way in matters. Let us keep it at check and offer all due worship to God, let‚Äôs just seek His will.

3. Distrust
   Then he led him to Jerusalem, made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
   10 for it is written:
   ‚ÄòHe will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,‚Äô and:‚ÄòWith their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.‚Äô‚Äù 12Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòYou shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test‚Äù
   Satan tried to push the buttons of distrust, he was like will not God send his angles when you will fall. So give it a test, try to fall and let‚Äôs see if it's true. Did not work, Jesus like the previous times quoted the scripture and confessed His belief.

Our first parents gave into the distrust ‚Äòtest‚Äô, and gave into doubt.
But the snake said to the woman: ‚ÄúYou certainly will not die!

5God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know\* good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

They were like what is God does not have our best interest in mind? What if God is so selfish that He wants to keep wisdom and power from all, just so that He can rule the world.
Satan will try to sow doubt in your minds, he will bring up a lot of negative thoughts about God. Will God really provide for you? Will he really heal you? Does God really love you, look how terrible you are? Will God really forgive you, you commit this sin over and over again.
We need to fight against these voices and believe the God is Good and loves us beyond our wildest imaginations. What God has for us no eye has seen no ear has heard, for the plans He has for us is for our own good.
Let us fight against temptations of the eyes, flesh and pride but fasting and prayer.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 314 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 3:10-14
*What then should we do?*

As John tells us, the most important thing to do is to repent.  We must examine our conscience and correct our errors before repenting.  But it is not sufficient only to repent.  John tells us that we must prove our faith through works of charity, honesty, and social justice.

We can start by sharing with the less fortunate whatever food and clothes that we have in excess (v. 11) because sharing is fundamental to our faith, not only after repentance, but always.\
John tells us that whatever job we do we must do it with honesty (v. 13).\
We must not let greed control us (v. 14).\
Whatever we do we must do it to please God.

One of the prominent marks in today‚Äôs world is the absence of guilt for sins, thus minimizing repentance or almost eliminating it.  Most people feel repentance is old fashioned.  Others make a show of repentance for personal gain.  Yet others may say a robotic ‚Äúsorry‚Äù only when they are caught.  But repentance is more than just saying robotic words or reading prayers of repentance from a book.  Repentance means turning around from our material lives, detaching ourselves from earthly bondage and following Christ with our whole heart.

John tells us to prepare our hearts to welcome the Lord.  He wants us to discard all the obstacles which block us from following Christ.
To prepare the way for the Lord in our hearts we must focus on the fundamentals of our faith which are *‚Äúrepentance, sharing and serving.‚Äù*

Luke 3:21-22
*The Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.

Original sin is the loss of divine life within us, which gives us sanctifying grace to perfect our souls and enables us to enter Heaven and stand in the presence of God.

When Jesus was baptised the Holy Spirit descended on the Son in the presence of the Father.

Likewise, when we are baptized we receive the life of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (divine life) within us. And whenever we destroy this divine life with our sins we can have it restored by receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace (Sacrament of Reconciliation / Confession), because we are baptized.

The old Covenant people did not have this privilege because their baptism was symbolic, not sacramental.

Luke 3:23
Like Matthew, Luke also focuses on the royal lineage of Jesus.
Matthew shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Solomon through Jacob, but Luke shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Nathan through Heli.

How could this be possible?

The Levirate law allowed a woman to marry a brother of her ex-husband (in the case of divorce), or the brother of her deceased husband (in the case of widowhood), even if, in both cases, the men already had children.  However, if the men, in both cases, did not have a brother or if the brother refused to marry her, then the woman was allowed to marry the next of kin of her previous husband, as in the case of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 4:13).

Joseph had a natural father (Jacob) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Solomon, and a legal father (Heli) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Nathan.

How could Jacob and his brother Heli have two different fathers?

Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha first married Matthan (a descendant of Solomon) and they became the parents of Jacob.

After the death of Matthan Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha then married Melchi (a descendant of Nathan, but of the same tribe) and they became the parents of Heli.

Heli married Joseph‚Äôs mother but he died without leaving any children.

Thereafter his brother Jacob married Joseph's mother and they became the parents of Joseph.

In short:
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the natural line were David > Solomon >>>> Matthan > Jacob.
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the legal line were David > Nathan >>>> Melchi > Heli.

It was important to protect the genealogical line of the Messiah because in order to be the Messiah, he had to be the prophetic ‚ÄúLion of the Tribe of Judah‚Äù (Genesis 49:10) and the ‚Äúroot of David‚Äù (2 Samuel 7:13-14;  (Revelation 5:5).

This is the main reason (among others) for the careful inclusions of the genealogies in both the Old and New Covenants.
It stresses the fact that the existence of these genealogies are not the result of human effort or holiness; they are wholly dependent upon the power of God that guarantees them.

Therefore, inspite of Satan‚Äôs efforts through the rebellion of all the ungrateful humans, God has still kept His promise of a Savior for the world from the line of Seth through Judah to Jesus.

Luke 4:1-12
Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us to remind us which scripture we can apply to a particular situation.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.

Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Jesus could have told the devil to go away but He did not because that would not be a good model for humans.  Due to the weakness of our souls we cannot beat the tricky and deceptive forces of evil on our own.  Jesus quoted scripture to overcome the devil to show us that we too must follow the same.

Luke 4:3 & 9
*Then the devil came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, ........*

Satan didn't say "if you are the prophet, priest or king......."
Satan was directly attacking the family relation between Jesus and His heavenly Father by challenging Jesus to defy His Father.

Satan tried the same trick with Adam and Eve by asking them, "did God say.......?"\
He twisted the Word of God, poisoned their minds against God their Father and succeeded in making them challenge God by disobeying Him.

Similarly, since all baptized people are the children of God, Satan will always try in many ways to tempt us with power, wealth, possessions, comfort, entertainment, etc. and by twisting the Word of God, to separate us from our heavenly Father.

Let us always be alert to the devil's tricks by reading the Word of God every day, daily prayers, obeying God's commandments in our daily lives, and regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion).

Humans are created in the image and likeness of God therefore family and human identity has been the devil's target.

Adam and Eve's minds were poisoned against God who created them.

In today‚Äôs world, divorces are increasing and young children are being brainwashed into believing that they can choose to belong to any gender they wish, if they are not happy with their gender.

Luke 4:3-12
Jesus began His public ministry with both prayer and fasting. This is a good formula for us in our lives.

Before we take any action, we should start with prayer, asking for God‚Äôs guidance and His Will in our lives.

Fasting is also beneficial for each one of us. When unchecked, our passions begin to rule us. However, by fasting and self-denial, we are reminding our passions of who is the boss. We then become more free to direct our lives towards what is truly good, and free to follow the good Lord more closely.

Luke 4:6
*"All these kingdoms have been handed over to me, and all this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù*
When the world was created, it belonged to Jesus in its sanctified form and it was handed over to Adam to rule over it.  But when Adam made a Covenant with Satan by disobeying God and eating the forbidden fruit, Adam automatically transferred his dominion to Satan, and thus Satan became the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30), which is why the power of evil was greater than the power of good, in the old Covenant.  We, the baptized ones, are now God's people living in an enemy occupied territory (the world).

Satan was telling Jesus that Jesus would get back all what initially belonged to Him, only if Jesus worshipped Satan.

Jesus didn't need Satan to hand the kingdoms of the world over to Him.  By His holy life, death and resurrection, Jesus gave us access to the fruit of life (the consecrated bread / Eucharist) and thus got us back the authority to rule over God's kingdom on earth (the Church) which Satan is trying to corrupt and destroy, internally and externally, just as he deceived Adam and Eve into destroying the sanctified world.

Luke 4:13
Although Jesus passed every test, Satan was not done with Jesus.  Satan was alert 24x7x12 waiting for a chance to trap Jesus again.  Throughout the ministry of Jesus we see Satan using the people around Jesus to overpower or destroy Jesus by their accusations, attempts to attack, tricky questions, etc.

When we have defeated the devil once, we cannot remain off-guard thinking that he will not attack us again.  Satan has a million ways of tricking people.  Whatever we are focused on, Satan will use that to lead us away from God, smoothly, without us having the slightest doubt that we are on the wrong path.  That is where our daily communication with God through prayers and reading the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes, will help us.

Let us stay alert to sin, pray every day for divine assistance and ensure that we read the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes

Luke 5:3
The crowds represent the flock of Christ and the boat represents the Church, the Ark of God.\
Jesus still speaks to His flock (the faithful Christians) from Simon's boat (the Church).

Luke 5:4
If we have tried sharing the Word of God with others, or doing other works for God, and failed in our mission, the Lord maybe just training us and preparing us to venture further into difficult areas.  Let us move ahead without hesitation because THE LORD WANTS US TO DO IT.

Luke 5:6
When we venture further into difficult areas in obedience to the Lord, inspite of our failures, the Lord will bless our efforts with so much abundance that we may not be able to handle it on our own and we may need assistance from our family, friends, relatives, colleagues, or anyone else.

[![The Virtue of Mercy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day315.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tHwiu0_6paw "The Virtue of Mercy")

### Day 315 Faith and Love

We see some great examples of faith, the Roman centurion whose servant was sick. The Centurion sent word for Jesus to come to his home but later realized that he was not worthy to have a holy man enter his house, so he went out to meet Jesus and petitioned the Lord with great words of faith.

And Jesus went with them, but when he was only a short distance from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, ‚ÄúLord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof.
7Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but say the word and let my servant be healed.
8For I too am a person subject to authority, with soldiers subject to me. And I say to one, ‚ÄòGo,‚Äô and he goes; and to another, ‚ÄòCome here,‚Äô and he comes; and to my slave, ‚ÄòDo this,‚Äô and he does it.‚Äù
9When Jesus heard this he was amazed at him and, turning, said to the crowd following him, ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
10When the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave in good health. Luke 7:6-10
We sometimes underestimate the power of God, we think that the Lord will work one way but do not realize that God just has to say a word and things will happen. We need to have faith when we pray, it should touch the heart of Jesus just as the centurion‚Äôs words did. Jesus should respond to our prayer ‚ÄúI tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.‚Äù
Along with faith we should also have love for the Lord. We see the example of Mary
A Pharisee invited him to dine with him, and he entered the Pharisee‚Äôs house and reclined at table.
37Now there was a sinful woman in the city who learned that he was at table in the house of the Pharisee. Bringing an alabaster flask of ointment,
38she stood behind him at his feet weeping and began to bathe his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and anointed them with the ointment.
39When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself, ‚ÄúIf this man were a prophet, he would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.‚Äù
40Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúSimon, I have something to say to you.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me, teacher,‚Äù he said.
41‚ÄúTwo people were in debt to a certain creditor; one owed five hundred days‚Äô wages\* and the other owed fifty.
42Since they were unable to repay the debt, he forgave it for both. Which of them will love him more?‚Äù
43Simon said in reply, ‚ÄúThe one, I suppose, whose larger debt was forgiven.‚Äù He said to him, ‚ÄúYou have judged rightly.‚Äù
44Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, ‚ÄúDo you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give me water for my feet, but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
45You did not give me a kiss, but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered.
46You did not anoint my head with oil, but she anointed my feet with ointment.
47So I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.‚Äù
48He said to her, ‚ÄúYour sins are forgiven.‚Äù
49The others at table said to themselves, ‚ÄúWho is this who even forgives sins?‚Äù
50But he said to the woman, ‚ÄúYour faith has saved you; go in peace.‚Äù

We see the beautiful expression of love that the sinful woman, many believe is Mary Magdalene. She had such love for the Lord that she didn‚Äôt hesitate to pour out costly ointment on his feet. How is our love for the Lord, do we love like the Pharisees or like the sinner? Do we love Jesus less or love Him more. Do we give to the poor and the church a little of our time, talent and treasure or give it freely.
Let us pray that we should have both faith and love for our dear Lord Jesus. Let us have faith believing that Jesus can do anything for us and love Him unendingly, I don‚Äôt know about you but I feel that Jesus has forgiven me a lot of my sins. He died for me and loves me dearly.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Absolute Surrender

[![Absolute Surrender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day316.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fJ4gt4sW5Y4 "Absolute Surrender")

### Day 316 Deny yourself and come follow me.

Many people come to Jesus for a reason, they either want to be healed or receive a favor. Jesus wants to heal and provide for us but He wants something more, a loving and living relationship. Jesus invites us to this beautiful relationship, like one of a shepherd and the sheep. Jesus calls the 12 and gives them authority to drive out demons and to heal the sick. When they return Jesus does more Miracles like the feeding of the 5000. He later sends out the 72 who are able to heal and deliver people from demon possession. What is more important than doing works for the Lord is knowing the Lord.

That is why Jesus asked His disciples Who do you say I am? To which Peter replied ‚ÄúThe Messiah of God.‚Äù We are called to discover Christ first before we decide to go out and do works for Him.

In discovering Christ we will have our moments of Transfiguration where Jesus will reveal Himself to us so that we will know that our God is the creator of the world, all-powerful, all-knowing and every loving.

Once we realize who calls us and what is our mission, we will be able to deny ourselves daily and pickup our cross and follow Jesus.

Then he said to all, ‚ÄúIf anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
24For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
25What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself?
26Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Luke 9:23-26

We are called to lose our life, keep our pride by the side, speak about Jesus openly with our friends and family. Take a stand for Jesus in the anti-life culture.

We sometimes like Peter, John and James may want to remain on Spiritual highs, build booths at the transfiguration and not come back to reality. Or like Martha, we may get overly anxious of the worries and cares of the day, that we so forget the Lord. One thing is needed and we should choose that. That is to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to every word He says.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Persistence in Prayer

[![Persistence in Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day317.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1Cq89cCv0SA "Persistence in Prayer")

### Day 317 Do not be anxious about tomorrow.

Most of us are such control freaks when it comes to our lives. We have our schedules booked out months in advance and holidays a year in advance. We know when we would upgrade our next iphone and when we should retire. Although it‚Äôs good to plan it‚Äôs not good to worry about things of the future. We are called to have dependence on God, rather than depending on our abilities and securities.
Dependence on God.

He said to \[his\] disciples, ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear.
23For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
24Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds!
25Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span?
26If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you anxious about the rest?
Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them.
28If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?
29As for you, do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not worry anymore.
30All the nations of the world seek for these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
31Instead, seek his kingdom, and these other things will be given you besides.
32Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
33Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.
34For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. Luke 12:22-34

I could not help but put the whole test from Luke, as it has been therapeutic each time I read it. Whenever you are stressed about the future and are not sure of what you will eat or drink or stay. Remember that God the Father feeds the birds of the air and the clothes the lilies of the field.

We are called to be rely on God alone and not on our own abilities and strengths. No matter how strong, rich, powerful or famous you may be today, it all can be taken away in a second. We need to remember that everything we have now is only a gift from God, for all good things comes from the Lord. We need not be overly concerned about storing up riches on earth, we should instead focus on storing up riches in heaven. Doing good deeds and living a good life with Jesus at the center. We should be like the 5 wise virgins who stored up extra oil, the good deeds. We should make for us bags that we can carry into heaven, something that cannot be stolen from us, it becomes an inexhaustible treasure.
But what to do when worries and anxieties knock on our door, we should pray. Pray the prayer Jesus taught us, Our Father. Just these words should be good enough to suppress all worries, for if God is our Father there is nothing we shall fear for if God is for us who can be against us. We should pray for our daily bread, and also be fed by the Eucharist every day ‚Äúthe‚Äù daily bread.

Let us know fear or worry, for each of the hairs on our head has been numbered.
Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. Luke 12:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 317 By Sheila

Luke 11:15-26.
Jesus is accused of serving and doing evil by evil's power. Yet all what Jesus does is good. Healing, curing, forgiving, giving people food, hope and good news.
Jesus warns that there will be a day of Judgment for them and we must be careful that we have not become evil ourselves. All is just fine that all is well because we believe in God.
Are we mindful of other's goodness or are we always looking for evil.

Luke 11:27-28.
While Jesus was speaking the Word of God, a woman spoke from the crowd in blessing and in truth. Blessing for the woman who gave birth and nursed You as a child. Jesus refuses, and says, NO. Rather blessed is the one who hears the Word of God and keeps it. This is more important than any blessings, any relationship of human kingship, marriage, family and parents.
He adds, we are given birth in the Word of God and we must make sure that this WORD grows within us.

### BIAY Day 317 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 11:1
*Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‚ÄúLord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.‚Äù*
Prayer is not about giving God information or changing his mind.  Prayer is an activity which God wants us to do because it draws us out of ourselves and builds relationships, with God and with our fellow human beings.

By praying to God and on behalf of others, we learn to care about both, thus helping us fulfill the two great commandments: love of God and love of neighbor (Luke 10:27).

We usually remember John the Baptist as a baptizer who called people to repent.  But here the Bible tells us that John was a man of prayer and he also had his own disciples, some of whom, we know, followed Jesus.

Luke 11:3
*Give us this day our daily bread.*
We ask God, not only for our earthly bread but, also for our supernatural / consecrated bread, the Body of Christ (epi ousios in Greek) to keep our souls nourished as long as we live on earth.

Luke 11:4
*And forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sinned against us.*
‚ÄúForgive our offenders‚Äù does not mean that we must free them if they are in the custody of the authorities for a crime.  "Forgive our offenders" means we make a petition to God from our hearts, to forgive them, thus confirming that we have no grudge against our offenders in our hearts.  This action from us allows God's grace to flow through us to convert them.
*Lead us not into temptation / to the final test).*
God does not tempt people (James 1:13).  God allows the devil to tempt us for the purpose of testing our faith (Revelation 2:10; James 1:12), just as it was with Jesus (Matthew 4:1).

Luke 11:5-8\
Persistent prayer purifies our body (tongue) and mind (thoughts), and strengthens our soul.  We must pray continuously (1 Thessalonians 5:17), even if we have to repeat the same prayer over and over again (Matthew 26:44; Mark 14:39).  Praying repeatedly is not for the purpose of getting what we want but to purify ourselves and strengthen ourselves spiritually.

Persistent prayer is like pushing a large rock.  Our duty is to keep pushing, even if it takes days, months or years and the rock doesn't move, and even if we are criticized or mocked for our futile persistence.  God will move the rock when the time is right.

Luke 11:9-10
Jesus didn't promise us that we will receive what we *want* (material gifts) whenever we ask, search or knock.  God is not a vending machine to give us whatever material gifts we ask for. He provides us with our daily needs even if we don‚Äôt ask for it.  God is more interested in the purity of our souls and love for our neighbor to make us worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven.  Therefore Jesus wants us to focus on asking for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13) to help us so that we can use our spiritual gifts how God wants us to.

Luke 11:14-23
Let us be alert to the Beelzebuls in our lives who try to create divisions between us and our family, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.  If they can't do it with violence they may come as humble, loving, friendly people in our lives and convince us to do something ungodly against the wishes of our family members.\
Or they may want us to choose between two friends / relatives / colleagues /neighbours / etc. who are at war with each other.
If we live in obedience to God we will be able to recognize these Beelzebuls, control them and maintain our relationship with others.
Let us take the demons in our lives to Jesus so that He can cast them out by helping us to live in total obedience to God.

Jesus acknowledged that the Jews performed valid exorcisms (Luke 11:19).

Luke 11:24-26
It is not enough to get rid of evil spirits through prayer, exorcism, etc.  A clean house is a house from where an evil spirit has been driven out but divine life is not present in that person, leaving that person vulnerable to the demonic.

When we are baptized we are released from the bondage of Satan, but if we don‚Äôt keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us with humility, daily prayers, good works of mercy, reading the Bible, fasting, etc., and most importantly, the regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion), then the evil spirits will gradually return and start multiplying.  We will find our focus shifting gradually from "pleasing God" to "pleasing humans" for prosperity, appreciation, acceptance in society, etc. and our humility will turn to pride which will in turn invite anger, hatred, envy, gossip, greed, etc.

Let us keep our focus fixed on God and continue pleasing Him in all we do and say, while we keep the flame of the Holy Spirit burning within us.

Luke 11:27-28
A woman is not blessed just because she bears children in her womb and nurses them; she is blessed only when she hears the Word of God and obeys it.
Mary was the first Christian who heard the Word of God through the Angel Gabriel and obeyed it, even before Jesus was born (Luke 1:38).\
Mary was the first Christian who accepted Jesus in her life as her God and Saviour, even before He was born (Luke 1:47).

Jesus didn‚Äôt want His mother to be blessed only because she bore Him in her womb and nursed Him.  Billions of women have borne children in their wombs and nursed them.  Instead, He blessed her for her knowledge of the scriptures and her obedience to God, even though she knew she could be stoned to death, which was the reason why He was able to come into this world and thus fulfill God‚Äôs divine plan for redemption of humanity.
Jesus was therefore blessing His own Mother for hearing the Word of God and obeying it, just as Elizabeth too had blessed her three decades earlier (Luke 1:45).

Luke 11:34-36
One example of not using our eyes positively is ‚Äúgender confusion‚Äù where the person wants to look like the opposite gender.
A person's gender reveals how that person will contribute to bring forth new life. This is the theology of the body. Therefore, when we interfere with the biology of the body we end up interfering with the theology of the body.
At best we can only reconstruct the outer appearance of a person wanting to re-assign his/her gender but no human can create the life-giving elements inside the newly modified body. They can only castrate themselves to stop production of the existing life-giving elements.
The diabolic forces don't want humans to understand the beauty of the human body and therefore they confuse humans with gender identity.
Thus, if our eyes cannot see the beauty in God‚Äôs creation then we will be living in total darkness.

Luke 11:41
*But as to what is within, give alms and everything will be clean for you.*
Almsgiving is an antidote for wickedness and greed.

Luke 12:13-15
It was a normal practice for the Jews to seek assistance from the Rabbis in the matter of disputes.
Family disputes for property and possessions arise out of greed and avarice which Jesus was preaching against.  Jesus wants people to focus on their heavenly inheritance, not their earthly inheritance.

Luke 12:16-21
6 times the rich man said "I."
4 times he said "my."
In the entire parable there is neither any thanksgiving to God for the abundance of crop nor even any mention of God.

When our hearts are filled with greed we think only about "I, me myself and mine‚Äù because we make ourselves the gods and our desire will be to please only ourselves.  We neither think about others nor do we think about God.

In today‚Äôs world we may not have barns to store up our goods but we put too much faith in our money and possessions and we believe that if we hoard sufficient wealth and possessions in this world then we are secure so we don't need God or His commandments and we don't even need to go to Church. Thus we will spend our time focusing on the less important things and miss out on what is more important for our eternal life.

God blesses us with abundance, not because He wants us to hoard the excess, but, because He wants us to share the excess with the less fortunate ones.
Seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and all the rest will be given to you (Matthew 6:33).

True wealth is spiritual wealth or being rich towards God. A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.
Let us therefore not waste our time slogging all day long to acquire more than what we need and thus end the day with no time and energy left for God.

Let us not forget to give thanks to God in everything.

Luke 12:31
*Seek FIRST the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.*
Jesus is NOT telling us to give up our jobs or leave our homes and families and sit in the Church the whole day.
Jesus does not say, "seek ONLY the tkingdom of God" but He does tell us to give priority to the kingdom of God.
This means:

1. we must not miss our daily prayers.
2. we must not miss Sunday Mass even if we have important earthly activities on our agenda.
3. we must confess our sins regularly (at least once or twice a year) if we are trying to change our sinful life. In the event of mortal sin we must seek forgiveness for our sins immediately.
4. whenever we make a decision, we must make sure it is in line with God‚Äôs Commandments.
   These are just some of the ways to give priority to God and seek His righteousness.

Luke 12:33-34
Anxiety about earthly things should not be the behavior of a Christian.  It is a pagan behavior.  Christians who trust in God will not be worried about earthly possessions.\
Our treasury of material wealth on earth can be lost if it is stolen or destroyed by insects or worms, but our treasury of spiritual wealth can never be stolen or destroyed because it will be guarded in Heaven by the Lord. The only possible way we can lose our spiritual wealth is if we choose to follow the devil's ways.

Luke 12:48
*From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required;*
In the new Covenant, we have been given the power of the Holy Spirit to help us keep the new law (John 15:12).  Therefore, we have no excuse to bring Heaven on earth by loving, caring for and sharing with the people around us in obedience to the new commandment (John 15:12).

Luke 12:57-59
Christians must resolve their disputes within the community with peace, love and understanding, because they belong to God‚Äôs holy Kingdom and they are supposed to follow the new Covenant law of love.  Christians must therefore not take their disputes outside the community to the pagan courts.

### The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son

[![The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day318.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uRbeK7f4QKM "The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son")

### Day 318 The real Prodigal son

We read the parable of the Lost sheep, where Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes in search of the lost sheep that tried to get away from the flock. We need to know that God is always reaching out to us and willing to come find us no matter how evil or lost we may be.

Just as the woman in the parable of the Lost Coin, God is always searching for us, doing everything (she lights a lamp, sweeps the whole house, and searches until she finds it). We need to be more open to the voice of the Lord and be aware of the different opportunities we are presented to know God.

In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, we read about the younger son who demands his share of the property. According to most customs in the world today and more so back in Jesus times, the property was only received as a gift from the parents after they passed away.
The younger son's demand for the property is highly insulting, subtly suggesting that he wishes his father would hurry up and die. He said ‚ÄúGive me the property that belongs to me‚Äù, first of all, that is a gift and a gift cannot be demanded.

This is similar to what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden, they took for themselves what they wanted. They did not wait for God to give them the gift but wanted to snatch it and become equals to God in wisdom.
I feel that the second son also falls into this category when he wants to demand and take something for himself and for his friends.
All these years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never once disobeyed your orders. Even so, you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Luke 15:29

The words ‚Äúslave‚Äù and ‚Äúorder‚Äù are not words that a son would say. The second son although always with the father has not understood his relationship with the father. He considers himself a slave and not a son.

The younger son went off to a far-off country, away from the father's care but also away from any boundaries, beliefs, or rules of the father. The elder son although physically present with the father, internally separated himself from the father's care and had a broken/misunderstood relationship with the father.

When the younger son squandered all his money on dissolute living and famine hit, he had no choice but to work for a citizen of the far of country, the job any Jew would despise, feeding the swine. As he went far from his father‚Äôs house, he stripped himself of all his spiritual practices and did things that he would have never dreamt of doing.

Most of us have been in this place in our lives, we have wasted all the blessings God has given us, and we do the worst things we can think of - go to that extent that we once never even imagined we would.

But the important part of the story is when the son came to the realization of his identity as the son and this helped him discover who his father was. He says in my father's house even the servants are treated well, he probably remembers all the years of his life, the goodness of his father.

He decides to go back to his father‚Äôs house, repent from his bad ways and be a servant in his father‚Äôs house.

The father was waiting for his son, on the lookout every day. Now it was uncommon to see an elderly Jewish father run to their children, it was usually the other way around as the elders were highly respected. God comes running to us even though we don‚Äôt deserve it, it is true. If we ask why would God who created the world even bother with a sinner like me, we have not understood the heart of God.

When the father sees the son, his poor condition. The souls of his feet must have been worn out due to the long travel barefoot, but more importantly his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù was in bad shape. He had lived a very poor spiritual life which would have caused him to feel like a slave unworthy of the father's love.

The father sees it all, he places sandals on his feet, a ring on his figure and a robe on him. He restores the son back as an heir, the sandals are a symbol of a freeman, the ring symbolizes authority as a son, and the robe symbolizes that his dignity was restored. The prodigal son is now restored back to being the son of the father.
God the Father invites each of us back, we are His children.

To the dismay of everyone, the actual prodigal son is the elder son, who lived with the father all along but did not live as a son. He considered himself a slave and demanded his rights, though he was following the orders of his father.
We may identify with the elder son, we call ourselves Christians but crib about the commandments we are called to follow. We complain about the church teachings and are intolerant to our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We get irritable when we do not get our prayers answered, we are trying to work our way up to heaven "mentality of following his orders" instead of loving his word. We are grudgingly saying ‚ÄúI followed all your orders, you did not give me a calf to celebrate with my friends.‚Äù We are envious of others and so proud that we hate to see someone do better than us, even in church circles.

We are all prodigal sons, some choose to repent and some don‚Äôt. Let us run to the arms of the Father. Who is waiting for us, searching for us, and coming after us like the good Shepherd.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 318 By Sheila

Luke 13:18-19  The Kingdom of God -  Jesus' Power and Presence in the World. It is like a mustard seed, so tiny, so as to be unnoticed. But once it is planted it can take over an entire field, just as it is meant to take over our lives and the lives of all around us. It grows to be a sheltering presence for others.

Luke 14:1, 7-11  Most of the early members of the Church were Jews. Jesus was a Jew but many in Israel did not come to believe that Jesus was the awaited Messiah because He was more than that, more than what was awaited - He was GOD. For those who believe that He is the fullness of the promises, the law and the hopes of all the years of waiting.
Now God in Jesus belongs to every tribe and Nation. But Israel is beloved of God always. They were His First people, His dearest treasure and God's gifts are irrevocable. We must be careful not to let others words influence negatively how we feel and relate to people. Our lives must reveal the Presence of God in Jesus, Crucified and Risen. We must live humbly, truthfully and with respect for all.

Luke 13:3
*No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.*
The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower, all died physical or natural death. But Jesus was talking about spiritual death.

The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower tragedy perished physically. But if we don't repent for our sins then we will perish spiritually.

Sometimes bad things may happen to us for reasons we don‚Äôt understand but best known to God, and we may have to suffer for the sins of others.  Therefore, it is always wise to repent and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that such misfortunes may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death because death can come to us anytime, anywhere.

Luke 13:6-9
The fig tree is a familiar Old Testament symbol for Israel (Jeremiah 24:1‚Äì10). As the fig tree is given one last season to produce fruit before it is cut down, so too Jesus is giving Israel one final opportunity to bear good fruits as evidence of its repentance (Luke 3:8).
It was three years since Jesus started His Ministry and He didn't see any positive changes in most of the people.
We are created by the heavenly Gardner to be producers of good fruit. But like the fig tree, if we don't produce good fruit then our end will be like that of the fig tree.
Jesus is telling us that God is patient with us and gives us plenty of time to repent and start producing good fruit.  Let us make use of that time to get closer to God do His Kingdom work.
A fig tree normally takes 3 years to produce fruits.  Inspite of constant watering and nourishment the fig tree did not produce fruits so the gardener requested for more time.
A repentant sinner is God‚Äôs prize possession therefore God will not give up on anyone who struggles to come back to Him inspite of all the spiritual nourishment, but He will not wait indefinitely.

Luke 13:10-17
Jesus deliberately healed the crippled woman on the Sabbath, not to challenge the  religious authorities of the synagogue, but to show them and everyone else that Sabbath rest was not given to humans to become slaves of the law, but to begin the day with holiness and good works of mercy, because the rest if the week they were busy with their daily duties, caring for their families and earning their living.

In the new Covenant also the Sabbath rest is given to us also for the same reason. Sabbath rest is a reminder for us of our eternal rest with God. Therefore we must spend the day with holiness by worshipping the Lord (Mass) and then focusing on good work for the community so that God can use us to help the less fortunate ones.

The religious authorities didn't see the leading of an animal to the water as work but they saw healing a helpless human as work. They valued animals and ignored the less fortunate humans when in fact they should have given priority to the needs of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and then attended to the animals.

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt give too much preference to our pets and ignore the humans in need.  Let us give priority to the needs of God‚Äôs children and then attend to our pets.

Luke 14:7-14
Jesus was not giving advise on how and with whom we must socialize.
And sitting at the lowest place is not a trick for getting promoted.\
While Jesus was literally speaking about humility of guests at a feast (Proverbs 25:6‚Äì7), He was also applying the same principle to us (the guests) at the heavenly marriage feast.

When we attend the marriage feast of the Lamb (the Mass) in Church every Sunday, we must approach the Altar, with  humility, not with pride (Sirach 3:17-20).
The Altar on earth represents the Altar in Heaven (the Body of Christ) therefore what we do on earth during worship is what we will be doing in Heaven and there is no place in Heaven for pride.

Jesus was telling the host of the feast that feeding the well-fed people is not as pleasing to God as feeding the less fortunate ones.  In other words, don‚Äôt invite those who can afford to invite you in return.
God gives us success in our material life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones.  By this we practice generosity which is very pleasing to God and our generosity must always be a one-way act.

Let us glorify the Lord by being merciful to the less fortunate ones and releasing them from bondage of poverty and suffering, remembering that we ourselves were once ransomed from bondage of sin by the price of His Blood (1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20).

Our natural human tendency is to always look for our benefits when we give alms or do some good work.  But if we get our reward in this life, then we will not get our reward from God after this life.  Our reward in this life may be in the form of publicity, favours, recognition, praise, etc.

Luke 14:26
*Whoever comes to me and does not hate Father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.*
Jesus is not asking us to despise our family members or create barriers between us and them.\
Jesus is telling us not to get attached to our family members and the pleasures of this life because if we do get attached then He will become secondary in our lives and humans and the pleasures of this life will become primary and that will give Satan the opportunity to start controlling our lives, thereby destroying our souls.
Jesus wants us to detach ourselves from the desires and pleasures of this life and make Him the ruler of our lives so that in whatever we do and say we please Jesus and not humans.

Luke 15:5
*When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.*
A shepherd keeps the strayed sheep on his shoulder because when a sheep goes astray it is helpless and frightened and therefore it doesn't move on its own even if prodded.
We too are like the sheep when we go away from God and fall into a crisis.

Luke 15:10\
*In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.*
Heaven rejoices when we make a good confession.
Just as there is great rejoicing in Heaven over every repentant sinner, there is also much sorrow in Heaven when a righteous person goes away from God.
Whenever we lose our near and dear ones or something of great value, we are filled with sorrow or grief.\
Through our feelings for the lost things or people on earth, God shows us how He feels for every soul that is lost (goes to Hell).\
Jesus gave His life for us to save us from going to Hell.  Let us, therefore, not be the cause of our Lord‚Äôs grief.

Luke 15:11-32
The Prodigal son left the place of sin and returned to his father's house. He did not buy a house in the foreign land with the intention of going back to that sinful life again during his vacation.
Repenting for our sins for convenience purpose, with the intention of going back to our sinful life, is not true repentance.

The Prodigal son abandoned his father's house, it led him into a sinful life which brought him misery, then he repented and returned and the father welcomed him with great joy.\
All these steps are the process of conversion of a sinner.

The Prodigal son was an image of Israel.
The Israelites had left their home (Canaan) to go to a far-off foreign land (Egypt). They enjoyed life for a while, then they were subject to slavery followed by difficult times in the desert but finally they reached the promised land (Israel) and were happy.
Likewise the Prodigal son is also an image of us.

This parable has a sacramental principle.
Our earthly inheritance is a shadow of our heavenly inheritance (Baptism).
In both cases the inheritance is a gift, not our right.  We don‚Äôt do anything to earn our inheritance.
Like our earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is also handed down to us by our parents, guardians or elders through baptism.  But during our lifetime we separate ourselves from our heavenly Father by blending with the pagan world and committing mortal sins, and thereby squandering our heavenly inheritance.  Thus, we become ritually unclean.  To return to our heavenly Father we must repent and confess our sins.  Thereafter our heavenly Father will renew the broken Covenant (signet ring) when we make atonement for our sins by offering the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ during Mass.

In this parable, Jesus teaches us that our heavenly Father is not looking to condemn us or to find fault with us, but rather is a Merciful Father, who is looking for our return, ready to welcome and embrace us.
Even though we may be unfaithful to Him, God is always faithful to us. Our Father wants us to have the fullness of life in Himself.

The Parable of the Prodigal Son reminds us of the emptiness of leaving God, choosing our own way. The Lord wants to restore to us what is lost.  He is the One who runs to us, looking for the least opening in our hearts, so that He can welcome us back into the family.
Each time that we return to confess our sins and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, our Father accepts us back into the fold with more love than we can imagine.
Let us always turn to our Merciful Father, as He offers His love so freely to us.

The younger son was not only feeding the unclean pigs but he also wanted to eat what they were eating,  In the Jewish world, no one could get more lower than where this young man had reached in his sinful life.  But even that son was accepted by the compassionate father when he repented.  The son had, however, repented because he had reached a point of total despair.

However much we may have enjoyed living a sinful or ungodly life when times were good, it is only when we reach that desperate ‚Äúpig pen‚Äù experience that we realize we can be truly happy only in our Father‚Äôs house (the Church).

When we hear this parable, most of us get sentimental and conclude that, inspite of the conflicts, the father and sons united and they lived happily ever after.  But Jesus doesn‚Äôt conclude with a happy ending.  Jesus doesn‚Äôt even tell us what happened in the end.  And the Pharisees didn‚Äôt really get sentimental after hearing this parable.  On the contrary, they were offended (Luke 16:14-15).  Jesus was telling them that their image of God was wrong.

The prodigal younger son already had a fight with the father some months ago and left the house after taking his share.  Upon his return, when the father threw a party in celebration, it gave rise to a new conflict.

Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.

Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.
Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.
Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.

Jesus first told the people the parable of the lost sheep where the shepherd went out and brought it back (Luke 15:3-7).\
Next he told them about the parable of the lost coin where the owner of the house started looking for the coin all over the place until she found it (Luke 15:8-10).\
In this third parable Jesus talks about a rebellious son leaving the father‚Äôs home but nobody went to bring him back.
When the younger brother left his father‚Äôs house, a really good older brother would have assured the father ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry father, I will go and look for my brother and bring him back home even if it costs me my life‚Äù.\
After dividing the property, everything the father owned was now the property of the older son.  So when the father wanted to have a feast the older son had to pay the price for everything including the robe, the ring, the shoes and the feast.  For the younger son everything was free, but to take part in the feast, he had to repent and humble himself.

We, the human race, are like the younger brother, the prodigal son.  We needed an older brother to pay the price for our sins, so that we can take part in the feast (Mass /Eucharistic meal / Communion) with our Father without paying for anything.  But to take part in the feast, we, the younger ones, have to repent and humble ourselves first so that we can be in a state of grace before sharing in the Eucharistic meal / Communion (1 Corinthians 11:27).

The prodigal brother, unfortunately, got a Pharisee for an older brother.  But we are truly blessed because for us there is a true older brother and Jesus paid that price for us at the cost of his life, to protect us from the enemy so that we could come back to the Father‚Äôs House (the Church) and take part in the marriage supper of the Lamb (Communion).
On the Cross, Jesus paid a debt he did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay.  If we understood the depth of what Jesus did for us, it would melt us, move us and change our lives completely, and we would be true Christians.

Luke 16:8
*And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly;*
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewd response to the crisis.

*The children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.*
The Steward used material goods to gain friendship but the children of light (God's people) must use spiritual goods (love, peace, prayer, etc.) or sacrifice their material goods to gain friendship.
The Steward also forgave the people what they owed the master, like the priest who forgives the sinners who owe the heavenly Master an infinite debt when they sin.
Similarly, we too must forgive our offenders in order to gain their friendship and erase all enmity.

Luke 16:19-31
Lazarus went to the righteous side of Purgatory / Sheol / Hades, and thereafter to Heaven because he had gone through suffering when he was on the earth, and the rich man went to the unrighteous side of Purgatory, and thereafter to Hell because he had not shared his abundant blessings with Lazarus.\
The rich man had committed the sin of omission.

The rich man had neither murdered Lazarus, nor had he tortured Lazarus in any way. He had not even spoken a harsh word to Lazarus, and yet he was destined for eternal damnation (Hell).

Jesus again reminds us how important it is to be generous with the less fortunate ones.  But this time He tells us how serious it is if we neglect them.

Even if we have fulfilled all our religious obligations faithfully, God is first going to check whether or not we have been merciful towards our neighbor (Matthew 25:41-43).
If there are poor, needy and oppressed people around us, specially in our community, then it only means that we are not doing our duty as Christians.

The rich man symbolizes Israel‚Äôs failure to keep the old Covenant, and to heed the commandments of Moses and the prophets. Like the rich man and Israel, we too will lose our inheritance if we fail to give to the poor and needy.

It is not wrong to be rich.  But it is wrong if we don‚Äôt use our wealth to help the less fortunate ones.
We need to be good stewards of what God has given us while we focus on our holiness.
Sins of omission are as serious as sins of commission.

Separation or exile from God is what causes the people to burn in Hell because they do not possess the sanctifying grace which gives them the power to stand in the presence of God‚Äôs glory which stretches from Heaven to Hell.  Suffering on earth due to sins is only a small demonstration of Hell.

Jesus may have deliberately used the name "Lazarus" for the poor man, but did not name the rich man, because even after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38-44; Luke 16:31), the enemies of Jesus did not want to accept Jesus as the Messiah.  Instead, they were plotting to kill Lazarus because Jesus was becoming more popular after raising Lazarus from the dead (John 12:9-11).
