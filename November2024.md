### Wisdom is Beautiful

### Day 306 Wisdom defined

The word wisdom is understood as the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise. Someone could have wisdom about certain topics. However, the wisdom spoken about in the book of wisdom has a very deep meaning

For in her is a spirit
intelligent, holy, unique,
Manifold, subtle, agile,
clear, unstained, certain,
Never harmful, loving the good, keen,
23unhampered, beneficent, kindly,
Firm, secure, tranquil,
all-powerful, all-seeing,
And pervading all spirits,
though they be intelligent, pure and very subtle.
24For Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion,
and she penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity.
25 For she is a breath of the might of God. Wisdom 7:22-27

I seems like wisdom seems to be giving us a small sample of the nature of God. For wisdom is defined as holy, all-powerful, all-seeing which are also attributes of God.
So when we read the book of wisdom we should admire the deeper meaning when the author refers to wisdom.
We should take some time to sit down and pray ‚Äì possibly ponder of each of the below attributes of wisdom.

01. Spirit
02. Intelligent
03. Holy
04. Unique
05. Manifold
06. Subtle
07. Agile
08. Clear
09. Unstained
10. Certain
11. Never harmful
12. Loving the good
13. Keen
14. Unhampered
15. Beneficent
16. Kindly
17. Firm
18. Secure
19. Tranquil
20. all-powerful
21. all-seeing
22. pervading all spirits
23. Wisdom is mobile beyond all motion
24. penetrates and pervades all things by reason of her purity
25. breath of the might of God

As we ponder on these 25 attributes let us remember that we cannot define God or even understand his wisdom.

For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. 1 Cor 1:25

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God‚Äôs horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God‚Äôs power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord‚Äôs people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God‚Äôs horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know ‚Äì God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 308 By Cynthia Dsilva

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind;  And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us.  Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins.  Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.
