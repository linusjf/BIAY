[![In the Beginning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/CIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day001.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BW0gXbEVYgA "In the Beginning")

### Day1 *We have God in our DNA* - Michael Eltham ###

The Bible opens with this great scene of creation, it reveals a bit of God’s nature – God existed before all things and is the source of everything good, everything we know and understand. We see a glimpse of God’s nature, God is generous - keeps on creating and pouring life into this world. God creates an ordered and good world and puts everything in place and sets rules and boundaries. There is something to be learned from how God organized this world and set it in motion, we should also organize our lives, and set rules and boundaries based on the church's teachings and Sacred Scripture. When we live an organized, harmonious life we feel good, the reason being we were created by God in His own “image” and “likeness” – we experience wholeness when we have things in order.

Man and woman were created as the "crown of creation" – because we are created in God’s image and likeness.

26 Then God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; Gen 1:26

One important detail here is God said “Let us make humankind”, we have a Trinitarian God – God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not alone, but a harmonious community of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, they are in such beautiful unity that there is no strife or disagreement – but with one mind they all create this beautiful world.

We see a reference to the Holy Spirit, a wind from God, that is the breath of God – the Holy Spirit.

The Hebrew word "Ruach" means “wind,” “breath,” or “spirit.” The corresponding Greek word is pneuma. Both words are commonly used in passages referring to the Holy Spirit.

We see the power of the Word of God, with just one Word – things were created. The Word of God will have this effect on us as we study it every day in the Bible in a year program. It will create in us an orderly world, setting priorities right and we will end up living a harmonious life in union with the Holy Trinity.

God put his breath into us, and the Holy Spirit was put into our hearts.

then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. Gen 2:7

Since we are created in God’s image and likeness, we receive our good attributes and dignity from God. We have God’s nature in our DNA, and we naturally have love in our hearts, for Example, a mother naturally loves her newborn and does not need to be taught how to love.

It is at "creation" that the “dignity of life” is given to all human beings, that is why every human being has the dignity of life.

Every human being has the dignity of life because we are created in God’s image and likeness and God’s Spirit/breath was put into us. We should never discriminate based on skin color, race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, every single one in created in God’s image and likeness.

The explanation of the word “helper” helps to put things in perspective. God is called helper several times in the Bible and hence helper is not meant to be second class or someone who did menial tasks. Women and Men are both created equal in the image and likeness of God. Let us respect all human beings as everyone has the dignity of life and both men and women are equal. 

God does not have Gender – we cannot say that God is man or woman. We cannot even categorize God based on gender, God is our creator and He was even before Gender came into this world, God created gender when He made Adam – man and Eve – woman. When God was incarnate, He was born as a man for a reason. The reason is Jesus is the new Adam, and we the church is the new eve, created from Jesus’ side when his side was pierced. Blood and water flowed out, life-giving blood and water that gave birth to the new Eve – the Church.

Side Note: It will help us understand Genesis should if we did not read it chronologically or like a scientific book. Genesis does not aim to give a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe, it’s more like figurative language to describe real events.

That’s how the two events(Gen 1 and Gen 2) of the creation of man can be explained. Also things like “how God created light and darkness on day 1 and sun and moon on day 3”. It is best understood if we read it in figurative language.

Finally, we realize that God is the source of everything good, this should remind us to put him first in everything - He is the beginning. The Alpha and Omega.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 1 - creation - Irene ###

Something which struck me was 

1. God is our Creator. He made us we are his creation the work of his hands.

2. God is good.  Everything that He has created is good. 

3. He is our source and provider.  He has given us everything even before He made us.

4. God is our Helper our ever present help in every need.

5. He is a master planner putting every detail in place.

Our God is an awesome God 

Praise God the Father
Praise God the Son
Praise God the Holy Spirit the triune God.

### Day 1 - Gabriella ###

Praise God for Fr. Mike so beautifully explaining God's intention for us:
 
We are made in God's image and we were originally created for labour. 

As God freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. 

God is a creator so when he puts man and woman in the land he has them work. 

*The Lord God made us for labour and leisure. In  the creation story we see God working.*

He created the world in 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. God wants us to share in this, to labour,  till the land and keep it. 

And if God worked for 6 days and rested on the 7th we should follow suit.

Now I understand why my parents instilled in me: 
PRAY & WORK = ORA ET LABORA

God bless Fr. Mike for presenting the creation story so clearly. I didn't understand this in such detail before.

[![The Fall of Adam and Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/CIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WBg_xK44V0E "The Fall of Adam and Eve")

### Day2: *Distrust and Disobedience* - Michael Eltham ###

Man was made for communion with God, they spoke to God and heard God speak. It was a beautiful harmonious life, and everything was going great for Adam and Eve. As we read in the first chapter of the Catechism of the Catholic Church – God created man to share in the blessed life of the Trinity. Adam and Eve were enjoying this beautiful life – in direct communion with God.

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.CCC prologue 1

Now God has planted a garden in Eden and grew various plants with fruit that were pleasing to the eye and to eat. Adam was allowed to eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.” Gen 2:15-17

Satan is very crafty as we see in Genesis – he sows seeds of doubt in Eve’s heart. Satan tries to manipulate the truth and question it and eventually causes us to doubt the truth.

But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not die; 5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil.” Gen 3:4,5

Satan is proposing that God is a liar and that God does not want our good. According to satan, God didn’t want them to eat the fruit lest they become like God. This would have caused doubt in Eve’s heart. The serpent described in Genesis is no rat snake, it's more like a Dragon like creature – so there is also this element of fear that would have its role to play. Apart from doubt and fear satan eve was also fighting temptations.

So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise Gen 3:6

The fruit was also good to look at, good for the stomach and it made one like God.

She could not resist it anymore, the combined effect of doubt, fear, and temptation. She gave in and gave it to Adam as well, I would have expected Adam to at least resist – but it’s described as though he just eats it. (Like a good husband ;) – just joking ). Adam should have stood his ground and resisted the devil. 

The main thing that caused their fall was their distrust in God. God gave them everything – every tree, every creature and even let them share in His divine life. But they just could not trust God enough. This distrust caused their disobedience. This caused sin to enter mankind. 

We can sit and marvel at how stupid our first parents were, but pointing one finger at someone points 4 fingers back at us. Genesis is not a storybook to read and fall asleep over, it’s the story of our lives. We are faced with the same temptations that Adam and Eve faced, we have doubts, fear, and temptation in our lives.

God has given us the truth in the Word of God and from Church tradition, we know what we ought to do. Yet we doubt it, we fear the consequences, we fear what the world will say, and we give into the temptations of the world. We look at what’s good for the eye, good for the flesh, and pride ourselves in our wisdom.

The devil does not have his own clay, he just takes what God created and twists the truth into a lie. Satan will take half-truths and add lies to it and put doubt in our hearts, he is the father of lies.

“He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” Jh 8:44

We sometimes give into the lies of the enemy and give into the temptations of the world. When we commit sin we tend to hide like Adam and Eve we try to cover our sin up.

7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7

I feel this is the first penance that Adam and Eve took on because as we all know fig leaves cause itch. This would have caused severe itch for Adam and Eve when they made loincloths with these leaves. I’m sure they were aware of this but they felt so upset with themselves and fearful.

Loved Fr Mike’s explanation of the tone of God for the verse – “who told you you were naked?” The angry tone which most would assume compared to the sympathetic tone. God must have been really hurt - because we didn’t trust Him but believed the serpent instead.

Let us learn to trust God and his commandments. Man’s wisdom is foolishness to God, we should stop making up our own rules. If we decide that we can watch sports instead of worship on Sunday or that a fetus in the womb is just tissue – we are listening to the lies of satan. We should listen to God’s voice and trust God fully.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 2 – Alice To ###

Thoughts on action of Adam and the serpent:
1.	After creation, God has given Adam dominion over all animals (Gen 1:28). What Adam should have done when the serpent appeared before Eve was to rebuke it, protected Eve and cast the serpent out with his authority. Because of his inaction, Eve succumbed to temptation.
2.	The serpent is very clever. It did not do a direct onslaught. It just planted doubt in Eve’s mind by asking her a question. 
As a Christian, we should be aware of our God-given duty. We should always be aware of what our duty and mission is and adhere to it without fail or doubt because our God will not ask us to do things that we are not capable of and He will always be there to guide us along. We should also be aware that temptations, like the serpent will creep up on us without our being aware of it. We should always be vigilant. 
Pray each day for protection and guidance from the Holy Spirit and our Mama Mary.

### Day 2 By Cynthia D'Silva ###

Genesis 3:4-5 
*But the serpent said to the woman, “you will certainly not die.  God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, who knows good and evil.”* 
Satan did not change God’s word.  He cleverly twisted the Word and told Adam & Eve to look at God’s Word through his eyes.  
Instead of listening to the devil's interpretation of God’s Word, Eve should have consulted Adam, who knew better what commandment was given to him by God, and if Adam had any confusion he should have consulted his heavenly Father who gave him the commandment. 
We end up in the same situation when we try to interpret God’s Word on our own without guidance from those who have correct knowledge of the scriptures.

Genesis 3:15
*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.*
By this promise, God gave the guarantee of His divine assistance in protecting Mary and the Church (the Eucharist / the mystical Body of Christ) from Satan.  
By this promise it is evident that Mary and Jesus were immaculately conceived, that is, without original sin.  Mary’s holiness was confirmed by Angel Gabriel when he addressed Mary with the words "hail, full of grace” (“kecharitomene” in Greek) (Luke 1:28), which means that Mary was full of grace, like the first Eve before the fall.

[Genesis 3:22-24](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Genesis/3/22-24)

The Garden of Eden was a sanctuary / tabernacle where God dwelt with humans and Adam & Eve were told to leave the holy sanctuary because of the mortal sin which they both committed.
Mortal sin breaks our communion with God and results in “spiritual death” which means “eternal suffering (Hell) due to eternal separation from God.”
At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and ate the forbidden fruit, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).  
By this they instantly destroyed the divine life within them and consequently lost all the sanctifying graces which were necessary to perfect the human nature.  Thus they spiritually damaged and weakened the human soul, putting the human race in the power of Satan.  Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.  
The Church follows the same principle.
If we receive the fruit (Communion) from the tree of Life (the Cross) when we are in a state of mortal sin we will be subject to eternal damnation (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).  When we receive Communion in a state of grace we receive divine life which will give us eternal life after we leave this world (John 6:54).

[John 6:54](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/John/6/54)

### Jenita Maria ###

1. *God the provider, the most loving Father*

We understand that.. Even though adam and Eve went Against God's word, and completely disobeyed him, God still loved them through his anger and wrath where he curses them, he still holds them. He takes care of them, and helps them get through their life on earth, to be back with him again for eternity in holiness. 

2. *The importance of giving the first fruits to God*

Giving the first hours of your day Or the first fruits of earnings to God shows how much he means to you in your life. We are ever ready to do everything for the person we love, giving the first in everything!! But why should the last few hours or whatever is remaining out of all the abundance God gave us, be given to him back as a sacrifice of love. Love of God is pure and we can only respect God by giving what we love to him.
