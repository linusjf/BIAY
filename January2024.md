[![In the Beginning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day001.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BW0gXbEVYgA "In the Beginning")

### Day1 *We have God in our DNA* - Michael Eltham ###

The Bible opens with this great scene of creation, it reveals a bit of God‚Äôs nature ‚Äì God existed before all things and is the source of everything good, everything we know and understand. We see a glimpse of God‚Äôs nature, God is generous - keeps on creating and pouring life into this world. God creates an ordered and good world and puts everything in place and sets rules and boundaries. There is something to be learned from how God organized this world and set it in motion, we should also organize our lives, and set rules and boundaries based on the church's teachings and Sacred Scripture. When we live an organized, harmonious life we feel good, the reason being we were created by God in His own ‚Äúimage‚Äù and ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù ‚Äì we experience wholeness when we have things in order.

Man and woman were created as the "crown of creation" ‚Äì because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

26 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; Gen 1:26

One important detail here is God said ‚ÄúLet us make humankind‚Äù, we have a Trinitarian God ‚Äì God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not alone, but a harmonious community of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, they are in such beautiful unity that there is no strife or disagreement ‚Äì but with one mind they all create this beautiful world.

We see a reference to the Holy Spirit, a wind from God, that is the breath of God ‚Äì the Holy Spirit.

The Hebrew word "Ruach" means ‚Äúwind,‚Äù ‚Äúbreath,‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit.‚Äù The corresponding Greek word is pneuma. Both words are commonly used in passages referring to the Holy Spirit.

We see the power of the Word of God, with just one Word ‚Äì things were created. The Word of God will have this effect on us as we study it every day in the Bible in a year program. It will create in us an orderly world, setting priorities right and we will end up living a harmonious life in union with the Holy Trinity.

God put his breath into us, and the Holy Spirit was put into our hearts.

then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. Gen 2:7

Since we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness, we receive our good attributes and dignity from God. We have God‚Äôs nature in our DNA, and we naturally have love in our hearts, for Example, a mother naturally loves her newborn and does not need to be taught how to love.

It is at "creation" that the ‚Äúdignity of life‚Äù is given to all human beings, that is why every human being has the dignity of life.

Every human being has the dignity of life because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness and God‚Äôs Spirit/breath was put into us. We should never discriminate based on skin color, race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, every single one in created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

The explanation of the word ‚Äúhelper‚Äù helps to put things in perspective. God is called helper several times in the Bible and hence helper is not meant to be second class or someone who did menial tasks. Women and Men are both created equal in the image and likeness of God. Let us respect all human beings as everyone has the dignity of life and both men and women are equal. 

God does not have Gender ‚Äì we cannot say that God is man or woman. We cannot even categorize God based on gender, God is our creator and He was even before Gender came into this world, God created gender when He made Adam ‚Äì man and Eve ‚Äì woman. When God was incarnate, He was born as a man for a reason. The reason is Jesus is the new Adam, and we the church is the new eve, created from Jesus‚Äô side when his side was pierced. Blood and water flowed out, life-giving blood and water that gave birth to the new Eve ‚Äì the Church.

Side Note: It will help us understand Genesis should if we did not read it chronologically or like a scientific book. Genesis does not aim to give a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe, it‚Äôs more like figurative language to describe real events.

That‚Äôs how the two events(Gen 1 and Gen 2) of the creation of man can be explained. Also things like ‚Äúhow God created light and darkness on day 1 and sun and moon on day 3‚Äù. It is best understood if we read it in figurative language.

Finally, we realize that God is the source of everything good, this should remind us to put him first in everything - He is the beginning. The Alpha and Omega.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 1 - creation - Irene ###

Something which struck me was 

1. God is our Creator. He made us we are his creation the work of his hands.

2. God is good.  Everything that He has created is good. 

3. He is our source and provider.  He has given us everything even before He made us.

4. God is our Helper our ever present help in every need.

5. He is a master planner putting every detail in place.

Our God is an awesome God 

Praise God the Father
Praise God the Son
Praise God the Holy Spirit the triune God.

### Day 1 - Gabriella ###

Praise God for Fr. Mike so beautifully explaining God's intention for us:
 
We are made in God's image and we were originally created for labour. 

As God freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. 

God is a creator so when he puts man and woman in the land he has them work. 

*The Lord God made us for labour and leisure. In  the creation story we see God working.*

He created the world in 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. God wants us to share in this, to labour,  till the land and keep it. 

And if God worked for 6 days and rested on the 7th we should follow suit.

Now I understand why my parents instilled in me: 
PRAY & WORK = ORA ET LABORA

God bless Fr. Mike for presenting the creation story so clearly. I didn't understand this in such detail before.

[![The Fall of Adam and Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WBg_xK44V0E "The Fall of Adam and Eve")

### Day2: *Distrust and Disobedience* - Michael Eltham ###

Man was made for communion with God, they spoke to God and heard God speak. It was a beautiful harmonious life, and everything was going great for Adam and Eve. As we read in the first chapter of the Catechism of the Catholic Church ‚Äì God created man to share in the blessed life of the Trinity. Adam and Eve were enjoying this beautiful life ‚Äì in direct communion with God.

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.CCC prologue 1

Now God has planted a garden in Eden and grew various plants with fruit that were pleasing to the eye and to eat. Adam was allowed to eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, ‚ÄúYou may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.‚Äù Gen 2:15-17

Satan is very crafty as we see in Genesis ‚Äì he sows seeds of doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. Satan tries to manipulate the truth and question it and eventually causes us to doubt the truth.

But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not die; 5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

Satan is proposing that God is a liar and that God does not want our good. According to satan, God didn‚Äôt want them to eat the fruit lest they become like God. This would have caused doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. The serpent described in Genesis is no rat snake, it's more like a Dragon like creature ‚Äì so there is also this element of fear that would have its role to play. Apart from doubt and fear satan eve was also fighting temptations.

So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise Gen 3:6

The fruit was also good to look at, good for the stomach and it made one like God.

She could not resist it anymore, the combined effect of doubt, fear, and temptation. She gave in and gave it to Adam as well, I would have expected Adam to at least resist ‚Äì but it‚Äôs described as though he just eats it. (Like a good husband ;) ‚Äì just joking ). Adam should have stood his ground and resisted the devil. 

The main thing that caused their fall was their distrust in God. God gave them everything ‚Äì every tree, every creature and even let them share in His divine life. But they just could not trust God enough. This distrust caused their disobedience. This caused sin to enter mankind. 

We can sit and marvel at how stupid our first parents were, but pointing one finger at someone points 4 fingers back at us. Genesis is not a storybook to read and fall asleep over, it‚Äôs the story of our lives. We are faced with the same temptations that Adam and Eve faced, we have doubts, fear, and temptation in our lives.

God has given us the truth in the Word of God and from Church tradition, we know what we ought to do. Yet we doubt it, we fear the consequences, we fear what the world will say, and we give into the temptations of the world. We look at what‚Äôs good for the eye, good for the flesh, and pride ourselves in our wisdom.

The devil does not have his own clay, he just takes what God created and twists the truth into a lie. Satan will take half-truths and add lies to it and put doubt in our hearts, he is the father of lies.

‚ÄúHe was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù Jh 8:44

We sometimes give into the lies of the enemy and give into the temptations of the world. When we commit sin we tend to hide like Adam and Eve we try to cover our sin up.

7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7

I feel this is the first penance that Adam and Eve took on because as we all know fig leaves cause itch. This would have caused severe itch for Adam and Eve when they made loincloths with these leaves. I‚Äôm sure they were aware of this but they felt so upset with themselves and fearful.

Loved Fr Mike‚Äôs explanation of the tone of God for the verse ‚Äì ‚Äúwho told you you were naked?‚Äù The angry tone which most would assume compared to the sympathetic tone. God must have been really hurt - because we didn‚Äôt trust Him but believed the serpent instead.

Let us learn to trust God and his commandments. Man‚Äôs wisdom is foolishness to God, we should stop making up our own rules. If we decide that we can watch sports instead of worship on Sunday or that a fetus in the womb is just tissue ‚Äì we are listening to the lies of satan. We should listen to God‚Äôs voice and trust God fully.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 2 ‚Äì Alice To ###

Thoughts on action of Adam and the serpent:
1.	After creation, God has given Adam dominion over all animals (Gen 1:28). What Adam should have done when the serpent appeared before Eve was to rebuke it, protected Eve and cast the serpent out with his authority. Because of his inaction, Eve succumbed to temptation.
2.	The serpent is very clever. It did not do a direct onslaught. It just planted doubt in Eve‚Äôs mind by asking her a question. 
As a Christian, we should be aware of our God-given duty. We should always be aware of what our duty and mission is and adhere to it without fail or doubt because our God will not ask us to do things that we are not capable of and He will always be there to guide us along. We should also be aware that temptations, like the serpent will creep up on us without our being aware of it. We should always be vigilant. 
Pray each day for protection and guidance from the Holy Spirit and our Mama Mary.

### Day 2 By Cynthia D'Silva ###

Genesis 3:4-5 
*But the serpent said to the woman, ‚Äúyou will certainly not die.  God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, who knows good and evil.‚Äù* 
Satan did not change God‚Äôs word.  He cleverly twisted the Word and told Adam & Eve to look at God‚Äôs Word through his eyes.  
Instead of listening to the devil's interpretation of God‚Äôs Word, Eve should have consulted Adam, who knew better what commandment was given to him by God, and if Adam had any confusion he should have consulted his heavenly Father who gave him the commandment. 
We end up in the same situation when we try to interpret God‚Äôs Word on our own without guidance from those who have correct knowledge of the scriptures.

Genesis 3:15
*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.*
By this promise, God gave the guarantee of His divine assistance in protecting Mary and the Church (the Eucharist / the mystical Body of Christ) from Satan.  
By this promise it is evident that Mary and Jesus were immaculately conceived, that is, without original sin.  Mary‚Äôs holiness was confirmed by Angel Gabriel when he addressed Mary with the words "hail, full of grace‚Äù (‚Äúkecharitomene‚Äù in Greek) (Luke 1:28), which means that Mary was full of grace, like the first Eve before the fall.

[Genesis 3:22-24](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Genesis/3/22-24)

The Garden of Eden was a sanctuary / tabernacle where God dwelt with humans and Adam & Eve were told to leave the holy sanctuary because of the mortal sin which they both committed.
Mortal sin breaks our communion with God and results in ‚Äúspiritual death‚Äù which means ‚Äúeternal suffering (Hell) due to eternal separation from God.‚Äù
At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and ate the forbidden fruit, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).  
By this they instantly destroyed the divine life within them and consequently lost all the sanctifying graces which were necessary to perfect the human nature.  Thus they spiritually damaged and weakened the human soul, putting the human race in the power of Satan.  Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.  
The Church follows the same principle.
If we receive the fruit (Communion) from the tree of Life (the Cross) when we are in a state of mortal sin we will be subject to eternal damnation (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).  When we receive Communion in a state of grace we receive divine life which will give us eternal life after we leave this world (John 6:54).

[1 Corinthians 11:27-29](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/1Corinthians/11/27-29)

[John 6:54](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/John/6/54)

### Jenita Maria ###

1. *God the provider, the most loving Father*

We understand that.. Even though adam and Eve went Against God's word, and completely disobeyed him, God still loved them through his anger and wrath where he curses them, he still holds them. He takes care of them, and helps them get through their life on earth, to be back with him again for eternity in holiness. 

2. *The importance of giving the first fruits to God*

Giving the first hours of your day Or the first fruits of earnings to God shows how much he means to you in your life. We are ever ready to do everything for the person we love, giving the first in everything!! But why should the last few hours or whatever is remaining out of all the abundance God gave us, be given to him back as a sacrifice of love. Love of God is pure and we can only respect God by giving what we love to him.

### Day3: Walking with the Lord - Michael Eltham ###

It is so important for us to have a relationship with God. We are not saved just by being baptized or with church membership or by inheritance - it also depends on how we live our lives.

We all know what Cain did, and how he sinned. Now Adam and Even had another child Seth who is made in Adam‚Äôs image and likeness ‚Äì and Adam was made in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth Gen 5:3

These are the two lines of Adam‚Äôs family Setithe line and Cainite line. The Cainite line seems to be doing evil and the Setithe line are doing good. Even though they are both from the same parent Adam and Eve and grew up in the same home - they turned out so differently. Just being part of a family will not make us good, we have to work hard to become good children as well. We need to teach our children to be good as well.

Now Enoch is a good example from the Setithe line who was good and walked with God. Enoch is the first human being who did not die because he walked so closely with God.

22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. 24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him. Gen 3:22-23

God must have been so close to Enoch that he let him live a long life of 365 years. Enoch apparently did the will of God and probably didn‚Äôt commit many sins. He was so close to God that God didn‚Äôt even let him die, he just took him up out of the earth. Well, how to we know that the verse didn‚Äôt just mean he died and God took him.

Some evidence can be found in Sirach and Hebrews.



ENOCH walked with the LORD and was taken, that succeeding generations might learn by his example. Sirach 44:16



Few on earth have been created like ENOCH; he also was taken up bodily. Sirach 49:14

By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: ‚ÄúHe could not be found, because God had taken him away.‚Äù Heb 11:5

We need to walk with the Lord and not be confirmed to the standards of the world, we should renew our minds with the Word of God.

In this corrupt and sinful world, we need to walk with the Lord as Enoch and Noah did.

Let us be the salt of the world and the light of the world.

May we not just do as the world does but live as God wants us to live, in the world but not of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè


### Day-3 Name: Anonymous ###

God is saying, Noah,  make this ark.  Because u clinged to  me, I will lift you up.

### Day 3 By Cynthia Dsilva ###

Genesis 5:24
*After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for 300 years.  His whole lifetime was 365 years, then he was no more, because God took him.* 
Enoch had an encounter with God when he was 65 years old.  Thereafter, for the rest of his life he walked with God.  Enoch was not a monk.  He was an ordinary family man.  Enoch did not have any scriptures or Temple or Church to guide him and yet he was able to walk with God.  If Enoch could do it then it should not be difficult for us to walk with God when we have the scriptures and the Church to guide us.

Genesis 6:5-7
*The Lord saw that the people had become wicked and evil.   So the Lord said, ‚ÄúI will wipe out from the earth all the human beings I have created.‚Äù*
After God had already declared to Satan that He would put enmity between Satan and the woman (Genesis 3:15), Satan tried to destroy God's plan for redemption by tempting men and women to lead immoral & sinful lives and therefore God had to send the Great Flood and destroy all humanity except Noah and his family because Noah was found to be righteous.

[![The Flood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day004.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k4ksCrLNO2U "The Flood")

### Day 4 *Why does God allow evil in the world?* - Michael Eltham ###

We read how Noah - who walked with God, also listened and did what the Lord commanded him to do. Even though the people around him were doing evil things, Noah did what was right and listened to the instructions of the Lord. Noah built a huge ark according to the detailed instructions from the Lord. Then the Lord asked Noah to take in two of each species of animal.

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him. Gen 6:22

Noah did not care about what the people were talking about him, he did not bother about their opinion. He just did the will of God and listened to the instructions God gave him, even if it seemed foolish or made no sense. Why build a big ark when there was never a flood before or there was no heavy rain? Imagine storing food for a lot of animals and getting them to come into the ark.

People would have laughed at him, but Noah did everything the Lord told him.

We are called to be not only hearers of the word but doers as well (James 1:22~). Also from Mat 7: Everyone who hears the word and does it is a wise man who built his house upon the rock - the rain and the flood did not cause the house to fall.

Noah was a hearer and a doer of the word as well, which is why the water did not destroy him and his family.

Water is used to cleanse things and the great flood wiped out all the evil generation. Only Noah and his family were saved. Because Noah listened to God‚Äôs word and acted upon it, he became a blessing to his family.

We need to be hearers and doers of God's word like Noah. Even if it is at the cost of the whole city laughing at us.

We use water to clean regular things and also used for baptism. John the Baptist called people to be baptized by water in order to prepare for Jesus‚Äôs coming. When Jesus was baptized in the river of Jordan, he was not cleansed by the water but the water was cleansed by Jesus‚Äôs divine touch. The next time we dip our fingers in holy water let us remember that it cleanses us, it‚Äôs sacramental. Just as the flood waters cleansed the human race at a point like John the Baptist baptized in water to prepare us for Jesus, and just as blood and ‚Äúwater‚Äù poured out of the side of Jesus for the purification of the Church. We were baptized and made clean ‚Äì grafted into the body of Christ, the Church.

The image to remember is the Rainbow, it‚Äôs the promise that God made to Noah and to each one of us that He will never destroy us again.

‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. Gen 8:21

I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù 17 God said to Noah, ‚ÄúThis is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù Gen 9: 3-17

The Rainbow is symbolic of God putting down his bow and deciding to never ever destroy us. This is an answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy does God allow evil in the world?‚Äù God is patient and will not act harshly to destroy all evil people. God is patient and hopes that even the evilest people will repent.

God re-established the covenant that he had with Adam, he makes a new covenant with Noah and blesses them ‚ÄúGod blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.‚Äù Gen 9:1

One would think that humans would learn from their mistakes, but no we keep on failing and breaking the covenant over and over again through generations. God did not just destroy all mankind but loved us even more, and sent Jesus ‚Äì His only begotten son.

God will not destroy us but love us more, love us until we repent and turn to Him. Let us not hurt God too much, return to His arms.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 4 Anonymous ###

1. The foundation between God and man is interwoven with reminder of God's gift of human life.  God forbids murder of man.

2. God says you can eat of the animals.  Animals are God 's creatures.  God entrusted animals to the stewardship of human beings.  And it is contrary to human dignity to be cruel to them.  This is an issue which troubled me a lot, when I saw humans attacking animals mercilessly.   

3. God loves His creation and creatures and we have to be obedient to His commandments. We should never question His ways because He created us and He knows  what is best for us.  I seek pardon for the times I have knowingly or unknowingly questioned.God, why He created animals to suffer at human hands?
All Glory  to The Most Holy Trinity!

Genesis 7:1
Noah started building the ark 100 years before the flood started and not when it started to drizzle or rain.  When God said ‚Äúget in‚Äù Noah was so ready.
How ready are we if God says tomorrow ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come home?‚Äù
Are we ready or would we start running around looking for a priest to make our last confession?
We must be ready for eternal lie every day of our earthly life, by being in a state of grace at all times with regular Confession and Communion.

[![Tower of Babel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day005.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nBoRts9y6Ko "Tower of Babel")

### Day 5: *Let us make a name for ourselves* - Michael Eltham ###

Who does not want a good name for themselves, everyone wants the world to love them. We try to be first in sports, business, entertainment, or any field. Now there is no harm in excellence or making a name. But the problem comes when we say ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù or ‚Äúwe did it‚Äù and we take all the credit. We tend to forget that before we could do anything God had to create us and create the world so we have things to create with. Right from the start Adam and Eve wanted to become like God, at least that was the temptation the serpent threw at them.

‚ÄúFor God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5

Satan and the 1/3rd angels fell probably due to the same reason of wanting to be like God.

This tendency to become like God seems to lift its ugly head again in the tower of Babel.

Then they said, ‚ÄúCome, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.‚ÄùGen 11:4

God's grace and mercy are revealed when God came down to confuse their languages. God knew that even if they built a tower into the heavens and reached their highest levels of success they will still not be satisfied. Pride will never be satisfied, it will lead to greed. That is why we see the people who are trying to build a name for themselves will never be satisfied, they will go to any length to reach the top. Once they have reached a good level of success they will not feel satisfied and go into depression.

As St Augustine said - Our hearts will find rest only when we rest in the Lord. Even if we excel in our field of music, art, science, business or any field we will not be satisfied if we are trying to make a name for ourselves. But if lives are rooted in God and we are focused on lifting the name of the Lord higher, we will be blessed beyond our imagination.

We are all called to greatness. To be great saints, we ought to have that as our top priority as St Maximillian Kolbe did. However, it should be for the glory of the Lord and not for our self-interest or our glory.

Let John the Baptist's prayer be our prayer today "He must increase and I must decrease.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

*"Choosing excellence over power, pride and fame"*

### Day-5 Anonymous ###

Nimrod -the mighty hunter before The Lord, his quest for ambition, power and control, for self-glory. 

Forgetting they were created by God. they were planning to build the Tower of Babel and since they were all speaking the same language, it was much easier for them to plan.  Thus forgetting they had a Creator who was watching their every move. And rightly God comes down n scatters them all.  Their plan could not be established.

That being who we are, being what God wants us to be and being that person well.  That gives Glory to God.

Let our only aim be to Glorify our Creator,  who will always lift us up.

### Day6: Our struggle with faith - Michael Eltham ###

We read about Job today, he seems like someone who is living a good life ‚Äì got his priorities right, worships God, and is a good family man. If Gold is tested in the furnace, man is tested with problems, sufferings, trials, and temptations. God allows certain trials in the life of Job, for testing and purification.

God permits satan to take Job‚Äôs possessions, his livestock, property and children all at once.

Then Satan answered the Lord, ‚ÄúDoes Job fear God for nothing? 10 Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 11 But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.‚Äù 12 The Lord said to Satan, ‚ÄúVery well, all that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him!‚Äù So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord. Job 1:9-12.



On seeing the statue of Mother Mary in my home the HVAC contractor struck up a conversation with me about religion, he stopped going to church after he lost his wife to cancer. His wife was a devout catholic and did nothing wrong her whole life, he asked ‚Äúwhy would God want to give such a good person cancer?‚Äù. Well, we may never know the reason why we are given so many sufferings in life, but we need to rely on the fact that God is in control and we face sufferings for our spiritual growth. Most people would curse God and stop praying if they lost their job, property and kids. But this caused Job to worship God.



20 Then Job arose, tore his robe, shaved his head, and fell on the ground and worshiped. 21 He said, ‚ÄúNaked I came from my mother‚Äôs womb, and naked shall I return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.‚ÄùJob 1:20-21

We need to learn an attitude toward losing something. Job said the Lord gave the Lord took it away. Let us learn to be thankful in every situation. Even if there are multiple things going wrong in our lives we should continue to entrust ourselves to the Lord. Just continue to pray and know that God is good, even if we have many misfortunes in life. For the Lord will restore everything in our lives and even multiply our blessings if we trust Him. This song drives the point home.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

[![God's Covenant with Abram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day007.jpg)](https://youtu.be/up30wE2u-AI "God's Covenant with Abram")

### Day7: *What‚Äôs the difference between a contract and a covenant?* - Michael Eltham ###

A contract is an agreement for the exchange of goods and services however a covenant is the exchange of person itself - I belong to you and you belong to me. That is why a marriage is not a contract but a covenant, not the exchange of goods but the giving of oneself to the other.

The word of the Lord came to Abram, that he will be receive a great reward. He was promised children as great as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Abram had faith and knew that even though he was getting old and had no children, God would provide. But sometimes Abram had questions.

But Abram said, ‚ÄúLord GOD, what can you give me, if I die childless and have only a servant of my household, Eliezer of Damascus?‚Äù

3Abram continued, ‚ÄúLook, you have given me no offspring, so a servant of my household will be my heir.‚Äù Gen 15:2,3

The Lord answered Abram with a covenant promise.

He answered him: Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

10He brought him all these, split them in two, and placed each half opposite the other; but the birds he did not cut up.

12As the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great, dark dread descended upon him.

13 Then the LORD said to Abram: Know for certain that your descendants will reside as aliens in a land not their own, where they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.

14But I will bring judgment on the nation they must serve, and after this they will go out with great wealth.

15You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace; you will be buried at a ripe old age.

16In the fourth generation  your descendants will return here, for the wickedness of the Amorites is not yet complete.

17When the sun had set and it was dark, there appeared a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch, which passed between those pieces.

18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Great River, the Euphrates,

19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,

20the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

21the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. Gen 15:10-21

Just trying to visualize the scene can uplift our spirits. Although it may seem strange how God asked Abram to bring the three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon there has to be a deeper meaning to it related to the prescribed sacrifices. The beauty of God speaking visually was incredible how the sunset caused a smoking pot and flaming torch to pass through the two pieces. Following this, the Lord made a covenant with Abram and gave him a timeline of events of his life and his descendants.

We may have our own questions and doubts about our life and we should. We should battle with our questions and seek the Lord for answers. Questions and doubts may cause us to be anxious and worried. It is okay to have questions and concerns but we should not despair.

We should remember God‚Äôs promises to us and not be afraid or anxious about anything. God‚Äôs promise to never destroy mankind again with a flood, His promise to never leave us or abandon us, His promise to be with us always till the end of days, His promise that we will never be in want, His promise of protecting, His promise to anoint us head with oil, His promise for a Savior, His promise that he will prepare a place for us in his Father‚Äôs House, His promise to send us the Holy Spirit - our helper, our advocate and counselor, the List goes on and on. Let us not fear - but trust in Our faithful God.

Let us remember that God has made a covenant with us to save us, so have no fear.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day8: *Taking things into our own hands* - Michael Eltham ###

Patience, Perseverance, Faith, Trust, Hope are a few words the sprung up when I heard the word spoken to us today.

We know that God made a covenant with Abram, that his descendants would be as many as the stars in the sky and they would conquer the lands for many generations. But both Abram and Sarai are getting older and there seem to be no signs of children.

Thus, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, his wife Sarai took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

4He had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant. As soon as Hagar knew she was pregnant, her mistress lost stature in her eyes.

5 So Sarai said to Abram: ‚ÄúThis outrage against me is your fault. I myself gave my maid to your embrace; but ever since she knew she was pregnant, I have lost stature in her eyes. May the LORD decide between you and me!‚Äù Gen 16:3-5

Sarai gets impatient and takes things into her own hands - makes Abram follow her plan and gets mad at him all within few verses. She suggests the Abram would have children with Hagar the maid. Like a good husband üòÖ Abram listens to his wife. We see how things go south very fast.

The lesson here is nothing good comes out of taking things into our own hands - we need to wait on the Lord, no matter how long it takes. Like in the story of Job where he is surrounded by friends who keep accusing him. Job just wants a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on. Let us be slow to speak and quick to listen

Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. James 1:19-20

May be we need to become better listeners as many people just want to be heard in this world today.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 8 By Cynthia Dsilva ###

Genesis 17:12
*Why did babies have to be circumcised on the 8th day?*
God created the world in 6 days and consecrated it on the 7th day, but the first creation could not achieve its goal because sin entered it and the first Covenant was not renewable. 

Therefore, circumcision was a foreshadow of the new creation which started on the 8th day of the first creation (Easter Sunday) when Jesus discarded His mortal flesh (the flesh of the first Adam) and received His own immortal flesh.

Circumcision was also a fore shadow of baptism which makes us new creations because we discard our old sinful selves and enter the new Covenant which started on the 8th day of the first creation.  

In the old Covenant, a circumcised man had an obligation to ensure that all his male descendants were circumcised. 

Since baptism replaced circumcision, in the new Covenant, baptized parents have an obligation to ensure that all their descendants are baptized. 

When a child is baptized, he/she receives the family name (surname) of the earthly father and thus becomes a member if his family.  And simultaneously, the child also becomes a member if our heavenly Father‚Äôs family.

Genesis 17:15-16
After the fall of the first king (Adam) and queen (Eve) God was waiting to re-establish His Kingdom on earth.  But God was not just interested in working with a man alone.  When God stepped up to re-establish His Covenant, He gave us a hint of His plan for the monarchy of His Kingdom by moving from Adam to Abraham, and from Eve to Sarah, because Sarah‚Äôs womb would bear the earthly son of the promise who would be the ancestor of kings and queens.
The future Davidic kingdom was, therefore, to be a restoration of what God had established in the creation kingdom.

[![Sodom and Gomorrah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day009.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0P7pyHLz0CY "Sodom and Gomorrah")

### Day9: *Abraham is a good model for intercessory prayer.* - Michael Eltham ###

The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were committing grave sins and they were going to be destroyed. Abraham starts pleading with the Lord to save those people.

Then Abraham drew near and said: ‚ÄúWill you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

24Suppose there were fifty righteous people in the city; would you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people within it?

25Far be it from you to do such a thing, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike! Far be it from you! Should not the judge of all the world do what is just?‚Äù

26The LORD replied: If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.

27Abraham spoke up again: ‚ÄúSee how I am presuming to speak to my Lord, though I am only dust and ashes!

28What if there are five less than fifty righteous people? Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?‚Äù I will not destroy it, he answered, if I find forty-five there.

29But Abraham persisted, saying, ‚ÄúWhat if only forty are found there?‚Äù He replied: I will refrain from doing it for the sake of the forty.

30Then he said, ‚ÄúDo not let my Lord be angry if I go on. What if only thirty are found there?‚Äù He replied: I will refrain from doing it if I can find thirty there.

31Abraham went on, ‚ÄúSince I have thus presumed to speak to my Lord, what if there are no more than twenty?‚Äù I will not destroy it, he answered, for the sake of the twenty.

32But he persisted: ‚ÄúPlease, do not let my Lord be angry if I speak up this last time. What if ten are found there?‚Äù For the sake of the ten, he replied, I will not destroy it.

33The LORD departed as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned home. Gen 18:23-33

Just reading the episode is a good lesson on Intercessory prayer. We see how Abraham pleads on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah, he calls on the mercy of God. He knows that the people were sinful but he also knew that God‚Äôs Mercy is far greater than their sin. Abraham was able to eventually save Lot and his daughters. Remember God hears the prayer of a righteous man. We need to be Intercessors and prayer worriers - praying for our world. Let us not give up but persistently pray for God to hear our prayers. Even if we have to pray for people who do not deserve God‚Äôs love, we should pray with all our zeal and trust in God‚Äôs mercy and grace.

Lot‚Äôs daughters get desperate and commit a grave sin.

The firstborn said to the younger: ‚ÄúOur father is getting old, and there is not a man in the land to have intercourse with us as is the custom everywhere.

Come, let us ply our father with wine and then lie with him, that we may ensure posterity by our father.‚Äù Gen 19:31,32

This is how they both conceived children from their own father.

Lessons to be learned from Lot‚Äôs daughters - they thought that there were no more men in the world and they had to have children from their own father- the Bible does not call it out as a sin but ‚Äúshows it a sin‚Äù and a big mistake, as the descendants of the two sons born became the Moabites and the Ammonites. The two big enemies of the Israelites.

We should learn a life lesson from this, never get over anxious and think that our world is upset down, there is no way out, no solution etc - we tend to make big mistakes when we are guided by fear and anxiety. Let us intercede instead and pray for the situation, knowing that God will make a way. 

May we trust in the Lord always.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 9 - Jenita ###

Not every problem that we go through has an answer at the end.. We may wonder why we faced those problems even when we have been good and righteous like Job. 

But even when such doubts arise it is important to know that the journey is important.. And with whom that journey is made is a little more important. 

God is faithful, he will spare the wicked for the sake of the innocent. 

What a merciful God we serve üôèüèº

### Day10: *God will protect us even if when we mess up.* - Michael Eltham ###

We usually idealize people in the Bible and assume that they always had faith and never doubted. Our father in Faith Abraham himself failed. He lies about Sarah being his sister for fear of them taking her away. Abraham acted out of fear instead of faith.

From there Abraham journeyed on to the region of the Negeb, where he settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he resided in Gerar as an alien,

2Abraham said of his wife Sarah, ‚ÄúShe is my sister.‚Äù So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent and took Sarah.

3But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him: You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she has a husband.

4Abimelech, who had not approached her, said: ‚ÄúO Lord, would you kill an innocent man?

5Was he not the one who told me, ‚ÄòShe is my sister‚Äô? She herself also stated, ‚ÄòHe is my brother.‚Äô I acted with pure heart and with clean hands.‚Äù

6 God answered him in the dream: Yes, I know you did it with a pure heart. In fact, it was I who kept you from sinning against me; that is why I did not let you touch her.

7So now, return the man‚Äôs wife so that he may intercede for you, since he is a prophet,  that you may live. If you do not return her, you can be sure that you and all who are yours will die.

8Early the next morning Abimelech called all his servants and informed them of everything that had happened, and the men were filled with fear. Gen 18:1-8

God intervened and saved Abraham and Sarah, they were blessed with land and money.

Sometimes we may get afraid and lie or commit sin out of fear.

We should not give up easily because God will save us.

Even though we are weak He is strong, even though we fail He is faithful to uphold us.

St Paul was troubled by a thorn in his flesh and asked God to take it away. However, the Lord answered - Strength is made perfect in weakness, My grace is sufficient for you. Do not be disheartened or discouraged the Lord is on our side.

If He is for us what can be against us.

Jesus came into the world not to condemn us but to save us. Let us be strengthened and be reassured that the Lord will pick us up when we fall.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 10: Reflection  (Chapter 20) By Joice Pereira ###

11‚ÄúAbraham replied, ‚ÄúI said to myself, ‚ÄòThere is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.‚Äô

Abraham and Sarah settled in  Gerar on the way to Negeb while, there, Abraham pretended that Sarah was his sister, and King Abimelech of Gerar took Sarah for himself. But God wants Abimelech in a dream that he will die if he approaches Sarah, he must return Sarah to Abraham, who is a prophet and will pray for him. Abimelech did fear God. All it took was a dream and he was immediately to do what was right. 

The Bible reveals that Job was a man who ‚Äúfeared God ‚Äú. Job lost his children, wealth, and health but in it all, he never spoke disrespectfully about God. We read that in all this, Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.

Fear of the Lord will keep us from sin. All kinds of good will flow into the life of the person who fears the Lord.

[![The Sacrifice of Isaac](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day011.jpg)](https://youtu.be/51FQLxXX5Rw "The Sacrifice of Isaac")

### Day11: *God is always on time. * - Michael Eltham ###

Faith on display, Abraham is called the Father of Faith because he trusted the Lord, to the extent of losing the thing Abraham loved the most, his son. Isaac was the promise of God and the only hope for Abraham to have descendants as many as the stars in the sky and sand on the seashore.

Some time afterward, God put Abraham to the test and said to him: Abraham! ‚ÄúHere I am!‚Äù he replied.

2Then God said: Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There offer him up as a burnt offering on one of the heights that I will point out to you.

3Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey, took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac, and after cutting the wood for the burnt offering, set out for the place of which God had told him.

Gen 22:1-3

If I was Abraham I would not have not got any sleep that night knowing that I would have to sacrifice my son the next day.

So Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two walked on together,

7Isaac spoke to his father Abraham. ‚ÄúFather!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHere I am,‚Äù he replied. Isaac continued, ‚ÄúHere are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?‚Äù

8‚ÄúMy son,‚Äù Abraham answered, ‚ÄúGod will provide the sheep for the burnt offering.‚Äù Then the two walked on together.Gen 22: 6-8

Isaac carrying the wood up the mount is a prefiguration of Jesus carrying the wood of the cross up Calvary. Isaac‚Äôs question ‚ÄúHere are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?‚Äù would have broken Abraham‚Äôs heart. I admire Abraham‚Äôs faith here when he said that God will provide.

When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he bound his son Isaac, and put him on top of the wood on the altar.

10Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son. Gen 22:9-10

Even though Isaac was in his 30s and was able to overpower his father and run away. He decided to trust his father. Just how Jesus prayed for the cup of suffering to be taken away, but not His will but the will of the Father be done. We need to cultivate this bond of trust with the Father. We need to know that God has plans for us not to harm us, but for our welfare. Even though we may not see it, we need to trust him.

But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, ‚ÄúAbraham, Abraham!‚Äù ‚ÄúHere I am,‚Äù he answered.

12‚ÄúDo not lay your hand on the boy,‚Äù said the angel. ‚ÄúDo not do the least thing to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you did not withhold from me your son, your only one.

Abraham‚Äôs faith was tested and he passed. God was only testing Abraham to see if he really loved God. Abba Father would have know how Abraham was feeling for God knows everything the past, present and future. Abba Father‚Äôs heart would have broken when Jesus died on the cross for us.

Abraham knew that God who created everything out of nothing can even bring his son back to life, so he was willing to sacrifice Isaac. We all know the story how a ram was found in the bushes and Abraham sacrificed it.

Pondering today‚Äôs scripture a question that I asked myself was would I do it - would I be ready to sacrifice my son?? I came up with a big "No".

We should take some time to sit down and see what our attachments are? Pray that we choose God above everything else.

Abraham was a great man - hoping against hope he trusted the Lord and the Lord blessed him with a son who had much faith in his father.

For faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see(Heb11:1). We need to remember what God said ‚ÄúFor my thoughts are not your thoughts,

neither are your ways my ways," (Isaiah 55:8).

Just trust Him and have faith that He is in control of everything, even though the situation seems hopeless. God‚Äôs timing is perfect and God will always step in just in time. So do not give up even if everything seems lost, just trust in Him and God will provide.

Lord, I trust in you ‚Äì I am also Hoping against Hope.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

The verse which truly makes Abraham justified in the eyes of God is "*Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship and then we will come back to you "*

And in another line 22:8 (When Isaac asks Abraham) "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the Lamb for the sacrifice?" *Abraham replies "God himself will provide the lamb for the sacrifice."

Abraham believed that God will make him a great nation and God's constant assurance that only through Isaac that God's covenant will be established.
Abraham never doubted God's word (the above highlighted verses is the Faith that Abraham has in God).

Galatians 2:6 St. Paul writes about the faith of Abraham "Remember Abraham: he believed God and because of this was held to be a just man"

### Day12: *Dedication to daily devotion and work.* - Michael Eltham ###

The story of Isaac and Rebekah seems so smooth and as though they had a full revelation of God‚Äôs plan for their lives. But it was not so - it only seems so to the readers of their story.

Abraham commissioned his servant to go find a bride from among his own people (Israelites, relatives) as they were staying in pagan land. The servant prayed the below prayer.

While I stand here at the spring and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water,

14if I say to a young woman, ‚ÄòPlease lower your jug, that I may drink,‚Äô and she answers, ‚ÄòDrink, and I will water your camels, too,‚Äô then she is the one whom you have decided upon for your servant Isaac. In this way I will know that you have dealt graciously with my master.‚Äù Gen 24:13-14

Until the day when Abraham's servant went in search of a bride, Rebekah was doing her mundane tasks of fetching water from the well. We heard the story she kindly gave a drink to servant and his camels. She was willing to even go with the servant to a far off place to meet Isaac.

One day toward evening he went out to walk in the field, and caught sight of camels approaching. Gen 24:63

Until the day the servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac would go to the fields to meditate and pray. Walk in the field can be related to praising God like God walked with Adam and even in the garden of Eden. "In the evening" is a time of rest when the day‚Äôs work is done and one turns to worship.

Sometimes while waiting for God to answer our prayer, we get impatience and complain and crib about the situation. Like Job we don't see God's providence working in our lives - we only see all the problems and misfortunes in our life. We even wonder why this is happening to me.

We are called to persevere in prayer like Isaac, daily drawing from the well - like Rebekah, we need to draw from the well of the Sacraments - Eucharist, Confession, the Bible, personal prayer, community prayer.

Even if we don't understand what‚Äôs going on like Job, we need to keep on doing the right thing and the Lord will provide. We will see at the end of the book of Job, how the Lord provides - much more than what Job initially had.

But for now, we need to keep journeying with Job and feel the pain and struggle.

Let's keep trusting in God's providence.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 12 Anonymous ### 

God's providence is always at work.
How powerfully we rely on God's providence, even when we don't see.
God is faithful, even when we are unfaithful and He provides.

### Day 12 - Jenita ###

God sends the right people at the right time and at the right place in our lives. 

We only need to tell him our hearts desires and he will make wonders according to his will in our lives. 

He only wants us to trust the e tire process 

"One foot forward" 
 
This is all we need to do..  Trust and serve God even on the dark days, know that he is there even when we are in the darkness. 

*Trust the process*

### Day 12 Anonymous ###

God's providence is always at work.
How powerfully we rely on God's providence, even when we don't see.
God is faithful, even when we are unfaithful and He provides.

[![Esau Sells His Birthright](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day013.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Tg5f77arXqQ "Esau Sells His Birthright")

### Day13 Selling our inheritance for temporal pleasure ###

Isaac and Rebecca were happily married but they did not have any children. God had promised Abraham descendants as many as the stars in the sky so it‚Äôs really important that Isaac has children. Although Abraham had children with Hagar his servant and other concubines, the lineage for Jesus should come through Abraham and Isaac. As we journey through the Bible we will see how the lineage is established from Adam to Jesus.

We will see how Isaac‚Äôs son Jacob will have 12 sons who‚Äôs descendants will become the 12 tribes of Israel.

Isaac entreated the LORD on behalf of his wife, since she was sterile. The LORD heard his entreaty, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.

But the children jostled each other in the womb so much that she exclaimed, ‚ÄúIf it is like this, why go on living!‚Äù She went to consult the LORD,

23and the LORD answered her:

Two nations are in your womb, two peoples are separating while still within you;

But one will be stronger than the other,

and the older will serve the younger. Gen 25:21-23

Right from conception the situation seems like the twins will always be at odds, jostling each other, one is stronger and one older will serve the younger. Even at birth, we see the younger one Jacob holding on to the heel of Esau.

The first to emerge was reddish, and his whole body was like a hairy mantle; so they named him Esau.

26Next his brother came out, gripping Esau‚Äôs heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born. Gen 25: 25-26

Esau was a good hunter and Jacob was a simple man, Rebecca preferred Jacob and Isaac Esau because he was fond of the game he caught.

Once, when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.

30He said to Jacob, ‚ÄúLet me gulp down some of that red stuff; I am famished.‚Äù That is why he was called Edom.

31But Jacob replied, ‚ÄúFirst sell me your right as firstborn.‚Äù

32‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Esau, ‚ÄúI am on the point of dying. What good is the right as firstborn to me?‚Äù

33But Jacob said, ‚ÄúSwear to me first!‚Äù So he sold Jacob his right as firstborn under oath.

Gen 25:29-33

Esau did not regard his firstborn right too much which is why he sold it a meal. Also Jacob wanted to sneak his way into the blessing that was meant for Esau the eldest.

The only outcome I can draw from this is that we humans are broken, we can place ourselves in the shoes of both brothers. We are so greedy that we want to get anything we see or desire. We are also so negligent about our inheritance, we so easily sell our birthright as children of God for something very temporal and fleeting.

We are blinded like Esau and can only see the temporal benefits instead of the great blessings of being a child of God. We sell our inheritance for petty sins of greed, lust, pride‚Ä¶

Let us preserve our inheritance of being God‚Äôs children, never giving into the glitter of temporal pleasure. This world and all its pleasures are passing away.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 13 - Gabriella ###

Dear Lord, 
Teach us and inspire us to recognize our own brokenness and to avoid repeating what our ancestors have done over and over. Help us recognize our own wrongdoings and take the path you have planned for us. 

In your eyes Lord it must be a precious moment lost in eternity when we abuse your goodness and freewill.  

_Have mercy on us O Lord, have mercy on us!_

### Day 14: ‚ÄúWe are not perfect‚Äù - Michael Eltham ###

The Jews were God‚Äôs chosen people and we the Christians were grafted into God‚Äôs chosen people. In fact, Jesus come not only for the Jews but for everyone. Anyone who hears His voice and responds will be grafted in by Baptism, where we become Children of God.

Just as the blessing of Isaac is irreversible- even the sacraments are irreversible - once a Child of God - always a Child of God. Even if we become deceptive and steal like Jacob we are still God‚Äôs children. Though Jacob can justify himself because he actually bought the birthright of Esau for a lentil meal. But he deceived his father by wearing his brothers‚Äô clothes‚Äô and putting goat skin on his hands, he also lied to his father when he said he was Esau. His mother Rebekah was the one who helped him deceive his father.

The only conclusion we can come to is that we are all messed up. We are all in need of redemption.

The good news is that God loves us no matter what - we usually think that if we commit sin we lose our value and God does not love us anymore, in fact, it‚Äôs the opposite - the Good Shepherd leaves the 99 and goes in search of the lost. When the ‚Äúone lost‚Äù is found there is rejoicing in heaven. Let us not run away from His love, all we need to do is be found by him. He stands at the door and knocks - if anyone hears His voice - He will come in and dine with us. If you hear God‚Äôs voice do not harden your hearts today.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

#### Cathy Agarro ####

Yes, we are all in need of redemption. And we thank Jesus for providing a way for us to be restored to God‚Äôs love -the sacraments. May God bless us üôèto see Jesus in every one we encounter through the help of the Holy Spirit. üïäÔ∏è

[![Leah Feels Unloved](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day015.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NktvfJSKafo "Leah Feels Unloved")

### Day15: ‚ÄúWhat goes around comes around.‚Äù - Michael Eltham ###

We see how Jacob the younger brother tricked Esau to get the birthright and the blessing - a few chapters back. Now Jacob gets tricked by Laban his father-in-law, who promises Rachel the younger daughter if Jocob works for  7 years, he tricks him into marrying Leah. Jacob has to work another 7 years to marry the one he loves Rachel.

As we hear all that went down between the two wives Leah and Rachel trying to win the love of Jacob, we can draw a few conclusions - that 

1. it‚Äôs such a mess 

2. God is always on the side of those who are hated/deprived. 

Leah was tolerated/hated by her husband and the Lord blessed her by opening her womb and Rachel remained barren. However, the Lord did bless Rachel later on and opened her womb(probably after she turned to the Lord). 

Leah tried very hard to gain her husband's love - naming 3 children (in lines with my husband will Love Me) Many times spouses feel unloved, we need to pray and invite the Lord into the marriage and carry our cross until the Lord blesses our spouse. Let us rest assured that God will make something beautiful out of our mess, just as the twelve tribes of Israel were born amidst all the strife between Jacob and his two wives(the sisters).

We need to also invite the Lord in all our relationships, on our own we will make a mess of our marriage, as humans we are flawed. The Key is to invite the Lord into the relationships. 3 to a good marriage. The two spouses centered on the Lord. God will make something beautiful out of the mess we have created. 



May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Twelve Tribes of Israel ###

![Twelve Tribes of Israel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/TwelveTribesIsrael.jpg)

### Day 15 - Rosetta - ###

Today we see that God loves us no matter how broken and unloved we may feel with our own loved ones and those whom we keep close to our hearts. His love is omnipresent and is the only love that truly satisfies our soul. We also see that more than wealth and all materialistic things that we want and desire, ultimately as human beings at the core we long for love and acceptance. This is seen in the stories of both Leah & Job as they seek for love, approval and validation from their family (Leah - Jacob) and friends (Job).

### Day 15 By Simitra ###

It's Ok to know that right now there is some brokenness in our lives and that God can still use it.

We don't have to beat ourselves due to our brokenness but can instead grow in the awareness that we are already loved and are heirs to everything that belongs to the Father through Christ Jesus.

[![The Suffering of Job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day016.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3Ydar25mVnE "The Suffering of Job")

### Day16: "If God is for us who can be against us" Rom 8:31 -Michael Eltham ###

In today's reading Jacob hears God's voice calling him back to his Father's house - remember Jacob left in fear after stealing the blessing from his elder brother Esau. In a sense, Jacob had to deal with his deceptive and manipulative father-in-law Laban for many years. No matter how Laban tried to steal by changing what type of cattle belonged to him, God kept prospering Jacob's flock.

Finally, Jacob stirred by God's message decided to take all that he had and leave. Laban persuaded him "BUT" the Lord had put a hedge around Jacob. Laban could not lay a hand on Jacob(Because the Lord told Laban not to). "If the Lord is for us who can be against us". "No harm will come near our tent" "A thousand may fall on your right 10K on your left - but nothing can befall us" "No weapon formed against us shall prosper" and "He puts His angels in charge of us" "They patrol around us day and night" In the reading, we see Jacob meets the army of Angles. Let us not fear, but take refuge in the Lord. "He is our fortress and stronghold. In His arms we are safe."

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
