[![In the Beginning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day001.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BW0gXbEVYgA "In the Beginning")

### Day1 *We have God in our DNA* - Michael Eltham ###

The Bible opens with this great scene of creation, it reveals a bit of God‚Äôs nature ‚Äì God existed before all things and is the source of everything good, everything we know and understand. We see a glimpse of God‚Äôs nature, God is generous - keeps on creating and pouring life into this world. God creates an ordered and good world and puts everything in place and sets rules and boundaries. There is something to be learned from how God organized this world and set it in motion, we should also organize our lives, and set rules and boundaries based on the church's teachings and Sacred Scripture. When we live an organized, harmonious life we feel good, the reason being we were created by God in His own ‚Äúimage‚Äù and ‚Äúlikeness‚Äù ‚Äì we experience wholeness when we have things in order.

Man and woman were created as the "crown of creation" ‚Äì because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

26 Then God said, ‚ÄúLet us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; Gen 1:26

One important detail here is God said ‚ÄúLet us make humankind‚Äù, we have a Trinitarian God ‚Äì God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God is not alone, but a harmonious community of the three persons of the Holy Trinity, they are in such beautiful unity that there is no strife or disagreement ‚Äì but with one mind they all create this beautiful world.

We see a reference to the Holy Spirit, a wind from God, that is the breath of God ‚Äì the Holy Spirit.

The Hebrew word "Ruach" means ‚Äúwind,‚Äù ‚Äúbreath,‚Äù or ‚Äúspirit.‚Äù The corresponding Greek word is pneuma. Both words are commonly used in passages referring to the Holy Spirit.

We see the power of the Word of God, with just one Word ‚Äì things were created. The Word of God will have this effect on us as we study it every day in the Bible in a year program. It will create in us an orderly world, setting priorities right and we will end up living a harmonious life in union with the Holy Trinity.

God put his breath into us, and the Holy Spirit was put into our hearts.

then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. Gen 2:7

Since we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness, we receive our good attributes and dignity from God. We have God‚Äôs nature in our DNA, and we naturally have love in our hearts, for Example, a mother naturally loves her newborn and does not need to be taught how to love.

It is at "creation" that the ‚Äúdignity of life‚Äù is given to all human beings, that is why every human being has the dignity of life.

Every human being has the dignity of life because we are created in God‚Äôs image and likeness and God‚Äôs Spirit/breath was put into us. We should never discriminate based on skin color, race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation, every single one in created in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

The explanation of the word ‚Äúhelper‚Äù helps to put things in perspective. God is called helper several times in the Bible and hence helper is not meant to be second class or someone who did menial tasks. Women and Men are both created equal in the image and likeness of God. Let us respect all human beings as everyone has the dignity of life and both men and women are equal. 

God does not have Gender ‚Äì we cannot say that God is man or woman. We cannot even categorize God based on gender, God is our creator and He was even before Gender came into this world, God created gender when He made Adam ‚Äì man and Eve ‚Äì woman. When God was incarnate, He was born as a man for a reason. The reason is Jesus is the new Adam, and we the church is the new eve, created from Jesus‚Äô side when his side was pierced. Blood and water flowed out, life-giving blood and water that gave birth to the new Eve ‚Äì the Church.

Side Note: It will help us understand Genesis should if we did not read it chronologically or like a scientific book. Genesis does not aim to give a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe, it‚Äôs more like figurative language to describe real events.

That‚Äôs how the two events(Gen 1 and Gen 2) of the creation of man can be explained. Also things like ‚Äúhow God created light and darkness on day 1 and sun and moon on day 3‚Äù. It is best understood if we read it in figurative language.

Finally, we realize that God is the source of everything good, this should remind us to put him first in everything - He is the beginning. The Alpha and Omega.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 1 - creation - Irene ###

Something which struck me was 

1. God is our Creator. He made us we are his creation the work of his hands.

2. God is good.  Everything that He has created is good. 

3. He is our source and provider.  He has given us everything even before He made us.

4. God is our Helper our ever present help in every need.

5. He is a master planner putting every detail in place.

Our God is an awesome God 

Praise God the Father
Praise God the Son
Praise God the Holy Spirit the triune God.

### Day 1 - Gabriella ###

Praise God for Fr. Mike so beautifully explaining God's intention for us:
 
We are made in God's image and we were originally created for labour. 

As God freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. 

God is a creator so when he puts man and woman in the land he has them work. 

*The Lord God made us for labour and leisure. In  the creation story we see God working.*

He created the world in 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. God wants us to share in this, to labour,  till the land and keep it. 

And if God worked for 6 days and rested on the 7th we should follow suit.

Now I understand why my parents instilled in me: 
PRAY & WORK = ORA ET LABORA

God bless Fr. Mike for presenting the creation story so clearly. I didn't understand this in such detail before.

[![The Fall of Adam and Eve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day002.jpg)](https://youtu.be/WBg_xK44V0E "The Fall of Adam and Eve")

### Day2: *Distrust and Disobedience* - Michael Eltham ###

Man was made for communion with God, they spoke to God and heard God speak. It was a beautiful harmonious life, and everything was going great for Adam and Eve. As we read in the first chapter of the Catechism of the Catholic Church ‚Äì God created man to share in the blessed life of the Trinity. Adam and Eve were enjoying this beautiful life ‚Äì in direct communion with God.

1 God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life.CCC prologue 1

Now God has planted a garden in Eden and grew various plants with fruit that were pleasing to the eye and to eat. Adam was allowed to eat from any tree except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, ‚ÄúYou may freely eat of every tree of the garden; 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.‚Äù Gen 2:15-17

Satan is very crafty as we see in Genesis ‚Äì he sows seeds of doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. Satan tries to manipulate the truth and question it and eventually causes us to doubt the truth.

But the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not die; 5 for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

Satan is proposing that God is a liar and that God does not want our good. According to satan, God didn‚Äôt want them to eat the fruit lest they become like God. This would have caused doubt in Eve‚Äôs heart. The serpent described in Genesis is no rat snake, it's more like a Dragon like creature ‚Äì so there is also this element of fear that would have its role to play. Apart from doubt and fear satan eve was also fighting temptations.

So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise Gen 3:6

The fruit was also good to look at, good for the stomach and it made one like God.

She could not resist it anymore, the combined effect of doubt, fear, and temptation. She gave in and gave it to Adam as well, I would have expected Adam to at least resist ‚Äì but it‚Äôs described as though he just eats it. (Like a good husband ;) ‚Äì just joking ). Adam should have stood his ground and resisted the devil. 

The main thing that caused their fall was their distrust in God. God gave them everything ‚Äì every tree, every creature and even let them share in His divine life. But they just could not trust God enough. This distrust caused their disobedience. This caused sin to enter mankind. 

We can sit and marvel at how stupid our first parents were, but pointing one finger at someone points 4 fingers back at us. Genesis is not a storybook to read and fall asleep over, it‚Äôs the story of our lives. We are faced with the same temptations that Adam and Eve faced, we have doubts, fear, and temptation in our lives.

God has given us the truth in the Word of God and from Church tradition, we know what we ought to do. Yet we doubt it, we fear the consequences, we fear what the world will say, and we give into the temptations of the world. We look at what‚Äôs good for the eye, good for the flesh, and pride ourselves in our wisdom.

The devil does not have his own clay, he just takes what God created and twists the truth into a lie. Satan will take half-truths and add lies to it and put doubt in our hearts, he is the father of lies.

‚ÄúHe was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.‚Äù Jh 8:44

We sometimes give into the lies of the enemy and give into the temptations of the world. When we commit sin we tend to hide like Adam and Eve we try to cover our sin up.

7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves. Gen 3:7

I feel this is the first penance that Adam and Eve took on because as we all know fig leaves cause itch. This would have caused severe itch for Adam and Eve when they made loincloths with these leaves. I‚Äôm sure they were aware of this but they felt so upset with themselves and fearful.

Loved Fr Mike‚Äôs explanation of the tone of God for the verse ‚Äì ‚Äúwho told you you were naked?‚Äù The angry tone which most would assume compared to the sympathetic tone. God must have been really hurt - because we didn‚Äôt trust Him but believed the serpent instead.

Let us learn to trust God and his commandments. Man‚Äôs wisdom is foolishness to God, we should stop making up our own rules. If we decide that we can watch sports instead of worship on Sunday or that a fetus in the womb is just tissue ‚Äì we are listening to the lies of satan. We should listen to God‚Äôs voice and trust God fully.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 2 ‚Äì Alice To ###

Thoughts on action of Adam and the serpent:
1.	After creation, God has given Adam dominion over all animals (Gen 1:28). What Adam should have done when the serpent appeared before Eve was to rebuke it, protected Eve and cast the serpent out with his authority. Because of his inaction, Eve succumbed to temptation.
2.	The serpent is very clever. It did not do a direct onslaught. It just planted doubt in Eve‚Äôs mind by asking her a question. 
As a Christian, we should be aware of our God-given duty. We should always be aware of what our duty and mission is and adhere to it without fail or doubt because our God will not ask us to do things that we are not capable of and He will always be there to guide us along. We should also be aware that temptations, like the serpent will creep up on us without our being aware of it. We should always be vigilant. 
Pray each day for protection and guidance from the Holy Spirit and our Mama Mary.

### Day 2 By Cynthia D'Silva ###

Genesis 3:4-5 
*But the serpent said to the woman, ‚Äúyou will certainly not die.  God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, who knows good and evil.‚Äù* 
Satan did not change God‚Äôs word.  He cleverly twisted the Word and told Adam & Eve to look at God‚Äôs Word through his eyes.  
Instead of listening to the devil's interpretation of God‚Äôs Word, Eve should have consulted Adam, who knew better what commandment was given to him by God, and if Adam had any confusion he should have consulted his heavenly Father who gave him the commandment. 
We end up in the same situation when we try to interpret God‚Äôs Word on our own without guidance from those who have correct knowledge of the scriptures.

Genesis 3:15
*I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.*
By this promise, God gave the guarantee of His divine assistance in protecting Mary and the Church (the Eucharist / the mystical Body of Christ) from Satan.  
By this promise it is evident that Mary and Jesus were immaculately conceived, that is, without original sin.  Mary‚Äôs holiness was confirmed by Angel Gabriel when he addressed Mary with the words "hail, full of grace‚Äù (‚Äúkecharitomene‚Äù in Greek) (Luke 1:28), which means that Mary was full of grace, like the first Eve before the fall.

[Genesis 3:22-24](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/Genesis/3/22-24)

The Garden of Eden was a sanctuary / tabernacle where God dwelt with humans and Adam & Eve were told to leave the holy sanctuary because of the mortal sin which they both committed.
Mortal sin breaks our communion with God and results in ‚Äúspiritual death‚Äù which means ‚Äúeternal suffering (Hell) due to eternal separation from God.‚Äù
At any given time in our lives, we are always in a Covenant relation, either with God or with Satan.  Adam and Eve were created holy and full of grace, in a Covenant relation with God, and they were supposed to eat the fruits from the Tree of Life and live forever in that holy state.  But when they chose to obey Satan and ate the forbidden fruit, they automatically broke the Covenant with God and moved into a Covenant with Satan (mortal sin).  
By this they instantly destroyed the divine life within them and consequently lost all the sanctifying graces which were necessary to perfect the human nature.  Thus they spiritually damaged and weakened the human soul, putting the human race in the power of Satan.  Therefore God, in His divine wisdom, as a loving Father, expelled Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, so that humans would not eat from the Tree of Life in a state of mortal sin and live forever under the power of Satan.  
The Church follows the same principle.
If we receive the fruit (Communion) from the tree of Life (the Cross) when we are in a state of mortal sin we will be subject to eternal damnation (1 Corinthians 11:27-29).  When we receive Communion in a state of grace we receive divine life which will give us eternal life after we leave this world (John 6:54).

[1 Corinthians 11:27-29](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/1Corinthians/11/27-29)

[John 6:54](https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/John/6/54)

### Jenita Maria ###

1. *God the provider, the most loving Father*

We understand that.. Even though adam and Eve went Against God's word, and completely disobeyed him, God still loved them through his anger and wrath where he curses them, he still holds them. He takes care of them, and helps them get through their life on earth, to be back with him again for eternity in holiness. 

2. *The importance of giving the first fruits to God*

Giving the first hours of your day Or the first fruits of earnings to God shows how much he means to you in your life. We are ever ready to do everything for the person we love, giving the first in everything!! But why should the last few hours or whatever is remaining out of all the abundance God gave us, be given to him back as a sacrifice of love. Love of God is pure and we can only respect God by giving what we love to him.

### Day3: Walking with the Lord - Michael Eltham ###

It is so important for us to have a relationship with God. We are not saved just by being baptized or with church membership or by inheritance - it also depends on how we live our lives.

We all know what Cain did, and how he sinned. Now Adam and Even had another child Seth who is made in Adam‚Äôs image and likeness ‚Äì and Adam was made in God‚Äôs image and likeness.

When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth Gen 5:3

These are the two lines of Adam‚Äôs family Setithe line and Cainite line. The Cainite line seems to be doing evil and the Setithe line are doing good. Even though they are both from the same parent Adam and Eve and grew up in the same home - they turned out so differently. Just being part of a family will not make us good, we have to work hard to become good children as well. We need to teach our children to be good as well.

Now Enoch is a good example from the Setithe line who was good and walked with God. Enoch is the first human being who did not die because he walked so closely with God.

22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. 23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. 24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him. Gen 3:22-23

God must have been so close to Enoch that he let him live a long life of 365 years. Enoch apparently did the will of God and probably didn‚Äôt commit many sins. He was so close to God that God didn‚Äôt even let him die, he just took him up out of the earth. Well, how to we know that the verse didn‚Äôt just mean he died and God took him.

Some evidence can be found in Sirach and Hebrews.



ENOCH walked with the LORD and was taken, that succeeding generations might learn by his example. Sirach 44:16



Few on earth have been created like ENOCH; he also was taken up bodily. Sirach 49:14

By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: ‚ÄúHe could not be found, because God had taken him away.‚Äù Heb 11:5

We need to walk with the Lord and not be confirmed to the standards of the world, we should renew our minds with the Word of God.

In this corrupt and sinful world, we need to walk with the Lord as Enoch and Noah did.

Let us be the salt of the world and the light of the world.

May we not just do as the world does but live as God wants us to live, in the world but not of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè


### Day-3 Name: Anonymous ###

God is saying, Noah,  make this ark.  Because u clinged to  me, I will lift you up.

### Day 3 By Cynthia Dsilva ###

Genesis 5:24
*After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God for 300 years.  His whole lifetime was 365 years, then he was no more, because God took him.* 
Enoch had an encounter with God when he was 65 years old.  Thereafter, for the rest of his life he walked with God.  Enoch was not a monk.  He was an ordinary family man.  Enoch did not have any scriptures or Temple or Church to guide him and yet he was able to walk with God.  If Enoch could do it then it should not be difficult for us to walk with God when we have the scriptures and the Church to guide us.

Genesis 6:5-7
*The Lord saw that the people had become wicked and evil.   So the Lord said, ‚ÄúI will wipe out from the earth all the human beings I have created.‚Äù*
After God had already declared to Satan that He would put enmity between Satan and the woman (Genesis 3:15), Satan tried to destroy God's plan for redemption by tempting men and women to lead immoral & sinful lives and therefore God had to send the Great Flood and destroy all humanity except Noah and his family because Noah was found to be righteous.

[![The Flood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day004.jpg)](https://youtu.be/k4ksCrLNO2U "The Flood")

### Day 4 *Why does God allow evil in the world?* - Michael Eltham ###

We read how Noah - who walked with God, also listened and did what the Lord commanded him to do. Even though the people around him were doing evil things, Noah did what was right and listened to the instructions of the Lord. Noah built a huge ark according to the detailed instructions from the Lord. Then the Lord asked Noah to take in two of each species of animal.

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him. Gen 6:22

Noah did not care about what the people were talking about him, he did not bother about their opinion. He just did the will of God and listened to the instructions God gave him, even if it seemed foolish or made no sense. Why build a big ark when there was never a flood before or there was no heavy rain? Imagine storing food for a lot of animals and getting them to come into the ark.

People would have laughed at him, but Noah did everything the Lord told him.

We are called to be not only hearers of the word but doers as well (James 1:22~). Also from Mat 7: Everyone who hears the word and does it is a wise man who built his house upon the rock - the rain and the flood did not cause the house to fall.

Noah was a hearer and a doer of the word as well, which is why the water did not destroy him and his family.

Water is used to cleanse things and the great flood wiped out all the evil generation. Only Noah and his family were saved. Because Noah listened to God‚Äôs word and acted upon it, he became a blessing to his family.

We need to be hearers and doers of God's word like Noah. Even if it is at the cost of the whole city laughing at us.

We use water to clean regular things and also used for baptism. John the Baptist called people to be baptized by water in order to prepare for Jesus‚Äôs coming. When Jesus was baptized in the river of Jordan, he was not cleansed by the water but the water was cleansed by Jesus‚Äôs divine touch. The next time we dip our fingers in holy water let us remember that it cleanses us, it‚Äôs sacramental. Just as the flood waters cleansed the human race at a point like John the Baptist baptized in water to prepare us for Jesus, and just as blood and ‚Äúwater‚Äù poured out of the side of Jesus for the purification of the Church. We were baptized and made clean ‚Äì grafted into the body of Christ, the Church.

The image to remember is the Rainbow, it‚Äôs the promise that God made to Noah and to each one of us that He will never destroy us again.

‚ÄúI will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done. Gen 8:21

I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, 15 I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù 17 God said to Noah, ‚ÄúThis is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.‚Äù Gen 9: 3-17

The Rainbow is symbolic of God putting down his bow and deciding to never ever destroy us. This is an answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy does God allow evil in the world?‚Äù God is patient and will not act harshly to destroy all evil people. God is patient and hopes that even the evilest people will repent.

God re-established the covenant that he had with Adam, he makes a new covenant with Noah and blesses them ‚ÄúGod blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.‚Äù Gen 9:1

One would think that humans would learn from their mistakes, but no we keep on failing and breaking the covenant over and over again through generations. God did not just destroy all mankind but loved us even more, and sent Jesus ‚Äì His only begotten son.

God will not destroy us but love us more, love us until we repent and turn to Him. Let us not hurt God too much, return to His arms.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 4 Anonymous ###

1. The foundation between God and man is interwoven with reminder of God's gift of human life.  God forbids murder of man.

2. God says you can eat of the animals.  Animals are God 's creatures.  God entrusted animals to the stewardship of human beings.  And it is contrary to human dignity to be cruel to them.  This is an issue which troubled me a lot, when I saw humans attacking animals mercilessly.   

3. God loves His creation and creatures and we have to be obedient to His commandments. We should never question His ways because He created us and He knows  what is best for us.  I seek pardon for the times I have knowingly or unknowingly questioned.God, why He created animals to suffer at human hands?
All Glory  to The Most Holy Trinity!

### Day 4 Cynthia D'Silva ###

Genesis 7:1
Noah started building the ark 100 years before the flood started and not when it started to drizzle or rain.  When God said ‚Äúget in‚Äù Noah was so ready.
How ready are we if God says tomorrow ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to come home?‚Äù
Are we ready or would we start running around looking for a priest to make our last confession?
We must be ready for eternal lie every day of our earthly life, by being in a state of grace at all times with regular Confession and Communion.

[![Tower of Babel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/January/jpgs/Day005.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nBoRts9y6Ko "Tower of Babel")

### Day 5: *Let us make a name for ourselves* - Michael Eltham ###

Who does not want a good name for themselves, everyone wants the world to love them. We try to be first in sports, business, entertainment, or any field. Now there is no harm in excellence or making a name. But the problem comes when we say ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù or ‚Äúwe did it‚Äù and we take all the credit. We tend to forget that before we could do anything God had to create us and create the world so we have things to create with. Right from the start Adam and Eve wanted to become like God, at least that was the temptation the serpent threw at them.

‚ÄúFor God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5

Satan and the 1/3rd angels fell probably due to the same reason of wanting to be like God.

This tendency to become like God seems to lift its ugly head again in the tower of Babel.

Then they said, ‚ÄúCome, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.‚ÄùGen 11:4

God's grace and mercy are revealed when God came down to confuse their languages. God knew that even if they built a tower into the heavens and reached their highest levels of success they will still not be satisfied. Pride will never be satisfied, it will lead to greed. That is why we see the people who are trying to build a name for themselves will never be satisfied, they will go to any length to reach the top. Once they have reached a good level of success they will not feel satisfied and go into depression.

As St Augustine said - Our hearts will find rest only when we rest in the Lord. Even if we excel in our field of music, art, science, business or any field we will not be satisfied if we are trying to make a name for ourselves. But if lives are rooted in God and we are focused on lifting the name of the Lord higher, we will be blessed beyond our imagination.

We are all called to greatness. To be great saints, we ought to have that as our top priority as St Maximillian Kolbe did. However, it should be for the glory of the Lord and not for our self-interest or our glory.

Let John the Baptist's prayer be our prayer today "He must increase and I must decrease.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 5 - Gabriella ###

Make me a great saint O Lord
Make me a great saint!

Help me evangelize with the talents you had graced me with.

Help us to use our gifts for Your glory O Lord!
