### Abner Is Killed

[![Abner Is Killed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day122.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6PkwdySN5sg "Abner Is Killed")

### Day 122 Revenge should not be encouraged

A little back story will help us understand why Joab assistants Abner. Abner was Saul’s commander, after Saul died Abner took one of Saul’s sons - Ish-bosheth, and made him King of Israel. Fierce war breaks out between David’s men and Ish-bosheth’s army. Now Abner was one of the main commanders, David’s men were winning, and Abner and his men were running away. Now Asahel was a fast runner who ran like a wild gazelle. Abner warned Abner to not peruse him because he did not want to kill him. Asahel did not listen and Abner killed him in self-defense. This is fair play as far as war rules go.
Now Ish-bosheth accuses Abner, Abner was the one who originally installed Ish-bosheth, and decides to leave and join forces with David. David welcomes him and I’m sure they would eventually overturn Ish-bosheth.
However Joab has other plans, he calls Abner aside and kills him. Joab has revenge in his heart, he wanted to avenge his brother Asahel’s death. This is very sheepish of him to kill the great commander Abner without a proper fight.
King David does not accept this, being a just and truthful person, he calls a public fast. He even invites Joab to repent of his sin and mourn.
David’s lament song tells the whole story
Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze shackles. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. 2 Sam 24
We should take a public stand for everything that is unjust. For example: We need to take a stand as a Pro-Life supporter and do everything that we can to protect innocent unborn children from being murdered. Whenever there is evil done, we need to boldly reject it and take a stand against all violence, racism, hate crime, bullying, and injustice. Let us not be ashamed about our stance on sin or evil.
May The Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 122 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 4:9-10
*Jabez became the most distinguished of his brothers.*
*At birth his mother had named him Jabez, saying, “I bore him with pain.”*
*Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: “Oh, that you may truly bless me and extend my boundaries!  May your hand be with me and make me free of misfortune, without pain!” And God granted his prayer.*

The life and prayer of Jabez teaches us that our origins don't determine our destinies, and our requests should reflect the greatness of our God, not the smallness of our own expectations.

If you are labelled as a "*pain*" or by any other negative nickname, by people around you, simply cry out to the Lord, like Jabez, and ask Him to release you of this curse. The Lord of Jabez will surely hear you and answer you, even if there’s a delay, just as He did for Jabez.

*“Bless me and extend my boundaries.”*
Let us ask God to bless us and extend our spiritual boundaries.

*“May your hand be with me.”*
Let us pray to God for His guidance in everything we do.

*“Make me free of misfortune.”*
Let us pray to God to protect us from evil.

*“Make me free of pain.”*
Let us pray to God to help us to break the curse of sins in our lives by making true repentance.

### The Death of Ish-bosheth

[![The Death of Ish-bosheth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rC1H0abVdlM "The Death of Ish-bosheth")

### Day 123 Be a person of good character

While David’s public mourning of Abner(unjustly assassinated) is fresh in our minds, we see another incident that shows us more of David’s good character. When Ish-bosheth heard the news of Abner’s death, his courage failed. He was sleeping in his chamber and two of his own captains of raiding bands assassinated him(Ish-bosheth their own King) They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David hoping for a reward and possible position in David’s army. If David was any other king of those times, he would have welcomed them and thanked them for killing his enemy. However, the only reward David gave them is death.
David again is demonstrating great character, he is a just King(at least till now) – one who is pre-figuring Jesus the king of kings. David does not want injustice to happen even to his enemies.
Doesn’t this remind us of Jesus' teaching
43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. Mat 5:43-45
We are called to be people of good character, not just from an outward appearance but from the inside. All our actions flow from the heart, we need to have a clean heart. A heart that is just and fair, a heart that does not have partiality, a heart that genuinely wants the good of others.
Let us pray and ask for this new heart of flesh that is promised in Ezekiel.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. Ez 36:26
We see that David has this pure heart now, but later he commits sin and finds corruption in his heart that is why he prays.
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Ps 51:10
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### King David Rules

[![King David Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day124.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7EU6urkQGbI "King David Rules")

### Day 124 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 5:1-4
*Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh.”*
By recalling Adam's words (Genesis 2:23) Israel, the bride of God, chose David as their bridegroom King.  Saul was the first man chosen for this role but he failed.  David was the second one and the leaders accepted him.
But David was only a shadow of the real heavenly bridegroom King, Jesus.

*David was thirty years old when the leaders of the twelve tribes crowned him king.  Thereafter he made a Covenant with the leaders of the twelve tribes and started his office.*
Jesus was 30 years old when He started His ministry (Luke 3:23) and 33 years old when He was declared a king by the people (John 12:13). Thereafter He made a Covenant with His twelve Apostles in the Upper Room (Matthew 26:28).
Priests and kings had to be minimum thirty years of age to start their work because, according to the Jewish culture, thirty years was considered to be the age of maturity / wisdom.

The establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the old Covenant and God chose David to be the priest (2 Samuel 24:18 & 25), prophet (Acts 2:29-30) and king (2 Samuel 5:3), all three in one, the prototype of Jesus and the patriarch of the kingdom.  Thus, Jesus becomes the true “Son of David.”

Likewise, the establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the new Covenant and Jesus, the Son of David, was chosen by God to be the Priest (Hebrews 7:15-17; Revelation 1:13), Prophet (Matthew 13:57) and King (John 12:13-15) of the heavenly Kingdom.

2 Samuel 5:6-9
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/2Samuel/5/6-9>

After King David conquered the enemies (the Jebusites), took over the earthly Jerusalem and sat on the throne, he brought the Ark of the Covenant up to the earthly Jerusalem in a liturgical procession with the priests carrying the Ark (2 Samuel 6:2). Thereafter, David made Jerusalem, not just a political capital, but also a spiritual capital, the place where all pilgrims, Jews and gentiles, were invited to worship their one true heavenly Father.  This was a foreshadow of the new Covenant.

When Jesus conquered the enemy (Satan), and sat on the throne in Heaven, He opened the gates of the new Jerusalem (the Church) where all humanity, Jews and gentiles, are invited to worship their one true heavenly Father. Some decades later He took the Ark of the new Covenant (His Mother) up to the heavenly Jerusalem.

### Day #124 “One thing I ask of the Lord is to dwell in the house of the Lord forever”

Christianity is not a set of concepts or philosophy or principles or protocols it is a relationship, the ultimate relationship between God and man. The beauty of the Christian life is that God is with us always and forever. Jesus gave us this promise that “He will be with us forever till the end of days”. In the OT we have the promise that even if a mother forsakes a child, God will not leave us.
The key is for us to stay close to God. One definition of sin is
“God, I know what you want me to do, but I want to do what I want. “
Jesus thought us in the parable of the vine and the branches that we are branches and we need to abide in the Vine if not we will wither up.
David so far is being very obedient, constantly seeking God’s will in every battle he fights.
David knows the importance of God’s presence, that is why he prays the most important prayer “to dwell in the house of the Lord forever” being united with God was David’s strength. We also need to develop this attitude to be aware of God’s presence in our lives and cherish prayer time. We need to develop our relationship with the Lord, He is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. We need to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and follow him. We need to be united to the Vine and receive all the needed nutrients from the Lord.
Jesus is always standing at the door of our hearts and is willing to come in if we invite Him.
We have to be aware and cautious to not let sin creep into our lives.
We see that David is starting to lose his way as he decides to do his own things by taking on many wives and concubines which was forbidden for kings (forbidden for Israel’s Kings appointed by God) we will see that this will become David’s downfall soon.
May the Holy Spirit protect us from sin and lead us.🙏

### Covenant with David

[![Covenant with David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day125.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VVaAc2gyYgo "Covenant with David")

### Day #125 Mary the New Ark of the covenant

In today’s reading, the most important thing to call out is this parallel between the OT ark of the covenant and Mary the new ark of the covenant. The easiest way to call out the similarities is through a table, please read the similarities in the table comparison. After reading the similarities if we still have a doubt that Mary is the new ark of the covenant, we can fast forward to Revelations Chapters 11:19 and 12:1. As a first-century Jew you have been waiting for the ark of the covenant to show up for almost 6 centuries, since the time of Jeremiah. So when John has the vision of the Revelations the big deal is that the ark that was missing is finally found in heaven.
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1
Let us honor our lady the new ark of the covenant that carries the fulfillment of all the old testament prefiguration - she carries Jesus. For non-Catholics, this reflection may be hard to read, would suggest just asking God for revelation with an open mind.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
