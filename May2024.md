### Abner Is Killed

[![Abner Is Killed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day122.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6PkwdySN5sg "Abner Is Killed")

### Day 122 Revenge should not be encouraged

A little back story will help us understand why Joab assistants Abner. Abner was Saul’s commander, after Saul died Abner took one of Saul’s sons - Ish-bosheth, and made him King of Israel. Fierce war breaks out between David’s men and Ish-bosheth’s army. Now Abner was one of the main commanders, David’s men were winning, and Abner and his men were running away. Now Asahel was a fast runner who ran like a wild gazelle. Abner warned Abner to not peruse him because he did not want to kill him. Asahel did not listen and Abner killed him in self-defense. This is fair play as far as war rules go.
Now Ish-bosheth accuses Abner, Abner was the one who originally installed Ish-bosheth, and decides to leave and join forces with David. David welcomes him and I’m sure they would eventually overturn Ish-bosheth.
However Joab has other plans, he calls Abner aside and kills him. Joab has revenge in his heart, he wanted to avenge his brother Asahel’s death. This is very sheepish of him to kill the great commander Abner without a proper fight.
King David does not accept this, being a just and truthful person, he calls a public fast. He even invites Joab to repent of his sin and mourn.
David’s lament song tells the whole story
Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze shackles. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. 2 Sam 24
We should take a public stand for everything that is unjust. For example: We need to take a stand as a Pro-Life supporter and do everything that we can to protect innocent unborn children from being murdered. Whenever there is evil done, we need to boldly reject it and take a stand against all violence, racism, hate crime, bullying, and injustice. Let us not be ashamed about our stance on sin or evil.
May The Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 122 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 4:9-10
*Jabez became the most distinguished of his brothers.*
*At birth his mother had named him Jabez, saying, “I bore him with pain.”*
*Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: “Oh, that you may truly bless me and extend my boundaries!  May your hand be with me and make me free of misfortune, without pain!” And God granted his prayer.*

The life and prayer of Jabez teaches us that our origins don't determine our destinies, and our requests should reflect the greatness of our God, not the smallness of our own expectations.

If you are labelled as a "*pain*" or by any other negative nickname, by people around you, simply cry out to the Lord, like Jabez, and ask Him to release you of this curse. The Lord of Jabez will surely hear you and answer you, even if there’s a delay, just as He did for Jabez.

*“Bless me and extend my boundaries.”*
Let us ask God to bless us and extend our spiritual boundaries.

*“May your hand be with me.”*
Let us pray to God for His guidance in everything we do.

*“Make me free of misfortune.”*
Let us pray to God to protect us from evil.

*“Make me free of pain.”*
Let us pray to God to help us to break the curse of sins in our lives by making true repentance.

### The Death of Ish-bosheth

[![The Death of Ish-bosheth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rC1H0abVdlM "The Death of Ish-bosheth")

### Day 123 Be a person of good character

While David’s public mourning of Abner(unjustly assassinated) is fresh in our minds, we see another incident that shows us more of David’s good character. When Ish-bosheth heard the news of Abner’s death, his courage failed. He was sleeping in his chamber and two of his own captains of raiding bands assassinated him(Ish-bosheth their own King) They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David hoping for a reward and possible position in David’s army. If David was any other king of those times, he would have welcomed them and thanked them for killing his enemy. However, the only reward David gave them is death.
David again is demonstrating great character, he is a just King(at least till now) – one who is pre-figuring Jesus the king of kings. David does not want injustice to happen even to his enemies.
Doesn’t this remind us of Jesus' teaching
43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. Mat 5:43-45
We are called to be people of good character, not just from an outward appearance but from the inside. All our actions flow from the heart, we need to have a clean heart. A heart that is just and fair, a heart that does not have partiality, a heart that genuinely wants the good of others.
Let us pray and ask for this new heart of flesh that is promised in Ezekiel.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. Ez 36:26
We see that David has this pure heart now, but later he commits sin and finds corruption in his heart that is why he prays.
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Ps 51:10
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### King David Rules

[![King David Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day124.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7EU6urkQGbI "King David Rules")

### Day 124 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 5:1-4
*Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh.”*
By recalling Adam's words (Genesis 2:23) Israel, the bride of God, chose David as their bridegroom King.  Saul was the first man chosen for this role but he failed.  David was the second one and the leaders accepted him.
But David was only a shadow of the real heavenly bridegroom King, Jesus.

*David was thirty years old when the leaders of the twelve tribes crowned him king.  Thereafter he made a Covenant with the leaders of the twelve tribes and started his office.*
Jesus was 30 years old when He started His ministry (Luke 3:23) and 33 years old when He was declared a king by the people (John 12:13). Thereafter He made a Covenant with His twelve Apostles in the Upper Room (Matthew 26:28).
Priests and kings had to be minimum thirty years of age to start their work because, according to the Jewish culture, thirty years was considered to be the age of maturity / wisdom.

The establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the old Covenant and God chose David to be the priest (2 Samuel 24:18 & 25), prophet (Acts 2:29-30) and king (2 Samuel 5:3), all three in one, the prototype of Jesus and the patriarch of the kingdom.  Thus, Jesus becomes the true “Son of David.”

Likewise, the establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the new Covenant and Jesus, the Son of David, was chosen by God to be the Priest (Hebrews 7:15-17; Revelation 1:13), Prophet (Matthew 13:57) and King (John 12:13-15) of the heavenly Kingdom.

2 Samuel 5:6-9
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/2Samuel/5/6-9>

After King David conquered the enemies (the Jebusites), took over the earthly Jerusalem and sat on the throne, he brought the Ark of the Covenant up to the earthly Jerusalem in a liturgical procession with the priests carrying the Ark (2 Samuel 6:2). Thereafter, David made Jerusalem, not just a political capital, but also a spiritual capital, the place where all pilgrims, Jews and gentiles, were invited to worship their one true heavenly Father.  This was a foreshadow of the new Covenant.

When Jesus conquered the enemy (Satan), and sat on the throne in Heaven, He opened the gates of the new Jerusalem (the Church) where all humanity, Jews and gentiles, are invited to worship their one true heavenly Father. Some decades later He took the Ark of the new Covenant (His Mother) up to the heavenly Jerusalem.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day #124 “One thing I ask of the Lord is to dwell in the house of the Lord forever”

Christianity is not a set of concepts or philosophy or principles or protocols it is a relationship, the ultimate relationship between God and man. The beauty of the Christian life is that God is with us always and forever. Jesus gave us this promise that “He will be with us forever till the end of days”. In the OT we have the promise that even if a mother forsakes a child, God will not leave us.
The key is for us to stay close to God. One definition of sin is
“God, I know what you want me to do, but I want to do what I want. “
Jesus thought us in the parable of the vine and the branches that we are branches and we need to abide in the Vine if not we will wither up.
David so far is being very obedient, constantly seeking God’s will in every battle he fights.
David knows the importance of God’s presence, that is why he prays the most important prayer “to dwell in the house of the Lord forever” being united with God was David’s strength. We also need to develop this attitude to be aware of God’s presence in our lives and cherish prayer time. We need to develop our relationship with the Lord, He is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. We need to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and follow him. We need to be united to the Vine and receive all the needed nutrients from the Lord.
Jesus is always standing at the door of our hearts and is willing to come in if we invite Him.
We have to be aware and cautious to not let sin creep into our lives.
We see that David is starting to lose his way as he decides to do his own things by taking on many wives and concubines which was forbidden for kings (forbidden for Israel’s Kings appointed by God) we will see that this will become David’s downfall soon.
May the Holy Spirit protect us from sin and lead us.🙏

### Covenant with David

[![Covenant with David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day125.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VVaAc2gyYgo "Covenant with David")

### Day #125 Mary the New Ark of the covenant

In today’s reading, the most important thing to call out is this parallel between the OT ark of the covenant and Mary the new ark of the covenant. The easiest way to call out the similarities is through a table, please read the similarities in the table comparison. After reading the similarities if we still have a doubt that Mary is the new ark of the covenant, we can fast forward to Revelations Chapters 11:19 and 12:1. As a first-century Jew you have been waiting for the ark of the covenant to show up for almost 6 centuries, since the time of Jeremiah. So when John has the vision of the Revelations the big deal is that the ark that was missing is finally found in heaven.
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1
Let us honor our lady the new ark of the covenant that carries the fulfillment of all the old testament prefiguration - she carries Jesus. For non-Catholics, this reflection may be hard to read, would suggest just asking God for revelation with an open mind.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Old and New Covenants

![God's covenants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/oldandnewcovenants.jpg)

### Day 125 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 6:6-7
Uzzah died because the Ark of the Covenant was not given its due respect.
According to the Law, the Ark of the Covenant was to be touched and carried only by the ordained Levites, and Uzzah was not a Levite.  Also, David was transporting the Ark in a cart.
God may have given the Law to Moses centuries ago, but the Law was still the same.
God’s Law never changes from the time it is given until the end of time.

2 Samuel 6:14-15
David (the royal priest) represents Jesus, the Ark represents Mary, and Jerusalem represents God’s heavenly city.
David’s joy in bringing the Ark of the Covenant into the earthly Jerusalem prefigures the joy of Jesus in bringing Mary’s body into the heavenly Jerusalem.
Let us make sure that we don't receive a curse, like Michal did (2 Samuel 6:16 & 23), by failing to rejoice with Christ that His blessed mother is in the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 7:14
*“I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.”*
By these words God adopted David’s son Solomon long before Solomon was born (2 Samuel 12:24).

God first started the monarchy of His holy kingdom when He created Adam and gave him the authority to rule over the whole earth.  Thus, by default, his wife Eve would be the queen.  But when they brought sin into the world they lost their titles.

God later picked another couple, Abraham and Sarah, who would bring forth Isaac, the earthly son of the promise, and through Isaac would come the new Adam and the new Eve (Jesus and Mary), the king and queen mother of God’s holy Kingdom.

Many centuries later, Solomon, the son of the earthly King David and a descendant of Abraham’s son Isaac, became the son of God through the grace of adoption.  Some years later, when Solomon was crowned king, at his right hand was enthroned his mother, the queen.
This was a prototype of the Heavenly Davidic Kingdom of God.

In the new Covenant, Jesus, the son of God, would become the son of David, through the grace of adoption by Joseph, and at the right hand of Jesus, in Heaven, would be enthroned His mother, the queen and a descendant of David, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom.

What David established, Solomon continued and Jesus fulfilled.
Thus we recognize that establishing a king and a queen to start the monarchy of the new Covenant, was an essential part in God’s Covenant plan for His holy Heavenly Kingdom.

### David's Victories

[![David's Victories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day126.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JZa4niEoN00 "David's Victories")

### Day #126 The Lord gave David victory wherever he went

In the last chapter, we see King David was gifted a Palace by the neighboring King – who sent wood, carpenters, and workers to build a palace. Now David is concerned for the Lord and feels unworthy to live in the Palace while God rests in a tent. This seems like a very just and genuine concern for the Lord, so much so that Nathan the prophet says yes immediately. However, at night the Lord says no, but the Lord rewards David’s concern, the word of the Lord said
“I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth” 2 Sam 7:9
We see that David starts his wars against the neighboring kingdoms and places, the bible records the thousands of men who were conquered and those who were slain. King David’s army was winning every battle – because of the promise of the Lord to make his name great.
“The Lord gave victory to David wherever he went” 2 Sam 8:14
The promises of the Lord are true and genuine.
The promises of the Lord are sure, silver refined in a crucible, silver purified seven times. Ps 12:7
Let us remember that the word of the Lord will never return empty, it will always accomplish its purpose
so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Is 55:11
So my friends let us not be discouraged but trust in the promise of the Lord for His word will never return empty but will accomplish all that God has in store for us.
David’s kingdom will enhance even more than he can imagine through his children and eventually by God himself – in Jesus Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 126 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 10:13-14
*So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.*

King Saul lost the throne and his life because of the 4 sins which he had committed against the Lord:

1. For the massacre of priests in the city of Nob because they were protecting David;

A priest is God's anointed man who represents God on earth.  When we harm a priest, physically or verbally or in any other way, we offend God directly.

2. For sparing the Amalekite King Agag out of pity, instead of destroying him in obedience to God’s command (1 Samuel 15:17-21);

The Amalekite King Agag was a symbol of sin.  When we allow ourselves to live comfortably in sin, instead of destroying it completely, the sin will eventually be the cause of the destruction of our soul (Hell).

3. For not heeding Samuel’s request to wait for him for seven days to offer the sacrifice;

Offering to God the sacrifice prescribed by God, can be done only by God's anointed priests.  Anyone else trying to offer the prescribed sacrifice, even if they know the procedure, is trying to be like God without God, and that is an act of the devil.

4. For consulting a necromancer, instead of consulting the Lord.

According to the Mosaic Law, consulting people who were involved with occult practices, was forbidden (Deut. 18:10).
In the new Covenant, the Church still follows the same Law to this day.  Practicing divination, or using the services of people who are involved with occult practices, is a mortal sin.

In the old Covenant, Saul lost his physical life for committing these sins, but in the New Covenant, we will lose our spiritual/eternal life.

We know that David and Jonathan – Saul’s son were Best Friends Forever(BFF) – in fact, they would give their lives for each other. Now that David is in a position to pay back to Jonathan – he decides to find Jonathan's kin of Jonathan and ensure they are taken care of.
David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 2 Sam 9:1
When they found Mephibosheth, Saul’s son who was lame in both feet. David summoned him and vowed to take good care of him.
“Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.” 2 Sam 7
We should be inspired to remember our friends of old, to not forget them when fortune favors us.
We should remember all our vows, our marriage vows, the promises we make at baptism to raise good children, the promises we make at confession, to avoid the near occasion of sin, and the promise we make to take care of our parents and families.
It is one thing to read the good dead’s that David did or to make promises, it’s another thing to actually keep them. That is why Jesus said the below.
“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Mat 5:33-37
Jesus wants us to be people of action and not just words. It’s one thing to say “I love you” and another thing to be “Patient, kind, not envious, not proud, not self-seeking, not holding a record of wrongs.”
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Cor 13
Let our "Yes be Yes" and our "No be No". Let us people who keep our word, we should not be all words and no action.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 127 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 12:32
*A group of men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, joined David in Hebron to make him king.*

“Time” (in English) is either Kairos or Chronos (in Greek).
*Chronos time* refers to clock time or calendar time which humans follow, and which is mostly based on the movement of the sun or moon.
*Kairos time* is the right or perfect time when God chooses to intervene to accomplish His divine plan, and there is no fixed earthly date or time for God to intervene.
"Kairos" time can, however, become "Chronos" time after the event takes place and we either mark it on the calendar or remember it by the clock.

The group of men of Issachar understood “kairos” time because they had a close relationship with God (Galatians 5:25).  They were therefore given the knowledge and understanding that according to God’s plan David would rule Israel after Saul since David was already anointed for the same purpose.  Therefore, after the death of Saul, the group of men knew that it was the right time for them to leave the house of Saul and join the house of David.

There may have been “kairos” times in our lives too when God blessed us with miracles.
Our prayers are always heard by God on day 1 but His answers, whether positive or negative, will always come in His “kairos” time.  In the meanwhile, we must continue in our relationship with the Lord with patience.

### Day #128 How to handle "humiliation"

We read that King David wanted to be kind and loyal to the Ammonites because Nahash the ammonite king(dead now) was good to him.
David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.2 Sam 10:2
However, Nahash’s son Hanun was influenced by his commanders and humiliates David’s men.
So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away. 2 Sam 10: 4
Now David’s men were greatly humiliated, but David handled the situation very well he went out to meet the men and asked them to stay at Jericho until their bead grew back.
David then send his Valant men who defeated the Ammoniates.
Now how do we handle humiliations? Let’s think of the last time we felt humiliated. We will mostly resort to one of two responses – fight or flight. If we chose to fight - we will try to humiliate the other person even worse or get angry and curse them. If we resort to flight - we will try to pass it off as though nothing happened or leave the place.
The best way to handle humiliation is to pray first, and try not to get humiliated because that is what they want.
Then warn the person sternly that their word or action is not acceptable, most people would back off at this point.
If they still persist then action is needed, everyone is under some authority. And the Lord is watching over you, He will fight for you, fight for the people who do the right thing.
A true event in St Mother Theresa’s life
One day Mother Teresa went to a local bakery to ask for bread for the starving children in the orphanage. The baker, outraged at people begging for bread from him, spat in her face and refused. Mother Teresa calmly took out her handkerchief, wiped the spit from her face and said to the baker, “Okay, that was for me. Now what about the bread for the orphans?” The baker, shamed by her response, gave her the bread she wanted.
Like St Mother Theresa let us turn to Jesus who was humiliated, spat upon, mocked and insulted, beaten and stripped naked. He was able to pray
“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
It is not easy to stay calm and respond in a proper way, we are not Jesus or Mother Theresa. But we can be and God will help us in our weakness, that someday we will be able to respond in love. When people hurt us, or insult us those are all actual prayer requests, they are indirectly asking us “Can you pray for me?”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### David Commits Adultery

[![David Commits Adultery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day129.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jQHbBVAaLXo "David Commits Adultery")

### Day 129 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 11:1-27
During the spring of the year, when Kings fought at the battlefields, David sent his officers to fight the Ammonites. Against his call of duty, David chose to stay back and while away his time at the palace.  David committed one grave mistake.  He sent the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield. The Ark of the Covenant symbolized the presence of God.  David ended up committing adultery with Bathsheba because he then rested in the palace without the presence of God.

While idling away his time, David happened to see what he was not supposed to see. He could have looked the other way and moved on with his royal duties but he chose to continue looking.

If we happen to see something that we are not supposed to see, it is definitely not our mistake. However, if we decide to continue looking on with interest, and think with passion, we are surely putting ourselves on risky grounds.

David looked on and entered the dark and dubious world of sin. He entertained the evil spirit and allowed the spirit to control his mind.

When God is not with us it is very easy for the evil spirit to control our minds to do ungodly acts.

Later, to hide one sin David ended up committing another sin by killing Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba.

The closer we get to the object of our temptation, the more destructive it gets. We must flee from sin as from a snake.  Sin traps us into a vicious cycle.

When we allow ourselves to be influenced by one evil spirit, it will invite more evil spirits into our lives and thus we end up committing one sin after another to cover up the first sin if we don’t repent and try to get rid of the first one.

Failure of our spiritual lives begins with the absence of God in our lives and gradually affects our physical lives.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day #129 David’s Sloth leads to Adultery and Murder

We have been reading David’s life story, he was such a lovely person – a man after God’s heart, a just, kind, and wise King, he was a worshiper of God – a musician and one who loved the presence of the Lord. However, he has his weaknesses– we know that he was accumulating wives and concubines which the Lord forbid for the Kings of Israel.
In this sequence of events, the first sin David committed was the sin of sloth.
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Sam 11:1
The kings in those days would go out to fight battles, however, David did not go – he sent his commanders instead. David should have been out there fighting battles for the Lord, however, the scripture says that he was sleeping on the couch in the afternoon and walking on the roof instead.
Laziness is creeping into him, with comfort and luxury, his will and spirit are weakened. He looks at a woman bathing and should have just looked away.
From the sin of lust of the eyes, it went to lust of the thoughts. He is thinking of her and eventually makes inquiries about her. He comes to know that it’s Uriah’s wife one of his trusted men. He should have backed off at least now, but his lust overtook him. He mis-uses his power as King and gets what he wants. Bathsheba becomes pregnant and now David is desperate. He tries to fix it by bringing Uriah back to his house to sleep with his wife, just doesn’t work for Uriah was a just man.
Eventually, He plots the death of Uriah and commits murder. David was a person to consult the Lord for everything, here he is falling head over heels into different sins.
What can we learn from this? We can learn that we are all broken earthen vessels, no one is perfect not even the great people of the Bible. But God makes us all whole again.
The other thing that we can learn is that we should stop sin when it's small and easy to overcome. If David has to resist the sin of sloth, he would have gone to battle and won victories, he would have prevented the other grave sins.
We should also try to avoid the near occasion of sins, we all know our weaknesses – we should avoid falling into bigger traps. For example: If you struggle with the sin of alcoholism – avoid going to a bar or going out with friends who love to drink,
if you are addicted to shopping – do not carry your credit card – use cash when you go shopping,
if you are addicted to pornography – use your devices only in public places/family rooms.
It is easy to say no to sin at the beginning – once you cross the hedge – you cannot stop yourself.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Nathan Condemns David

[![Nathan Condemns David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day130.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OqvYL60-Zio "Nathan Condemns David")

### Day 130 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 12:1-15
David committed a sin by killing an innocent man (Uriah) to cover up his first sin of adultery (2 Samuel 11:1-25).

When prophet Nathan asked David to judge a case of a poor man being robbed by a rich man, David was quick to condemn the rich man for the injustice, while he kept his own sin covered.

We all commit sins due to the weakness of our damaged souls. Some of us are aware of our own weaknesses and we try to correct and improve ourselves, which is good. But some of us are blind to our own weaknesses while the weaknesses in others are so obvious to us that we condemn them.

Jesus said, “Let the one among you who is without sin, be the first one to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7).

God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17).

I came not to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12:47).

When Jesus does not condemn us, then who are we to condemn others?
When we see weaknesses or sins in others, let us be slow to condemn them.  Let it be an occasion for us to do a soul-searching, make a list of our own weaknesses and ask the Lord for pardon.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day #130 “3 C’s to Repentance – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart”

As we study Bible Characters we should always place ourselves in their shoes or identify with them, as we are all weak human beings. Apart from reading about their horrendous sins, we should also learn how they dealt with them. King David can teach us a great lesson on repentance, in fact, his Psalm, Psalm 51 has been the one most people use when they have committed a sin and are repenting. There is a big misconception about Christian repentance, because of the word used. The word repentance is defined as - sincere regret or remorse. However, repentance is not merely feeling sorry about what you did, it is being contrite and deciding to change your ways. The Greek word used in the gospels is
Metanoia– which means “a transformative change of heart”.
There are three steps to repentance.
CONVICTION
We see that King David commits major sins of Sloth, Adultery, and Murder and now breaks another one of the 10 commandments by bringing Bathsheba into his home, thinking that all is well. But the Lord was not happy about His servant David. He sends the prophet Nathan to tell David the story about the unjust owner of many sheep. David is cut to his heart, and he is convicted of his sin.
We need people in our lives to tell us when we are going off track, our spouse, parents, children, friends, society, priest, confessors, spiritual directors, events, retreats, sermons, word of God, talks, BIAY whatever it takes to convict us. We need the Holy Spirit who will lead us to all truth about ourselves, the Holy Spirit will convict us of our mistakes.
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Ps 51:3
CONTRITION
a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. Ps 51:17
This is the golden verse for repentance, when we are convicted of sin we should be cut to the heart. Feeling sorry for having offended our ever-loving God. We should not just focus on the wrong thing we did, but on the relationship that is broken due to sin. We are hurting our God and our neighbor when we sin, we are actually hurting the church as we are the body of the church. We cannot come to the Lord with pride or excuses for committing sin. just with a contrite and broken heart
Change of Heart
It just does not stop at sorrow for sin, it starts with a Change of heart. We have a God of second chances, He wants us to overcome sin and death. God will take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh; He will put a new and willing spirit in us. Change is the most important part of repentance. Whenever Jesus healed or forgave sin in His earthly ministry he always said – “Sin no more”
So what happens if we fall into sin again, don’t be discouraged just follow the process again CCC – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart. If you keep falling into sin, just keep getting up.
Saint Faustina reminds us to never give up.
I perform works of mercy in every soul. The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. My mercy is confirmed in every work of My hands. He who trusts in My mercy will not perish, for all his affairs are Mine, and his enemies will be shattered at the base of My footstool (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 723).
Just keep going to the font of mercy whenever you need to be washed of your sin. Eventually, the Lord will break you out of the sins you are unable to shake off. All the three C’s are present in the sacrament of confession, so frequent it as much as possible to rid yourself of sin.
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:15-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Hope for the Future

### Day #131 Lust does not satisfy

We read this horrendous event of a brother raping his stepsister, it’s truly very hard to read. Amnon is David’s son who has a very beautiful stepsister Tamar. Amnon was so obsessed with her that he made himself ill because of the sister. Amnon had a crafty friend who gave him this nasty idea to pretend to be sick just to be with her alone. Amnon forced himself on Tamar because she declined his advances and raped her as he was stronger than her. Something surprising happens after he rapes her, he hates her. He loved her earlier or though he did - he only stiring up lust in his own being.
Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”2 Sam 13:15
One would assume that he would be happy and satisfied for he got what he wanted. But he only hated her after it, because she reminded him of his brokenness. This is the result when people lust over things and people, it never ends in fulfillment.
When people are looking to gratify their own desires, they are mistaken, they will never be satisfied. It’s like picking at a healing scab, it gets hurt again and bleeds causing another scab. This continues and the person never heals but the wound gets bigger and bigger. People who are in a relationship just for the pleasure will never be satisfied and we look for other options.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:18
Lust and sexual immorality is a sin that hurts the sinner as he/she is sinner against his/her own body. The Bible asks us to flee from this sin as we are hurting ourselves.
One tires to blame the media, society and the devil for the sins of lust, however it's mostly the desires within that person that is to be blamed.
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death. James 1:14-15
If we let the sin of lust rein in us, we will eventually become spiritually blind and find it hard to come out of the trap, which leads to spiritual death.
Let us love instead of lust. Look for the benefit of the other person and their well-being. The sacrament of marriage celebrates the union of the husband and wife, who are open to life and open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### David And Absalom

[![David And Absalom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day132.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZFb0B0AZ_Js "David And Absalom")

### Day #132 Holding a grudge - Michael Eltham

We are still getting over the misery that Tamar went through, her stepbrother Amnon raped her and threw her away. Her whole life was ruined she could not get married after that as in the Jewish custom then, only virgins get married. Her brother Absalom takes her into his house and she lives her life as a desolate woman. What a tragedy, a life wasted due to Amnon’s lust. If it wasn't for Amnon, Tamar would have gotten married and had children and raised them, she is deprived of the family life. This caused a lot of hate in Absalom’s heart, and he worked up a plan to avenge His sister’s rape. He invites the sons of David for an event at his house and had Amnon killed.
Absalom flees and is in hiding. Now Joab tries to patch things up by tricking David to listen to a wise woman’s fake story(Joab tried to use the format Nathan used to convict David of his sin – by telling a similar story) we can read the story, and eventually, David asks Absalom to come back to the city. However, David does not let him come into his presence for two full years. Absalom is getting frustrated as the king asked him to come back but does not let him come into his presence. The Kind does not talk to Absalom directly, he is letting him stay in the city but does not accept him back as a son. David and Absalom are just tolerating each other here, there is no repentance or forgiveness, and the love is not restored.
This is the state of many families today, there is a lot of hate, misunderstanding, and grudges between family members – between parents and children, between siblings, between cousins, between in-laws. Most people are taking the positions that David and Absalom took – no repentance or forgiveness – we are just tolerating each other without actually sorting out the problem, without genuine repentance or forgiveness. There is bitterness in the air, one person not talking to the other, not seeing eye to eye, hurtful words and gestures.
The model we have in David and Absalom is not the one we should be following. We should follow the model of the prodigal son and the Father. The Father in the parable was looking out for his son every day, waiting for him to come back, David was just grieving his other son's death and not even concerned about Absalom. Absalom was acting like the prodigal son, the prodigal son had an attitude of “At least I will be a servant at my father's house” - Absalom was burning down fields in frustration.
Let us model our repentance and forgiveness on the parable of the prodigal son. Let us pray for our families and especially for the strained relationships. It is easier said than done, but let us not feel discouraged for “when we are weak He is strong.”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day #133 Falling to correct our kids can make them rebellious

As we try to wrap our heads around the mess in David’s family, Amnon rapes his stepsister Tamar and her brother Absalom avenging it by killing Amnon (his stepbrother). One can’t help but call out the lack of action on David’s part. David being their father should have stepped in and handled the situation better, he should have asked the Lord for direction on what needed to be done. David was great when it came to his ruling as King but he let his personal life slip, he failed to be a good father.
The first mistake he made was to have so many wives and children even though God forbid it for the Kings of Israel. The second mistake was his lack of prudent about sending Tamar to Amnon’s house. The third mistake was In-action toward Amnon’s sin – he failed to protect his daughter and failed to take her in to his house after Amnon sent her off. Fourth he failed to make peace with Absalom and failed to give him back his position as son and did not assign him any duty in the kingdom.
This caused Absalom, who was very good-looking and smart, clever, and a man with an initiative to gain popularity. Eventually, due to King David’s inaction – he now must flee from his own son Absalom. David has let down his people and let down the Lord in failing to be a good father.
Let us learn from this and be good parents to our children, parents who love, forgive, and discipline them when they go off track. If we fail to act, we are supporting their sin. They will grow in their sin and bad habits and eventually become a beast someday. They will be a force that neighed we or society cannot content with, we will have to flee as well.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Devastating Effects of Sin

[![Devastating Effects of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day134.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SWpv2XiqxR4 "Devastating Effects of Sin")

### Day #134 We humans are prone to sin - concupiscence

Earlier Absalom was so zealous to avenge his sister’s rape, now commits rape. He gets advice from Ahithophel (David’s previous adviser and friend) who suggests a shameful act to show dominance over David. Absalom sleeps with David’s concubines in the sight of all of Israel. The one who avenged rape earlier now commits the same sin, shamelessly in public.
David earlier was just and did not lay hands on King Saul even though Saul was envious of him and tried to kill him. This same David is envious of Uriah’s wife Bathsheba and causes the murder of Uriah.
What becomes clear is that we humans can be good one day and terribly bad another day. We are prone to sin and are not strong, the flesh is weak.
We have to be careful with ourselves, given the opportunity or on a bad day, each of us can be terrible. According to the below excerpt from the CCC we all have an inclination to sin, even though the original sin is washed away in Baptism we are very capable and inclined to sin. The term is “concupiscence” - an inclination to evil.

CCC 405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called "concupiscence". Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.
Our enemy the devil is always on the prowl, trying to devour us. Let us never leave the side of Jesus, lest we fall into the trap that is set for us.
Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 1 Pet 5:8
May the Angels of the Lord protect and guard our hearts against every evil, harm, and danger.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Counsel of Hushai

[![The Counsel of Hushai](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day135.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lE1T8uUTDDs "The Counsel of Hushai")

### Day #135 “Bad counsel can lead to destruction”

Absalom is now looking for counsel to become King of Israel. Ahithophel suggests that he will choose 12K men to pursue King David and strike him down. Once the King is dead everyone will naturally follow Absalom, now everyone likes this suggestion.
Absalom wants a second opinion and asks Hushai. Hushai is loyal to David and is just pretending to be on Absalom’s side. Hushai is very crafty with his words and makes a suggestion, one that will favor King David. Before he suggests he rejects Ahithophel’s suggestion and says that 12K men will not be enough to kill King David as he is a warrior King and has Valant men who will defeat the 12K men.
Hushai suggests that Absalom take the whole of Israel and pursue David, just to ensure he does not get away. He also suggests that Absalom should personally go to battle, which appealed to him so he could get the credit for killing David. Everyone liked this suggestion better and they wanted to implement it. Hushai sends messengers ahead to David so that David can escape and be prepared to take out Absalom instead.
As we will see in future episodes Hushai’s counsel was what brought the downfall of Absalom.
We need to learn from this to be very careful about the advice we get from people. This world is filled with shrewd and cunning people who don’t really care about us. They just want their own motives met when they suggest something to us.
See, I am sending you out like sheep into the midst of wolves; so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Mat 10:16
Jesus knows that this world is full of cunning people and that’s why he tells us to be wise as serpents. We cannot trust the advice of anyone, we need to test everyone to see if they come from the Lord or from the world.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 1 John 4:1
May we find friends of good counsel and spiritual directors who can guide us on the right path.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Absalom is Defeated

[![Absalom is Defeated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day136.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Sx8TF_EK5zI "Absalom is Defeated")

### Day 136 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 18:9-33
Although David was a good man, with a forgiving heart like God's, he still had his own flaws. Because of his one sin (adultery), his sons also ended up committing sins, up to the extent that his son wanted to usurp the throne from him.  So David had to run away from home and hide from his own son, until his son was killed in battle.

Like David, sometimes we too may be surrounded by people who we think are our own but they connect with us only for what we have, and not because they love us or for who we are and how much we care about them.  At such times we may feel alone and abandoned, but just as God rescued David from the hands of his enemies who were his own, so also God will come to our aid if we are obedient to all His Commandments.

God does not punish children for their parents’ sins (Ezekiel 18:4 & 20) but when we are comfortable living with unforgiven mortal sins then we give the devil a foothold in our homes and the devil’s aim is to destroy families, beginning with our children.  Therefore, if we have committed mortal sins then we must repent, correct our errors, and confess our sins without much delay so that we can keep our souls purified at all times and be a blessing to our children.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### DAY 136 - Shiela

Today's study David spoke as a father, not as a King, ready to forgive, Absalom his son, though it was more than a domestic quarrel. There was pride at the victory over rebellious forces but Absalom's death was a tragic to David. Absalom had three sons.
In Chronicles duties were assigned by David for the construction of the Temple, conducting regular services of morning and evening worship and burnt offerings unto the Lord.
The Psalm is a collection of Wisdom Teachings. HUMBLY submit before the Lord who never abandons His Children. God's children are never completely forsaken, infact, HIS Blessings will extend to the next generation.

### When David Heard

[![When David Heard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/whendavidheard.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8_QTy9Jhj5k "When David Heard")

### Day #136 The Regret of David is a warning for us to reconcile.

Note: Hit play on the song as you read this reflection.
We have been following the long saga of David’s poor role as a father. David did not act when Amnon raped his step-sister Tamar, David did not act when Tamar was sent away humiliated – he did not help her. Because of David’s inaction - Absalom had to take matters into his own hands and punish Amnon. Indirectly David made Absalom into the beast that he became. David did not make peace with Absalom when he was in hiding. David did not accept him back as a son when he was in the city. Now Absalom is forcefully taking the kingdom from David. David whose praises were sung “Saul slain thousands and David ten thousand ” is now being cursed, stones and dirt is thrown on him.
David is humbled and his heart is starting to repent for his inaction as a father.
“My son, my own flesh and blood, is trying to kill me. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the Lord has told him to. “ 2 Sam 16:11
Today we read David’s instructions to deal gently with Absalom. David has not yet fully accepted him as his son as he calls him, young man.
Later when David hears that Absalom was slain, he breaks down and accepts the fact that he lost a son. He is weeping and repenting probably on his own inaction, weeping over the loss of his son. He even says ‘If only I had died instead of’.
33 The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”2 Sam 18: 33
Let us not regret like David, but let us make peace with all our family and friends before they are no more. We will regret and lament once they are no more. We need to muster the courage, put our pride by the side, and make peace. Make every relationship sweet again, before it is too late.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### David Mourns Absalom

[![David Mourns Absalom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day137.jpg)](https://youtu.be/MHVfctHuoZc "David Mourns Absalom")

### Day #137 Joab holding it together for David

When we are going through a difficult patch, maybe the loss of a loved one, sickness, loss of a job, or any difficult situation. We need people to help us walk the right path, amidst our inability to think straight. We see Joab is being very practical here and picking up David’s drooping spirit.
Due to David’s inaction as a father, there is a civil war in Israel, Absalom is literally coming to kill David with almost the whole of Israel. Joab takes matters into his own hands and kills Absalom when he found him hanging in the branches of the oak tree, despite David’s warning to deal gently with him. Now David is mourning the death of Absalom and cannot see clearly the misery that this Father-son tiff has brought Israel, 20K Israelites lost their lives in this civil war.
Joab would have witnessed David’s mourning and inaction – when Amnon raped Tamar and when Absalom killed Amnon. Joab was used to this mourning pattern of David and must have said “No! not again” He was able to talk some sense into David and reinstate him as King.
He asked David to focus on what he still has and not on the one son that he lost.
We need friends like Joab who are able to lift up our spirits and help us do the right thing when our vision is blurry due to us being overwhelmed. We need a "Joab" who will fight for us when we are unable to fight, who will reason for us when we are unable to think, and make us move when we are stuck. Let us pray for such friends, who will be a sturdy shelter.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also. Sirach 6:51-17
There is an increase in people with mental conditions like never before. Depression and suicide are on the rise along with mass shootings. These drastic end events like suicide, addiction and mass shootings can be averted if there are enough people like Joab who can keep others on track, and help them look outwards and not at themselves. Most of the mental sickness comes when we focus on ourselves, if we can focus on helping others we will feel much better, and we will be motivated and inspired.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Effect of Sin on Others

[![The Effect of Sin on Others](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day138.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ceKL_07GJuU "The Effect of Sin on Others")

### Day 138 Hurt for no fault of their own

We read that David has been re-instated as King and he is just settling back in. When he fleed he left 10 concubines behind to be in the house, remember Absalom wanted to show dominance over his father David and raped them in public. Now that David is back he takes them and puts them in a secure house but does not want to have anything to do with them, they live as desolate women. They have been hurt many times in their lives for no fault of their own, first off David makes them concubines – which is itself one step lower than wives. David then leaves them when he was fleeing, Absalom then rapes them in public, and now David is just leaving them to die so to speak with not even the poor status of being a concubine. They have done nothing wrong till now, but have suffered due to others' sins.
We can relate to these poor women, there are many in this world who suffer due to other people’s sins. For Ex: The children of parents who are addicted to drugs, the young girls who are sold in the flesh trade at a tender age, and The spouse who is dealing with their partner's shortcomings and addictions. The list can go on, but what can we do, we need to help them and pray for them. Jesus’ heart is moved with compassion for such people, that is why he always uplifted the widow and the orphan – they could not fend for themselves back in the day.
However, if we face a situation that would possibly bring misery on us(for none of our wrongs) we should do our best to avoid getting into such situations. Do whatever it takes to be free and avoid such loopholes. We are children of God and should not be afraid to fight for our freedom.
For some inspiration let us look at the wise woman in the reading today who saved the whole city. The backstory is that Sheba had proclaimed himself king and was being perused by King David’s army and he took refuge in a city. Joab surrounded the city and was about to destroy the whole city. A wise woman steps in and pleaded that the city be spared and that she would take care of killing Sheba. She did and saved herself and the whole city's misery. Let us be inspired and try to wiggle our way out of trouble. Let us not be quiet and bear the consequences of others' sins.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Reparation to the Gibeonites

[![Reparation to the Gibeonites](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day139.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CAD7RLyfKtU "Reparation to the Gibeonites")

### Day 139 Rather be a gatekeeper in the house of the Lord.

We read the list of names of the gatekeeper in today’s readings, one would consider it unnecessary to list them out as they are just gatekeepers. The gatekeeper task would have been a simple task of welcoming people into the temple and also maintaining general law and order, something like the tasks of the Ushers in the church today. However small the task – it is a task in the service of the Lord. It is a blessed task even though it may be seen as mundane and menial. The Psalmist says that it is a great role to consider and look forward to.
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than live in the tents of wickedness. PS 84:10
There is joy in the presence of the Lord and it's more fulfilling to even just stand at the door – doing service for the Lord. The Psalmist would not trade it for a lucrative job working at the tents of the wicked. We should not think twice about doing anything for the Lord. Even though it may seem unimportant or menial, it is done for a great Lord.
We have many examples among the saints that had simple jobs – like those of cleaning the garden or working in the kitchen of the convent. One saint that I would like to highlight is Saint André of Montreal a saint of our times, was commonly known as Brother André. He was initially rejected by the order due to his poor health.
"André was given the task of porter at Collège Notre-Dame in Côte-des-Neiges, Quebec, with additional duties as sacristan, laundry worker and messenger. "When I joined this community, the superiors showed me the door, and I remained 40 years," he said."
"His great confidence in Saint Joseph inspired him to recommend the saint's devotion to all those who were afflicted. On his many visits to the sick in their homes, he would rub the sick person lightly with oil taken from a lamp burning in the college chapel and recommend them in prayer to Saint Joseph."
People claimed that they had been cured through the prayers of the good Brother and Saint Joseph, and they were grateful their prayers had been heard. Brother André steadfastly refused to take any credit for these cures. Bessette's desire to see Saint Joseph honored led him in 1904 to launch a campaign to build a chapel for that purpose.
"When an epidemic broke out at a nearby college, André volunteered to nurse. Not one person died. The trickle of sick people to his door became a flood. His superiors were uneasy; diocesan authorities were suspicious; doctors called him a quack. "I do not cure," he said again and again. "Saint Joseph cures." In the end he needed four secretaries to handle the 80,000 letters he received each year."
Let us be inspired by St André who in a true sense was a doorkeeper at the house of the Lord, the Lord uses the weak things of this world to do great Miracles.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### David's Prayer of Thanksgiving

[![David's Prayer of Thanksgiving](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day140.jpg)](https://youtu.be/55xHDdJ_bDU "David's Prayer of Thanksgiving")

### Day #140 “Your help made me great”

David has been through a lot in his life, his life has been a roller-coaster ride, sometimes he is up and sometimes down. He was a courageous young man - one after God’s own heart, who defended his sheep from the wild animals, the brave boy who slain the giant, the harp player that dove out evil spirits, the brave soldier who slay ten thousands, he was the great king of Israel that won many battles and a prefiguration of Jesus the King of Kings. He also has his moments of weakness where he multiplied wives and concubines, gave into sloth, lusted, and committed murder, the most important thing is that he knew how to repent from his heart. Every time he went down, he prayed and repented and came right back up. He was perused many times to be killed by King Saul and even his own son Absalom. He is now too weak to go to battle escaped death by a whisker. What made King David great was not his victories or his failures but his unfailing trust in the help that came from the Lord. Another translation of the Greek word is “Gentleness”  - we are need God’s compassion and mercy – if God is not gentle and quick to judge us, we will not stand a chance. If our sins were numbered we will be long gone.

Let us also hold on to the Lord and seek his help and gentleness. We should be able to proclaim like David, that
“The lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God my rock in whom I take refuge” 2 Sam 22:2-3

We should remember that the battle belongs to the Lord, just how young boy David went up to fight the Philistine with pebbles. We should go up to fight our battles with the pebbles of the rosary, which are the mysteries of Jesus’ life. As we pray on our beeds, we can slain the giants in our lives.

Because our God is not distant or passive, but He is active always ready to come to our aid.

“He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet. He rode on a cherub and flew he was seen upon the winds of the wind.” 2Sam 22: 11-12

Let us like David at the end of our lives be in a place where we can proclaim that the Lord is faithful and our entire life is dependent on Him. He was the one who helped us and moved us through every difficulty and sin. God is our ever present help in trouble, and that we will be rewarded with Heaven. I hope and pray at the end of our lives which have been like a roller-coaster ride, we will be able to say “Your help/gentleness made me great”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Life of David

[![The Life of David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day141.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vYSQpkWZcXc "The Life of David")

### Day #141 Are you guarding your bean field?

David’s 3 Mighty Men are Josheb-basshebeth, Eleazar and Shammah.
Josheb-basshebeth he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time
(I mean Wow – try to imagine it - killing 800 men at once)
Eleazar – He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israelites withdrew, but he stood his ground. He struck down the Philistines until his arm grew weary, though his hand clung to the sword.
(Wow – Even though the whole army of Israel withdrew he stood his ground – to the point that his hand got stuck to the sword – may be due to the heat (metal hits metal) his skin stuck to the sword)
Shammah - Shammah son of Agee, the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the army fled from the Philistines. 12 But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the Lord brought about a great victory.
What struck me the most was Shammah guarding the field of lentils. He did not move he defended the plot from the Philistines. He stood in the center of the field and defended it until the Philistines fled it. Not all of us are called to do great things like to fight until the sword sticks to our hand or killing 800 men. We may be called to guard the bean field, guard our family. No matter what happens we need to stand our ground and protect our children against everything that comes their way. Never think that our task is too small or insignificant, we are all given different tasks. Take care of your little bean field, do small tasks like keeping the house tidy, doing the dishes, or picking up the kids. These small tasks done with dedication can save lives. Our God is excited when we guard our little bean field, He takes delight when he sees us caring for the people under our care.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 141 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 23:15-17
*David said longingly, “O that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”  Then the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the Lord, for he said, “The Lord forbid that I should do this. Can I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it.*

If David would have drunk the water and satisfied his desire to taste the water of his hometown, this act would probably not have been recorded in the Bible and preachers would not have mentioned it. But David did not want to selfishly enjoy the water which was obtained by the sacrifice of his men.

Like us, Jesus too had a life, but He did not spend His life fulfilling His own desires. He did not focus on His own comfort or luxury. He spent His life caring for others.
As followers of Christ we must live our lives like Him.

When we keep all God given gifts and blessings for ourselves and for our families without sharing with others, those gifts turn into our pride because we are satisfying only our own desires.  Like Jesus, we must go outside our small world, reach out to the needy ones around us, and share whatever we can with them.

### Whole and Joyful Hearts

[![Whole and Joyful Hearts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day142.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BJa4n5S_xGc "Whole and Joyful Hearts")

### Day 142 Giving Freely and whole heartily

David has the greatest relief at the end of his life, he was the King of Israel, the shepherd that led the people. He struggled with sin and committed some big ones, however, he repented and was forgiven. His greatest desire was for the House of the Lord and the presence of the Lord. Because of His multiples sins and because he was a man with bloodshed on his hands, the Lord did not permit him to build something that is holy, the temple. However, God chose one of his sons, Solomon, to do this. Solomon was young and inexperienced, so David was concerned as a father. He now opens his heart and his treasure – he keeps on giving – if we try to add up what he offered to the Lord, it would be Thousands of Billions of $$$ in our current currency.
He knew for a fact that everything that he has was from the Lord, he was a young shepherd boy with nothing when the Lord called him to be King. David would have felt such joy when he pledges a lot of his riches to the building of the temple. But the real joy would have come from seeing everyone else open up their heart to giving towards the temple. David led by example and everyone followed.
In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”Acts 20:35
It must have been such a good feeling for all of them. For it's more blessed to give than to receive. The realization that they had about all their wealth was actually what the Lord gave them, their ancestors were first slaves and then desert wanderers, the Lord brought them into the promised land, flowing with Milk and Honey.
When David asked the reason they replied as below:
“But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand. We are foreigners and strangers in your sight, as were all our ancestors. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope. Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you. 1 Cr 29:14-16
Let us also learn from them and realize that nothing that we have is our own, we have received it from the hands of the Lord. Let us be cheerful givers who give wholeheartedly of our time, talent, and treasure.
6 The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. 7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Cor 9:6-7
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 142 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 24:18 & 25
*On the same day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.*
*Then David built an altar to the LORD there, and sacrificed burnt offerings and communion offerings. The LORD granted relief to the land, and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.*

Satan put a thought in David’s mind to take a census of Israel to locate able bodied men capable of using the sword so that he could increase the strength of his physical army (1 Chronicles 21:1-5).   Therefore without consulting the Lord, David took a census of his people.  This made the Lord very angry so He sent a plague among David’s people.  Thereafter David was asked to sacrifice burnt offerings and communion offerings in atonement for his sin and the plague was withdrawn.

Very often Satan instigates us too to make choices to satisfy our will which would be against God’s Will.  Satan’s offers are always very juicy and we therefore choose to ignore God’s Will and go ahead according to our will, thus bringing suffering upon ourselves and our families.  When we realize our errors we must repent and confess our sins without delay and ensure to avoid making such choices.

*Why was Saul's sacrifice rejected by God (1 Samuel 13:13) but David’s sacrifice accepted?*

Both Saul and David offered sacrifices which only the Levitical priests had authority to do, but David (a non-Levite) also exercised a priesthood, and his priesthood was passed on to his sons (2 Samuel 8:18).  David was known to have done other priestly acts during his lifetime which only the Levitical priests had authority to do  (example :  wearing the priestly Ephod, taking care of the Ark, offering sacrifices, blessing the people in the name of the Lord) (2 Samuel 6:14-15 & 17-18) because God permitted it through the Prophet Gad (2 Samuel 24:18).

Saul, however, was not permitted to perform any priestly duties.

*But why did God permit David to perform priestly duties?*

When David conquered Jerusalem and sat on the throne (2 Samuel 5:5), he actually succeeded the previous king of Salem (Melchizedek) who was also a priest (Genesis 14:18).  Thus David opened the door and paved the way for the priesthood of the Judah tribe, to the order of Melchizedek, which later, Jesus, son of David, would hand over to His apostles to make it universal as God had originally desired (Exodus 19:6).

Like David, Jesus was also 30 years old when he became king and priest (2 Samuel 5:4).
At Jerusalem, David reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years (2 Samuel 5:5), which was the full span of the life of Jesus, son of David, and King of the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 24:24
*“I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”*

David wanted to buy that place to offer his sacrifice. Araunah was not going to charge David anything, but David insisted on paying for it.  He did not want to offer God anything that cost him nothing.

It is easy to serve God when we give our excess.
Sacrificing to God means that it must cost us something.
We can sacrifice our hearts and time to do God’s work.  He wants people to give themselves to Him, willingly and completely.  He wants their time and their abilities to do His work.
To sacrifice something means to give up something we love the most or something that we are attached to.  It must cost us something, otherwise it is not really a sacrifice.
We can sacrifice our entertainment time to serve God or we can give up our children to the service of God (religious).  We can share what we have with the less fortunate ones even if we have to do with less.

We have to decide on what and how much we are willing to give God.

### Solomon Asks for Wisdom

[![Solomon Asks for Wisdom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day143.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6GFmA45ExtI "Solomon Asks for Wisdom")

### Day 143 Asking God for the right things

We read this very famous event where Solomon asks for wisdom. At night God appears to Solomon and said “Ask what I shall give thee.” Solomon’s answered
10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 2 Ch 1:10
God was so pleased with Solomon’s answer.
11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. 2Ch 1: 11-12
Solomon received wisdom but that did not automatically make him perfect, it just made him wise. Now wisdom can be used for good or bad, he uses it to do things that the Lord did not command. Like, amass horses and chariots and horses from Egpyt.
There are two lessons to learn here, Asking for the right things in prayer and being obedient to God’s commands, or else all our talents and efforts are in vain.
Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge from the Lord and everything else was added on like riches, wealth, and honor. In the same way, we need to seek first the Kingdom of God and everything else will be added on. When we pray we should ask for God’s presence, love, and mercy in our lives, every other thing will be added in.
Some people when they pray are only praying prayers of petition and request, some even are trying to make a deal with the Lord and say – “If you answer this prayer, I will do this good deed” we should not worry too much about earthly things -they will be added on when we ask for Jesus himself. If you have the King – the whole kingdom will be granted.

But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Mat 6:33
Let us ask God for wisdom and understanding, not just that but the grace to live a life according to his calling and his Word.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 143 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 1:38
*So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and Pelethites went down, and mounting Solomon on King David’s mule, escorted him to Gihon.  Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!”*

This was a foreshadow of Jesus, the King of the heavenly Davidic Kingdom, riding a donkey when he entered Jerusalem (traditionally known as Palm Sunday) and the people followed him greeting him with palms and shouting with joy “Hosanna to the son of David.”

Riding a donkey was a sign of humility and David wanted to show the people that Solomon was a humble king, as opposed to Adonijah who was a warrior.

### David's Last Words

[![David's Last Words](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day144.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zjHCD_vlRUA "David's Last Words")

### Day #144 Queen Mother

For the very first time, we are introduced to the concept of "Queen mother". Before Bathsheba is made Queen, she is just the wife of the King. While David is still King and very old we see Bathsheba entering his chamber, let us try to picture this.
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 1 Kings 1:16
She came to remind the King that her son Solomon was the chosen one to be the next King. Nathan the prophet re-iterated the fact and King David called for Bathsheba and told her the plan to install Solomon as King.
31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.1 Kings 1: 31
We see that Bathsheba is bowing before the king and is reverent before the King.
Now King Solomon is installed as King and Bathsheba became the queen. In the Jewish Kingdoms, the Kings had many wives and the wife of the king was not the queen as the kings had many wives and concubines. The mother of the King is the Queen. That is why we see the difference in the way she approaches the king now.
19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 1 King 2:19
We see that Bathsheba is no long bowing before the King, in fact the King rose up and bowed before her. He then gave her a seat to sit at the right hand. Sitting at the right-hand means that the person is second only to the King. She is being honored as the Queen the one who is just below the King. The King being her son bows down to honor his mom. As we journey more through the bible we will hopefully see this pattern.
This will culminate in Revelations 12 where we see the Queen of Heaven, the Ark of the covenant, and Jesus’ dear mom Mary. She is crowned with 12 stars on her head, with the moon under her feet and clothed with the son.
A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1
May we be led to learn more about our dear Mother Mary, she does not want any glory. Her words are “I am a handmaid of the Lord”, “My soul magnifies the Lord”, and “Do as he says, listen to him”. Let us be humble like Mother Mary so God can lift us up to heaven. We cannot understand Mary as Queen of heaven if we put on our 21st-century glasses where the first lady is the wife of the president, we got to put on our OT glasses of the Jewish Kingdom structure where the mother of the King is the Queen.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 144 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 2:13-22
In the earthly Davidic kingdom of the old Covenant, when Solomon, son of David, was crowned king, he had a throne kept at his right, for the queen, and the queen was his mother, not his wife.  Thereafter, in Judea, every king had a queen and, by default, the queen was always the king’s mother, not his wife.  Solomon’s mother held a regal office in the kingdom.  She was known as the “Gebirah” (the “Great Lady” or “Queen Mother”).

This was a fore shadow or prototype of the new Covenant kingdom.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom of the new Covenant, Jesus is the King. Therefore, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom, His mother becomes the Queen, by default and she would sit on a throne at the right hand of her son, Christ the King.

Most of the petitions from the people would come to King Solomon through his mother, who was the intercessor between the king and the people.  The petitions presented by the Queen Mother were given first preference by the royal son, but the decision always rested with the royal son.

In the heavenly Davidic kingdom, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the intercessor between God’s people and her royal Son.  Jesus will always give first preference to the petitions presented by His Queen Mother.

Bathsheba’s petition was, however, rejected by King Solomon because she took an ungodly petition to him.

Jesus will never reject His mother’s petitions.  He will always grant the petitions presented by His mother, having lived His earthly life with her for 33 years and knowing fully well that His mother would never ask Him to do something against God’s Will.  The same mother, who at a young age was ready to go through suffering, and sacrificed her only Son to save the world, in obedience to God’s Will; the same mother who taught Him to live His life according to God’s Will so that God was very pleased with Him.  We have an earthly example of this when Mary took the people’s petition to her Son during the wedding at Cana (John 2:3) but she insisted on the people obeying her Son (John 2:5).

Therefore, whether we ask Mary for spiritual gifts, or material gifts, or to help us through our sufferings, etc. she will take our petitions to her Son only if our request is in accordance with God’s Will.

Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all the rest will be given unto you (Matthew 6:33).

### Day #145 Doing things with great precision

Just love the way King Solomon executes the blueprint that was handed down to him for the building of the temple. He is doing everything with great precision just as the Lord had instructed, silver where silver was needed, gold where old was needed, all the furniture fittings, the lampstands, the list goes on. Followed the prescribed way of transporting the ark of the covenant, the Levities/priests carried it.
When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. 2 Ch 5: 4,5
The Lord was very pleased with the dedication Solomon showed towards the building of the temple. The Lord was very pleased with the Israelites, for they had earlier opened their hearts to give towards the temple. We know the Lord was very pleased because of the cloud of smoke that filled the temple, which is an indication of the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord was so strong in the temple that because of the smoke the priest could not perform their duties.
Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud, and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God. 2 Ch 5: 14
King Solomon did that one great thing that the Lord was calling him to do. Did it with great dedication and precision.
What is the Lord calling me to do today? What is that one thing that the Lord is calling you to do? Maybe more than one great thing or one small thing or a bunch of little things that the Lord is calling you to do.
Maybe you are called to share God’s word, be a musician or singer for the Lord, be a Eucharistic Minister or Usher, Maybe God wants you to be a priest or religious, maybe you are called to do charity or be part of service ministry by feeding the poor, maybe you're called to be a good listener, a good husband or wife, a good parent, maybe your called to be a good example at your workplace.
It's up to us to identify our calling, we should listen carefully and seek God’s plan. Once we know our calling, we should do it with great dedication and precision. We should never lose sight of our goal, keep moving on, and with God’s help achieve it.
“God does not call us to be successful, He calls us to be faithful. Faithfulness and dedication are success even if we do not achieve what we want”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day #146 Let your faith life exceed the Sunday obligation

We know that King Solomon built the temple with great precision, and it pleased the Lord. But the building is not everything, dedicating it and active sacrifice followed. The Temple was established as the central place to worship, everyone needed to go up there to worship. This caused a lot of activity and a lot of prayer and sacrifice, a lot of celebration, atonement for sins, and spending time in the presence of the Lord. King Solomon was instrumental in really getting the people together and united in prayer for the Lord. The amount of food that was offered and prepared there was enormous, showing a sign of how active the temple was.
The temple was full of life and abundance. Just like the temple described in Ezekiel where the river flowing from the temple brought life wherever it went.
Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there. It will become fresh; and everything will live where the river goes. Ez 47:9
We can compare two things to the temple of God

1. Our Parish

2. Our faith lives

Our Parish should be a place of refuge, a place for prayer and worship of God, and a place where the sacrifice of the Mass is offered. There is something about getting dressed and leaving our homes to go to a central place for worship, it puts our hearts in the right state to worship God – opposed to saying I’m just going to stay in my PJs and pray in my room. The church is a place for community worship, a central place where we can join our brothers and sisters in Christ. It’s not about how good the building looks, a posh church in the developed world can seem dull as compared to a shack of a building in a third world country – what matters are the people and their faith, not the building. I am so blessed to be part of a very active parish – the building is beautiful and so is the faith community. My advice – find one or make your parish into one.
Our faith lives should go beyond the Sunday obligation, the bare minimum. If you take lessons to learn an instrument once a week and do not practice all week, you will never progress you will be stuck in a rut. In the same way, we cannot just survive on the Sunday Obligation, just offering 1 hour a week to God will not get you anywhere.
We are the temple of God now in the New Testament, our hearts need to be active and vibrant – constantly abiding in the presence of the Lord. By doing the BIAY we are already beyond that basic stage, dedicating 20-30 mins every day is truly something that you should be proud about. But it does not stop here, we should continue to practice the presence of the Lord in our lives, praising him always and praying unceasingly. The River of the Holy Spirit should flow from our hearts bringing life to everyone we encounter.
Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 1 Cor 6:19
Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus. 1 Th 5:16-18
Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them. John 7:38
Let us go beyond the Sunday obligation to the point where we are becoming the temple of God, constantly praying, rejoicing and the springs of living waters, the Holy Spirit will flow from our hearts.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Temple Worship

[![Temple Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day147.jpg)](https://youtu.be/eT_LS60gAZ8 "Temple Worship")

### Day #147 He will heal our land

This question has been asked repeatedly through the centuries. Whenever there is an evil act such as a shooting, war, or rape. One usually asks where was God when this evil was happening.
There are times when children are harmed or the venerable are hurt. The question Where was God? This question is trying to show God as incapable of action or not in control of things.
However, the question to ask is why has humanity come to this? God is not the one who is committing evil, the evil starts in human hearts and turns into actions.
God is working with fallen humans, he is trying to get us to the right path, to walk in Jesus’s steps. Through the centuries of sin, evil, and hatred God is slowly teaching us, humans, the right path. Step by step and little by little.
God gives us the freedom to choose Good over evil, he has always given us freedom starting with Adam and Eve, but we keep choosing evil. It’s human weakness that has caused so much evil in the world today. However no matter how many times we fail as humans; God invites us, again and again, to repent and go back to him. So that he can restore us back to what we are called to be.
God invites us again as he invited the Israelites under King Solomon.
if my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Ch 7:14
We desperately need God’s healing in our homes, towns, cities, and countries. Let us be united in prayer as we seek God’s face and as we repent and ask the Lord to forgive us. If we sincerely pray and repent, we will have heaven on earth. God will hear us from heaven forgive our sins and heal our land.
Also remember if we ask God to act with force towards those who commit evil, it will be unbearable and we will be afraid of God. God does not want us to follow him out of fear but out of love.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 147 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Chronicles 7:12-15
\*The LORD appeared to Solomon during the night and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for my house of sacrifice.”\*

In the old Covenant God chose the Temple for the prescribed sacrifices to be offered to Him.
In the new Covenant God has chosen the Church for the prescribed sacrifice to be offered to Him.

\*The LORD said to Solomon, “If I close heaven so that there is no rain, if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, if then my people, upon whom my name has been pronounced, humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their evil ways, I will hear them from heaven and pardon their sins and heal their land.\*

God gave Solomon a warning regarding the consequences which he and his people would have to face if they disobeyed God’s commandments.  But since God is merciful He gave Solomon the solution as well, on how they could overcome the consequences.

But this warning was not only for Solomon and his people.  It is valid for all generations until the end of time.

God is fully aware of whatever sicknesses, disasters, problems, etc. we face on individual level, local level or global level.  He may have allowed it as a test for our faith or most likely due to the increase of the mortal sins of Christians, the ones on whom His name has been pronounced (during baptism).  God does not allow evil unless He can draw some good from it.

During such times God does not wait for us to wake Him up and tell Him to stop or change what is happening.  He waits for us to repent, confess our sins and ensure that our souls are sanctified.  He waits for us to come back to Him and build a relationship with Him.

Let us therefore ensure to repent, confess our sins and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that a misfortune may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death.

On the other hand, if we are leading holy lives according to God’s Will, then we can continue as we are and we don’t have to worry about the destiny of our souls in the event of unexpected death.

\*Now, therefore, my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place; for now I have chosen and consecrated this house that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart shall be there always.\*

God heard every prayer that went up from the Temple, and God hears every prayer that goes up from the Church as well, but His answer to our prayers will always come in His time, not in the time we expect.

In the old Covenant, God dwelt in the Temple in His divinity.
In the new Covenant, God dwells in the Church in His humanity in the Bread of life / Eucharist, and will continue until the end of time.

2 Chronicles 8:4-8
As commanded by God, the sinful Canaanites were supposed to be driven out of the land or destroyed completely but Solomon didn't do anything like that. Instead he was very soft with them.  Besides imposing heavy taxes on them he didn't make any attempt to get rid of them.  The Canaanites gradually re-introduced idolatry in the country and the Israelites started living sinful lives under their influence thus bringing disaster upon themselves.

Sometimes we too fail to uproot the small sins in our daily lives and we become comfortable living with them. We gradually start convincing ourselves that it is okay to continue as long as we are not harming anyone. Those small sins then gradually progress to mortal sins and we don't even realize when we started walking hand in hand with the devil, thus bringing eternal disaster upon ourselves. Therefore, however small a sin may be, it is always wiser to "nip it in the bud" by making a firm decision to stop it immediately, before it is too late.

### Solomon's Wealth

[![Solomon's Wealth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day148.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kmIvP9xPs4E "Solomon's Wealth")

### Day #148 Enter the Holy of Holies.

As we read through the construction details of the temple, one cannot help but put on sunglasses to look at the temple. It’s loaded with Gold, tailor-cut stone, and all the fittings, and finishing are of the best quality. If it was still around it would have easily beat the Taj Mahal to the 7 wonders of the world. Picture the most splendid buildings that you have ever seen, and it would fail in splendor to the temple that Solomon built, Solomon was just an instrument the blueprint was given by the Lord.
Even though the temple was “out of this world” it fails in comparison to what Jesus did for us.
In the OT when people made a pilgrimage to the temple to offer sacrifice, they would not be able to go into the holy of holies. They had to visit the temple courts and pray, offer their sacrifice and leave. Only select priests would be able to go into the holy of Holies.
Jesus our new High priest made a way for us, He is both the priest and the sacrifice, He offered himself once and for all. He opened the way for, He is the gate that we can enter to go to the promised land. When Jesus gave up His spirit, the veil of the temple was torn.
Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last. At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. Mat 27:50-51
The curtains/veil was the section that separated the common area to the Holy of Holies. Jesus by His life death and resurrection – atones for our sins. The tearing of the curtains can be considered symbolic that Jesus made a way for us to enter the Holy of Holies. He gives us full access to God, to the Holy Trinity. We are allowed to enter the Holy of Holies – the sanctuary where Jesus is present in the truest form. We no longer must stay outside the temple; we are welcome to go close to Jesus – into His presence. In the Holy of Holies of the New Testament, we have Jesus’s consecrated body – He is truly present in each host – body blood soul, and divinity (transubstantiation).
Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
Heb 10:19 -20
The next time we enter the church remember that it is such a gift to be able to just walk into the Holy of Holies. Let me say it again “IT IS SUCH A GIFT”. The price that was paid for our entry into the Holy of Holies is very high, Jesus’s life death, and resurrection. Let us go rejoicing into Church knowing that we are welcome, we are chosen and God wants us close to Him. The Holy Eucharist even though it looks simple, is spiritually enriching and the brightest and most radiant as it is Jesus, the Light of the world. The temple in all its splendor is just an icon/ a symbol of the every brilliant Jesus. If see all His splendor we will become blind like Saul-Paul, that is why Jesus has pity on us and we are able to look at the host in bread form although it is fully Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 148 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 6:7
*The Temple was built of stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or axe or iron tool was heard in the Temple during its construction.*

The old Covenant Temple was a shadow of the Body of Christ (John 2:21; Revelation 21:22) therefore God did not want any tool to be used on the Temple site because the Body of Christ was to be scourged and crucified only once.
Also, God does not dwell in noisy places.  God dwells only where there is silence (1 Kings 19:12-13), therefore the construction of the Temple was done with minimum noise.

The stones represent Christians who are like cells in the Body of Christ.
The stones needed to be cut and shaped at the quarry, away from the Temple, till they would be good enough to become part of the Temple.

Similarly, when Christians go away from Christ, because of their mortal sins, they need to be purified through the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) outside of the Mass, before they can receive the Eucharist (Communion) (1 Corinthians 11:27-29) to become part of the Body of Christ again.

1 Kings 6:38
King Solomon built the Temple exactly as per the specifications given by God to King David.  If Solomon had modified the specifications to suit his whims and fancies, he would have been disobeying God’s command and that would have been a disaster because it would have displeased the Lord.  But because he followed every detail which God had given to King David, God was pleased with Solomon and God came to dwell in the Temple.  Solomon’s Temple therefore came to be known as the most magnificent work, such as was never seen before, because it was the work of human hands done with divine inspiration.

Similarly, the Word of God (the Bible) has been written by human authors with divine inspiration.  Any modification to the Word of God will be a disaster for those who modify it.

### DAY 148 by Sheila

In the Book of Kings, Solomon's Temple, so beautiful was the fulfillment of God's Promise to make a place for His Name to dwell and to give lsrael her own Country a permanent place to Worship God.
The Cherubims were Angels to reflect God's Glory, The Inner Sanctuary, The Most Holy Place, The Presence of God's Dwelling.
Chronicle reveals the Wealth, Wisdom and Extent of Solomon's Kingdom with tremendous Worldwide Recognition.
But Solomon led astray personally, his pagan wives, his entire family was corrupted not following God's Law. The Death of Solomon, was buried with his fathers in the City of David.
The Psalm is of faith and trust in God.. Sacrifices of Righteousness are those offered with the right attitude and God's protection comes to those who put their hope and trust in God.

### All Is Vanity

[![All Is Vanity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day149.jpg)](https://youtu.be/iblNnsD_p5E "All Is Vanity")

### Day #149 All is vanity

I’m sure we have come across people who have burnt out their lives trying to amass wealth, houses, cars… We have seen some perusing fame and popularity – doing anything to be on top. We have seen many who try to leave a legacy when they die. Those who want to enjoy all the pleasures that money can buy. None of those will bring us lasting joy, even if we get all the money in the world, all the pleasures in this world, even if we are the most popular person in town. We will not be satisfied. Let me say it again “Nothing of this world will satisfy us”. We have seen so many of the rich and famous commit suicide. Most of them need to be on meds/drugs and are depressed.
We read the story of the King who had it all, all the wealth, wisdom, legacy, pleasures but all of it was but a wind, a vapor, all is vanity.
This King gathered silver and gold, and slaves, built houses, bought vineyards, had singers, wine, and concubines, he had all the wisdom under the sun. The outcome is this piece of wisdom.
“Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toils I had spent in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun” Ecc 2:11
If our life was going to end here on earth, then it would be so unsatisfactory. All the things we gather, all the experiences, all the toil, all the pleasures, nothing is long-lasting – it will all get blown away in the wind.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mk 8:36
Our life does not end here on earth, our destination is heaven. Live this life focused on the next and you will be satisfied, our focus should be to live a life that pleases God.
“For to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy” Ecc 2:26
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Dedication of the Temple

[![The Dedication of the Temple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day150.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z01qQFrR49k "The Dedication of the Temple")

### Day #150 A time for everything

There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:
a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
Just reading this scripture brings so much peace. In our earthly lives, we will face different situations, phases, seasons, and experiences. One does not have to be smiling all the time, there are times when we will mourn when we will be silent, we are called to have joy – joy is that inner peace that will not leave us even if we are going through a storm. The inner peace that knows that God is in control.
Everything will eventually pass away, if everything is going right in your life now, it will go away and you will have problems and worries. If you’re having problems and worries that will also pass and you will have peace. Our life is a rollercoaster ride, we will go through difficulties and happiness, peace and war, time to move, and time to stay. But the one thing that will never change is God. God is the same forever, He will never change.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.Heb 13:8
The best way to ride the waves of life is to stay close to Jesus. Jesus never changes He is always the same and is always next to us. It is important to mourn when we lose a loved one. It is important to move on sometimes in our life. It is important to take on new opportunities and do new things. It is also important to hold onto things that are good. It is important to hold onto good relationships and to discard those that are not beneficial for you. (the goal is that we all grow closer to God as we learn to love each other)
Keep moving forwards knowing that Jesus is the same and He is with you. Right now it's time to rejoice because you completed reading 150 days of the Bible. Hurray!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 150 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 8:10-11
The Lord came down to dwell with His people in Solomon’s Temple in the form of a glory cloud.

In the new Covenant the Lord comes down to dwell in the Tabernacle with His people.

1 Kings 8:17-19
*My father David had it in mind to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.  But the Lord said to my father David, ‘You did well to consider building a house for my name; nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’*

David had a strong desire to build a house / Temple for the Lord but he was not allowed to build it, so his son Solomon faithfully fulfilled his desire and God was pleased with Solomon.

When we have a desire to do something in life but we are unable to do it due to unavoidable circumstances, we feel so happy to see our children dedicating themselves to fulfill our dreams.
But do we, God's children, think of dedicating ourselves to fulfill the desire of our heavenly Father to help the growth of His Kingdom (the Church) on earth?

### Wisdom and Folly

[![Wisdom and Folly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day151.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NrL3YU5CSJc "Wisdom and Folly")

### Day #151 Do not pay attention to every word people say

“Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you— for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.” Ecc 7:21-22
This is excellent advice to our very self-obsessed generation. Compared to the previous generations, we have become very self-conscious about what others think about us. We care too much about others' opinions, sometimes we can go to the extent of shaping our lives based on what people think.
We are worried that our neighbor's lawn is greener than ours, that our friends are making more money than us, that our siblings are more successful than us, and we are afraid to wear certain clothes as it makes us look thick(see I had to think before writing fat). We are so concerned that our phones are the latest model and that are cars are posh enough.
“What do people think of me?” has even entered the spiritual circles. We hear homilies that are sweet and politically correct.
We seldom hear homilies spoken with conviction that causes people to repent (Although there have been homilies that have cut to the heart and caused me to repent) We do not hear the call to repentance as we read it in the Gospel. Like Peter preached on Pentecost “Save yourselves from this crooked generation!” and we do not hear that response “What should we do to be saved”.
We all try to be so pious and good in front of others but are gossiping and slandering our very “so-called” spiritual friends behind their back. We need to break ourselves free from the shackles that cause us to portray a perfect picture of ourselves. We need to realize that we are all broken, all are fallen and in need of a savior. Let us not be overly concerned about what others think of us, God looks into our hearts and knows us through and through.
Let us shout it out from the rooftops, and tell everyone not to be concerned about what others think.
“Save yourselves from this crooked generation!” Acts 2:40
Just live the best life you can. What others think about us is their problem.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. ✌️

### BIAY Day 151 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Kings 9:10-13
The Solomonic Temple was designed by God, revealed to David (in a dream) who handed it over to Solomon to construct it. However, the actual construction of the Temple was carried out by the laborers of Hiram, the prince of Tyre, who was not only a gentile but a descendant of the Canaanites.

At Sinai, God's people were commanded to avoid the gentile Canaanites.

At Zion, God's people hired the gentile Canaanites to help them in building God's Temple and Solomon later gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

Thus, by uniting the Jews and the gentiles politically and geographically, Solomon was gradually moving towards the reversal of Babel which would finally be fulfilled on Pentecost Sunday.

### Being Forgotten

[![Being Forgotten](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day152.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wrYUXll61KM "Being Forgotten")

### Day #152 The living know they will die, and the dead know nothing.

“The living know they will die, and the dead know nothing.” Ecc 9:5
One of the best revelations that one can receive is the fact that we are just sojourners on earth.
This is not our destination; this is the road that we are to travel. Our citizenship is in heaven or hell, our goal in the earthly life is to get to heaven and take as many as we can.
For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 19 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. 20 But our citizenship is in heaven. Ph 3:18
Both Ecclesiastics and St Paul are sorting people into two categories. Those who are only concerned about the earthly life and those who are focused on the next life. We can see those who live for their bellies and the vain glory. Those who are laser-focused on this earthly life and everything that it has to offer. Their destiny is destruction – they will never find satisfaction on earth no matter how much of earthly things they receive. They live life as though there is no tomorrow, like they will never die. Just living in the moment and chasing after everything that glitters.
On the other hand, those who know they will die. Those are the ones who say this world and all its things are passing away. We will die and will be forgotten. All their actions and thoughts are in preparation for the next world. With the focus on the next world, we will experience heaven on earth. For we stop focusing on the earthly stuff we have, the stuff we need, our temporary earthly suffering rather learn life lessons from them.
One self-test that we can do is to list all our prayers and sort into two categories, prayers for this world vs prayers for next world.
For Ex: Prayer for this world - physical healing, finances {Note: these are genuine prayers and should be prayed}
Prayers for the next world – prayers for breakthrough from sin, prayers for the fruits of the Spirit, for wisdom.
As we list out the prayers we may be able to see if we are focused on this world or the next.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
