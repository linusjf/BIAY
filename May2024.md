### Abner Is Killed

[![Abner Is Killed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day122.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6PkwdySN5sg "Abner Is Killed")

### Day 122 Revenge should not be encouraged

A little back story will help us understand why Joab assistants Abner. Abner was Saul’s commander, after Saul died Abner took one of Saul’s sons - Ish-bosheth, and made him King of Israel. Fierce war breaks out between David’s men and Ish-bosheth’s army. Now Abner was one of the main commanders, David’s men were winning, and Abner and his men were running away. Now Asahel was a fast runner who ran like a wild gazelle. Abner warned Abner to not peruse him because he did not want to kill him. Asahel did not listen and Abner killed him in self-defense. This is fair play as far as war rules go.
Now Ish-bosheth accuses Abner, Abner was the one who originally installed Ish-bosheth, and decides to leave and join forces with David. David welcomes him and I’m sure they would eventually overturn Ish-bosheth.
However Joab has other plans, he calls Abner aside and kills him. Joab has revenge in his heart, he wanted to avenge his brother Asahel’s death. This is very sheepish of him to kill the great commander Abner without a proper fight.
King David does not accept this, being a just and truthful person, he calls a public fast. He even invites Joab to repent of his sin and mourn.
David’s lament song tells the whole story
Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze shackles. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. 2 Sam 24
We should take a public stand for everything that is unjust. For example: We need to take a stand as a Pro-Life supporter and do everything that we can to protect innocent unborn children from being murdered. Whenever there is evil done, we need to boldly reject it and take a stand against all violence, racism, hate crime, bullying, and injustice. Let us not be ashamed about our stance on sin or evil.
May The Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 122 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 4:9-10
*Jabez became the most distinguished of his brothers.*
*At birth his mother had named him Jabez, saying, “I bore him with pain.”*
*Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: “Oh, that you may truly bless me and extend my boundaries!  May your hand be with me and make me free of misfortune, without pain!” And God granted his prayer.*

The life and prayer of Jabez teaches us that our origins don't determine our destinies, and our requests should reflect the greatness of our God, not the smallness of our own expectations.

If you are labelled as a "*pain*" or by any other negative nickname, by people around you, simply cry out to the Lord, like Jabez, and ask Him to release you of this curse. The Lord of Jabez will surely hear you and answer you, even if there’s a delay, just as He did for Jabez.

*“Bless me and extend my boundaries.”*
Let us ask God to bless us and extend our spiritual boundaries.

*“May your hand be with me.”*
Let us pray to God for His guidance in everything we do.

*“Make me free of misfortune.”*
Let us pray to God to protect us from evil.

*“Make me free of pain.”*
Let us pray to God to help us to break the curse of sins in our lives by making true repentance.

### The Death of Ish-bosheth

[![The Death of Ish-bosheth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rC1H0abVdlM "The Death of Ish-bosheth")

### Day 123 Be a person of good character

While David’s public mourning of Abner(unjustly assassinated) is fresh in our minds, we see another incident that shows us more of David’s good character. When Ish-bosheth heard the news of Abner’s death, his courage failed. He was sleeping in his chamber and two of his own captains of raiding bands assassinated him(Ish-bosheth their own King) They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David hoping for a reward and possible position in David’s army. If David was any other king of those times, he would have welcomed them and thanked them for killing his enemy. However, the only reward David gave them is death.
David again is demonstrating great character, he is a just King(at least till now) – one who is pre-figuring Jesus the king of kings. David does not want injustice to happen even to his enemies.
Doesn’t this remind us of Jesus' teaching
43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. Mat 5:43-45
We are called to be people of good character, not just from an outward appearance but from the inside. All our actions flow from the heart, we need to have a clean heart. A heart that is just and fair, a heart that does not have partiality, a heart that genuinely wants the good of others.
Let us pray and ask for this new heart of flesh that is promised in Ezekiel.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. Ez 36:26
We see that David has this pure heart now, but later he commits sin and finds corruption in his heart that is why he prays.
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Ps 51:10
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
