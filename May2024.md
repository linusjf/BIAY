### Abner Is Killed

[![Abner Is Killed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day122.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6PkwdySN5sg "Abner Is Killed")

### Day 122 Revenge should not be encouraged

A little back story will help us understand why Joab assistants Abner. Abner was Saul’s commander, after Saul died Abner took one of Saul’s sons - Ish-bosheth, and made him King of Israel. Fierce war breaks out between David’s men and Ish-bosheth’s army. Now Abner was one of the main commanders, David’s men were winning, and Abner and his men were running away. Now Asahel was a fast runner who ran like a wild gazelle. Abner warned Abner to not peruse him because he did not want to kill him. Asahel did not listen and Abner killed him in self-defense. This is fair play as far as war rules go.
Now Ish-bosheth accuses Abner, Abner was the one who originally installed Ish-bosheth, and decides to leave and join forces with David. David welcomes him and I’m sure they would eventually overturn Ish-bosheth.
However Joab has other plans, he calls Abner aside and kills him. Joab has revenge in his heart, he wanted to avenge his brother Asahel’s death. This is very sheepish of him to kill the great commander Abner without a proper fight.
King David does not accept this, being a just and truthful person, he calls a public fast. He even invites Joab to repent of his sin and mourn.
David’s lament song tells the whole story
Should Abner die as a fool dies? Your hands were not bound, your feet not placed in bronze shackles. You fell like one who falls victim to criminals. 2 Sam 24
We should take a public stand for everything that is unjust. For example: We need to take a stand as a Pro-Life supporter and do everything that we can to protect innocent unborn children from being murdered. Whenever there is evil done, we need to boldly reject it and take a stand against all violence, racism, hate crime, bullying, and injustice. Let us not be ashamed about our stance on sin or evil.
May The Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 122 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 4:9-10
*Jabez became the most distinguished of his brothers.*
*At birth his mother had named him Jabez, saying, “I bore him with pain.”*
*Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: “Oh, that you may truly bless me and extend my boundaries!  May your hand be with me and make me free of misfortune, without pain!” And God granted his prayer.*

The life and prayer of Jabez teaches us that our origins don't determine our destinies, and our requests should reflect the greatness of our God, not the smallness of our own expectations.

If you are labelled as a "*pain*" or by any other negative nickname, by people around you, simply cry out to the Lord, like Jabez, and ask Him to release you of this curse. The Lord of Jabez will surely hear you and answer you, even if there’s a delay, just as He did for Jabez.

*“Bless me and extend my boundaries.”*
Let us ask God to bless us and extend our spiritual boundaries.

*“May your hand be with me.”*
Let us pray to God for His guidance in everything we do.

*“Make me free of misfortune.”*
Let us pray to God to protect us from evil.

*“Make me free of pain.”*
Let us pray to God to help us to break the curse of sins in our lives by making true repentance.

### The Death of Ish-bosheth

[![The Death of Ish-bosheth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day123.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rC1H0abVdlM "The Death of Ish-bosheth")

### Day 123 Be a person of good character

While David’s public mourning of Abner(unjustly assassinated) is fresh in our minds, we see another incident that shows us more of David’s good character. When Ish-bosheth heard the news of Abner’s death, his courage failed. He was sleeping in his chamber and two of his own captains of raiding bands assassinated him(Ish-bosheth their own King) They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David hoping for a reward and possible position in David’s army. If David was any other king of those times, he would have welcomed them and thanked them for killing his enemy. However, the only reward David gave them is death.
David again is demonstrating great character, he is a just King(at least till now) – one who is pre-figuring Jesus the king of kings. David does not want injustice to happen even to his enemies.
Doesn’t this remind us of Jesus' teaching
43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 that you may be children of your Father in heaven. Mat 5:43-45
We are called to be people of good character, not just from an outward appearance but from the inside. All our actions flow from the heart, we need to have a clean heart. A heart that is just and fair, a heart that does not have partiality, a heart that genuinely wants the good of others.
Let us pray and ask for this new heart of flesh that is promised in Ezekiel.
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. Ez 36:26
We see that David has this pure heart now, but later he commits sin and finds corruption in his heart that is why he prays.
Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Ps 51:10
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### King David Rules

[![King David Rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day124.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7EU6urkQGbI "King David Rules")

### Day 124 By Cynthia D'Silva

2 Samuel 5:1-4
*Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, “Look, we are your bone and flesh.”*
By recalling Adam's words (Genesis 2:23) Israel, the bride of God, chose David as their bridegroom King.  Saul was the first man chosen for this role but he failed.  David was the second one and the leaders accepted him.
But David was only a shadow of the real heavenly bridegroom King, Jesus.

*David was thirty years old when the leaders of the twelve tribes crowned him king.  Thereafter he made a Covenant with the leaders of the twelve tribes and started his office.*
Jesus was 30 years old when He started His ministry (Luke 3:23) and 33 years old when He was declared a king by the people (John 12:13). Thereafter He made a Covenant with His twelve Apostles in the Upper Room (Matthew 26:28).
Priests and kings had to be minimum thirty years of age to start their work because, according to the Jewish culture, thirty years was considered to be the age of maturity / wisdom.

The establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the old Covenant and God chose David to be the priest (2 Samuel 24:18 & 25), prophet (Acts 2:29-30) and king (2 Samuel 5:3), all three in one, the prototype of Jesus and the patriarch of the kingdom.  Thus, Jesus becomes the true “Son of David.”

Likewise, the establishment of the kingdom was the climax of the new Covenant and Jesus, the Son of David, was chosen by God to be the Priest (Hebrews 7:15-17; Revelation 1:13), Prophet (Matthew 13:57) and King (John 12:13-15) of the heavenly Kingdom.

2 Samuel 5:6-9
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/2Samuel/5/6-9>

After King David conquered the enemies (the Jebusites), took over the earthly Jerusalem and sat on the throne, he brought the Ark of the Covenant up to the earthly Jerusalem in a liturgical procession with the priests carrying the Ark (2 Samuel 6:2). Thereafter, David made Jerusalem, not just a political capital, but also a spiritual capital, the place where all pilgrims, Jews and gentiles, were invited to worship their one true heavenly Father.  This was a foreshadow of the new Covenant.

When Jesus conquered the enemy (Satan), and sat on the throne in Heaven, He opened the gates of the new Jerusalem (the Church) where all humanity, Jews and gentiles, are invited to worship their one true heavenly Father. Some decades later He took the Ark of the new Covenant (His Mother) up to the heavenly Jerusalem.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

### Day #124 “One thing I ask of the Lord is to dwell in the house of the Lord forever”

Christianity is not a set of concepts or philosophy or principles or protocols it is a relationship, the ultimate relationship between God and man. The beauty of the Christian life is that God is with us always and forever. Jesus gave us this promise that “He will be with us forever till the end of days”. In the OT we have the promise that even if a mother forsakes a child, God will not leave us.
The key is for us to stay close to God. One definition of sin is
“God, I know what you want me to do, but I want to do what I want. “
Jesus thought us in the parable of the vine and the branches that we are branches and we need to abide in the Vine if not we will wither up.
David so far is being very obedient, constantly seeking God’s will in every battle he fights.
David knows the importance of God’s presence, that is why he prays the most important prayer “to dwell in the house of the Lord forever” being united with God was David’s strength. We also need to develop this attitude to be aware of God’s presence in our lives and cherish prayer time. We need to develop our relationship with the Lord, He is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. We need to hear the voice of the Good Shepherd and follow him. We need to be united to the Vine and receive all the needed nutrients from the Lord.
Jesus is always standing at the door of our hearts and is willing to come in if we invite Him.
We have to be aware and cautious to not let sin creep into our lives.
We see that David is starting to lose his way as he decides to do his own things by taking on many wives and concubines which was forbidden for kings (forbidden for Israel’s Kings appointed by God) we will see that this will become David’s downfall soon.
May the Holy Spirit protect us from sin and lead us.🙏

### Covenant with David

[![Covenant with David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day125.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VVaAc2gyYgo "Covenant with David")

### Day #125 Mary the New Ark of the covenant

In today’s reading, the most important thing to call out is this parallel between the OT ark of the covenant and Mary the new ark of the covenant. The easiest way to call out the similarities is through a table, please read the similarities in the table comparison. After reading the similarities if we still have a doubt that Mary is the new ark of the covenant, we can fast forward to Revelations Chapters 11:19 and 12:1. As a first-century Jew you have been waiting for the ark of the covenant to show up for almost 6 centuries, since the time of Jeremiah. So when John has the vision of the Revelations the big deal is that the ark that was missing is finally found in heaven.
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. Rev 11:19, 12:1
Let us honor our lady the new ark of the covenant that carries the fulfillment of all the old testament prefiguration - she carries Jesus. For non-Catholics, this reflection may be hard to read, would suggest just asking God for revelation with an open mind.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Old and New Covenants

![God's covenants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/oldandnewcovenants.jpg)

### Day 125 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 6:6-7
Uzzah died because the Ark of the Covenant was not given its due respect.
According to the Law, the Ark of the Covenant was to be touched and carried only by the ordained Levites, and Uzzah was not a Levite.  Also, David was transporting the Ark in a cart.
God may have given the Law to Moses centuries ago, but the Law was still the same.
God’s Law never changes from the time it is given until the end of time.

2 Samuel 6:14-15
David (the royal priest) represents Jesus, the Ark represents Mary, and Jerusalem represents God’s heavenly city.
David’s joy in bringing the Ark of the Covenant into the earthly Jerusalem prefigures the joy of Jesus in bringing Mary’s body into the heavenly Jerusalem.
Let us make sure that we don't receive a curse, like Michal did (2 Samuel 6:16 & 23), by failing to rejoice with Christ that His blessed mother is in the heavenly Jerusalem.

2 Samuel 7:14
*“I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me.”*
By these words God adopted David’s son Solomon long before Solomon was born (2 Samuel 12:24).

God first started the monarchy of His holy kingdom when He created Adam and gave him the authority to rule over the whole earth.  Thus, by default, his wife Eve would be the queen.  But when they brought sin into the world they lost their titles.

God later picked another couple, Abraham and Sarah, who would bring forth Isaac, the earthly son of the promise, and through Isaac would come the new Adam and the new Eve (Jesus and Mary), the king and queen mother of God’s holy Kingdom.

Many centuries later, Solomon, the son of the earthly King David and a descendant of Abraham’s son Isaac, became the son of God through the grace of adoption.  Some years later, when Solomon was crowned king, at his right hand was enthroned his mother, the queen.
This was a prototype of the Heavenly Davidic Kingdom of God.

In the new Covenant, Jesus, the son of God, would become the son of David, through the grace of adoption by Joseph, and at the right hand of Jesus, in Heaven, would be enthroned His mother, the queen and a descendant of David, according to the protocol of the Davidic kingdom.

What David established, Solomon continued and Jesus fulfilled.
Thus we recognize that establishing a king and a queen to start the monarchy of the new Covenant, was an essential part in God’s Covenant plan for His holy Heavenly Kingdom.

### David's Victories

[![David's Victories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day126.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JZa4niEoN00 "David's Victories")

### Day #126 The Lord gave David victory wherever he went

In the last chapter, we see King David was gifted a Palace by the neighboring King – who sent wood, carpenters, and workers to build a palace. Now David is concerned for the Lord and feels unworthy to live in the Palace while God rests in a tent. This seems like a very just and genuine concern for the Lord, so much so that Nathan the prophet says yes immediately. However, at night the Lord says no, but the Lord rewards David’s concern, the word of the Lord said
“I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth” 2 Sam 7:9
We see that David starts his wars against the neighboring kingdoms and places, the bible records the thousands of men who were conquered and those who were slain. King David’s army was winning every battle – because of the promise of the Lord to make his name great.
“The Lord gave victory to David wherever he went” 2 Sam 8:14
The promises of the Lord are true and genuine.
The promises of the Lord are sure, silver refined in a crucible, silver purified seven times. Ps 12:7
Let us remember that the word of the Lord will never return empty, it will always accomplish its purpose
so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. Is 55:11
So my friends let us not be discouraged but trust in the promise of the Lord for His word will never return empty but will accomplish all that God has in store for us.
David’s kingdom will enhance even more than he can imagine through his children and eventually by God himself – in Jesus Christ.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 126 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 10:13-14
*So Saul died for his unfaithfulness; he was unfaithful to the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord; moreover, he had consulted a medium, seeking guidance, and did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.*

King Saul lost the throne and his life because of the 4 sins which he had committed against the Lord:

1. For the massacre of priests in the city of Nob because they were protecting David;

A priest is God's anointed man who represents God on earth.  When we harm a priest, physically or verbally or in any other way, we offend God directly.

2. For sparing the Amalekite King Agag out of pity, instead of destroying him in obedience to God’s command (1 Samuel 15:17-21);

The Amalekite King Agag was a symbol of sin.  When we allow ourselves to live comfortably in sin, instead of destroying it completely, the sin will eventually be the cause of the destruction of our soul (Hell).

3. For not heeding Samuel’s request to wait for him for seven days to offer the sacrifice;

Offering to God the sacrifice prescribed by God, can be done only by God's anointed priests.  Anyone else trying to offer the prescribed sacrifice, even if they know the procedure, is trying to be like God without God, and that is an act of the devil.

4. For consulting a necromancer, instead of consulting the Lord.

According to the Mosaic Law, consulting people who were involved with occult practices, was forbidden (Deut. 18:10).
In the new Covenant, the Church still follows the same Law to this day.  Practicing divination, or using the services of people who are involved with occult practices, is a mortal sin.

In the old Covenant, Saul lost his physical life for committing these sins, but in the New Covenant, we will lose our spiritual/eternal life.

### Kindness for the House of Saul

[![Kindness for the House of Saul](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day127.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bga43-TseZg "Kindness for the House of Saul")

### Day #127 Remembering our friends

We know that David and Jonathan – Saul’s son were Best Friends Forever(BFF) – in fact, they would give their lives for each other. Now that David is in a position to pay back to Jonathan – he decides to find Jonathan's kin of Jonathan and ensure they are taken care of.
David asked, “Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 2 Sam 9:1
When they found Mephibosheth, Saul’s son who was lame in both feet. David summoned him and vowed to take good care of him.
“Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.” 2 Sam 7
We should be inspired to remember our friends of old, to not forget them when fortune favors us.
We should remember all our vows, our marriage vows, the promises we make at baptism to raise good children, the promises we make at confession, to avoid the near occasion of sin, and the promise we make to take care of our parents and families.
It is one thing to read the good dead’s that David did or to make promises, it’s another thing to actually keep them. That is why Jesus said the below.
“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. Mat 5:33-37
Jesus wants us to be people of action and not just words. It’s one thing to say “I love you” and another thing to be “Patient, kind, not envious, not proud, not self-seeking, not holding a record of wrongs.”
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Cor 13
Let our "Yes be Yes" and our "No be No". Let us people who keep our word, we should not be all words and no action.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 127 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Chronicles 12:32
*A group of men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do, joined David in Hebron to make him king.*

“Time” (in English) is either Kairos or Chronos (in Greek).
*Chronos time* refers to clock time or calendar time which humans follow, and which is mostly based on the movement of the sun or moon.
*Kairos time* is the right or perfect time when God chooses to intervene to accomplish His divine plan, and there is no fixed earthly date or time for God to intervene.
"Kairos" time can, however, become "Chronos" time after the event takes place and we either mark it on the calendar or remember it by the clock.

The group of men of Issachar understood “kairos” time because they had a close relationship with God (Galatians 5:25).  They were therefore given the knowledge and understanding that according to God’s plan David would rule Israel after Saul since David was already anointed for the same purpose.  Therefore, after the death of Saul, the group of men knew that it was the right time for them to leave the house of Saul and join the house of David.

There may have been “kairos” times in our lives too when God blessed us with miracles.
Our prayers are always heard by God on day 1 but His answers, whether positive or negative, will always come in His “kairos” time.  In the meanwhile, we must continue in our relationship with the Lord with patience.

### Mighty Men of Valor

[![Mighty Men of Valor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day128.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jc1hA8RWbco "Mighty Men of Valor")

### Day #128 How to handle "humiliation"

We read that King David wanted to be kind and loyal to the Ammonites because Nahash the ammonite king(dead now) was good to him.
David thought, “I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father.2 Sam 10:2
However, Nahash’s son Hanun was influenced by his commanders and humiliates David’s men.
So Hanun seized David’s envoys, shaved off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the buttocks, and sent them away. 2 Sam 10: 4
Now David’s men were greatly humiliated, but David handled the situation very well he went out to meet the men and asked them to stay at Jericho until their bead grew back.
David then send his Valant men who defeated the Ammoniates.
Now how do we handle humiliations? Let’s think of the last time we felt humiliated. We will mostly resort to one of two responses – fight or flight. If we chose to fight - we will try to humiliate the other person even worse or get angry and curse them. If we resort to flight - we will try to pass it off as though nothing happened or leave the place.
The best way to handle humiliation is to pray first, and try not to get humiliated because that is what they want.
Then warn the person sternly that their word or action is not acceptable, most people would back off at this point.
If they still persist then action is needed, everyone is under some authority. And the Lord is watching over you, He will fight for you, fight for the people who do the right thing.
A true event in St Mother Theresa’s life
One day Mother Teresa went to a local bakery to ask for bread for the starving children in the orphanage. The baker, outraged at people begging for bread from him, spat in her face and refused. Mother Teresa calmly took out her handkerchief, wiped the spit from her face and said to the baker, “Okay, that was for me. Now what about the bread for the orphans?” The baker, shamed by her response, gave her the bread she wanted.
Like St Mother Theresa let us turn to Jesus who was humiliated, spat upon, mocked and insulted, beaten and stripped naked. He was able to pray
“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”
It is not easy to stay calm and respond in a proper way, we are not Jesus or Mother Theresa. But we can be and God will help us in our weakness, that someday we will be able to respond in love. When people hurt us, or insult us those are all actual prayer requests, they are indirectly asking us “Can you pray for me?”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

2 Samuel 11:1-27
During the spring of the year, when Kings fought at the battlefields, David sent his officers to fight the Ammonites. Against his call of duty, David chose to stay back and while away his time at the palace.  David committed one grave mistake.  He sent the Ark of the Covenant to the battlefield. The Ark of the Covenant symbolized the presence of God.  David ended up committing adultery with Bathsheba because he then rested in the palace without the presence of God.

While idling away his time, David happened to see what he was not supposed to see. He could have looked the other way and moved on with his royal duties but he chose to continue looking.

If we happen to see something that we are not supposed to see, it is definitely not our mistake. However, if we decide to continue looking on with interest, and think with passion, we are surely putting ourselves on risky grounds.

David looked on and entered the dark and dubious world of sin. He entertained the evil spirit and allowed the spirit to control his mind.

When God is not with us it is very easy for the evil spirit to control our minds to do ungodly acts.

Later, to hide one sin David ended up committing another sin by killing Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba.

The closer we get to the object of our temptation, the more destructive it gets. We must flee from sin as from a snake.  Sin traps us into a vicious cycle.

When we allow ourselves to be influenced by one evil spirit, it will invite more evil spirits into our lives and thus we end up committing one sin after another to cover up the first sin if we don’t repent and try to get rid of the first one.

Failure of our spiritual lives begins with the absence of God in our lives and gradually affects our physical lives.

### Day #129 David’s Sloth leads to Adultery and Murder

We have been reading David’s life story, he was such a lovely person – a man after God’s heart, a just, kind, and wise King, he was a worshiper of God – a musician and one who loved the presence of the Lord. However, he has his weaknesses– we know that he was accumulating wives and concubines which the Lord forbid for the Kings of Israel.
In this sequence of events, the first sin David committed was the sin of sloth.
In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites, and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. 2 Sam 11:1
The kings in those days would go out to fight battles, however, David did not go – he sent his commanders instead. David should have been out there fighting battles for the Lord, however, the scripture says that he was sleeping on the couch in the afternoon and walking on the roof instead.
Laziness is creeping into him, with comfort and luxury, his will and spirit are weakened. He looks at a woman bathing and should have just looked away.
From the sin of lust of the eyes, it went to lust of the thoughts. He is thinking of her and eventually makes inquiries about her. He comes to know that it’s Uriah’s wife one of his trusted men. He should have backed off at least now, but his lust overtook him. He mis-uses his power as King and gets what he wants. Bathsheba becomes pregnant and now David is desperate. He tries to fix it by bringing Uriah back to his house to sleep with his wife, just doesn’t work for Uriah was a just man.
Eventually, He plots the death of Uriah and commits murder. David was a person to consult the Lord for everything, here he is falling head over heels into different sins.
What can we learn from this? We can learn that we are all broken earthen vessels, no one is perfect not even the great people of the Bible. But God makes us all whole again.
The other thing that we can learn is that we should stop sin when it's small and easy to overcome. If David has to resist the sin of sloth, he would have gone to battle and won victories, he would have prevented the other grave sins.
We should also try to avoid the near occasion of sins, we all know our weaknesses – we should avoid falling into bigger traps. For example: If you struggle with the sin of alcoholism – avoid going to a bar or going out with friends who love to drink,
if you are addicted to shopping – do not carry your credit card – use cash when you go shopping,
if you are addicted to pornography – use your devices only in public places/family rooms.
It is easy to say no to sin at the beginning – once you cross the hedge – you cannot stop yourself.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Nathan Condemns David

[![Nathan Condemns David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day130.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OqvYL60-Zio "Nathan Condemns David")

### Day 130 By Cynthia Dsilva

2 Samuel 12:1-15
David committed a sin by killing an innocent man (Uriah) to cover up his first sin of adultery (2 Samuel 11:1-25).

When prophet Nathan asked David to judge a case of a poor man being robbed by a rich man, David was quick to condemn the rich man for the injustice, while he kept his own sin covered.

We all commit sins due to the weakness of our damaged souls. Some of us are aware of our own weaknesses and we try to correct and improve ourselves, which is good. But some of us are blind to our own weaknesses while the weaknesses in others are so obvious to us that we condemn them.

Jesus said, “Let the one among you who is without sin, be the first one to throw a stone at her” (John 8:7).

God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17).

I came not to judge the world, but to save the world (John 12:47).

When Jesus does not condemn us, then who are we to condemn others?
When we see weaknesses or sins in others, let us be slow to condemn them.  Let it be an occasion for us to do a soul-searching, make a list of our own weaknesses and ask the Lord for pardon.

### Day #130 “3 C’s to Repentance – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart”

As we study Bible Characters we should always place ourselves in their shoes or identify with them, as we are all weak human beings. Apart from reading about their horrendous sins, we should also learn how they dealt with them. King David can teach us a great lesson on repentance, in fact, his Psalm, Psalm 51 has been the one most people use when they have committed a sin and are repenting. There is a big misconception about Christian repentance, because of the word used. The word repentance is defined as - sincere regret or remorse. However, repentance is not merely feeling sorry about what you did, it is being contrite and deciding to change your ways. The Greek word used in the gospels is
Metanoia– which means “a transformative change of heart”.
There are three steps to repentance.
CONVICTION
We see that King David commits major sins of Sloth, Adultery, and Murder and now breaks another one of the 10 commandments by bringing Bathsheba into his home, thinking that all is well. But the Lord was not happy about His servant David. He sends the prophet Nathan to tell David the story about the unjust owner of many sheep. David is cut to his heart, and he is convicted of his sin.
We need people in our lives to tell us when we are going off track, our spouse, parents, children, friends, society, priest, confessors, spiritual directors, events, retreats, sermons, word of God, talks, BIAY whatever it takes to convict us. We need the Holy Spirit who will lead us to all truth about ourselves, the Holy Spirit will convict us of our mistakes.
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Ps 51:3
CONTRITION
a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. Ps 51:17
This is the golden verse for repentance, when we are convicted of sin we should be cut to the heart. Feeling sorry for having offended our ever-loving God. We should not just focus on the wrong thing we did, but on the relationship that is broken due to sin. We are hurting our God and our neighbor when we sin, we are actually hurting the church as we are the body of the church. We cannot come to the Lord with pride or excuses for committing sin. just with a contrite and broken heart
Change of Heart
It just does not stop at sorrow for sin, it starts with a Change of heart. We have a God of second chances, He wants us to overcome sin and death. God will take our heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh; He will put a new and willing spirit in us. Change is the most important part of repentance. Whenever Jesus healed or forgave sin in His earthly ministry he always said – “Sin no more”
So what happens if we fall into sin again, don’t be discouraged just follow the process again CCC – Conviction, Contrition, and Change of Heart. If you keep falling into sin, just keep getting up.
Saint Faustina reminds us to never give up.
I perform works of mercy in every soul. The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. My mercy is confirmed in every work of My hands. He who trusts in My mercy will not perish, for all his affairs are Mine, and his enemies will be shattered at the base of My footstool (Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska, 723).
Just keep going to the font of mercy whenever you need to be washed of your sin. Eventually, the Lord will break you out of the sins you are unable to shake off. All the three C’s are present in the sacrament of confession, so frequent it as much as possible to rid yourself of sin.
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. Heb 4:15-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day #131 Lust does not satisfy

We read this horrendous event of a brother raping his stepsister, it’s truly very hard to read. Amnon is David’s son who has a very beautiful stepsister Tamar. Amnon was so obsessed with her that he made himself ill because of the sister. Amnon had a crafty friend who gave him this nasty idea to pretend to be sick just to be with her alone. Amnon forced himself on Tamar because she declined his advances and raped her as he was stronger than her. Something surprising happens after he rapes her, he hates her. He loved her earlier or though he did - he only stiring up lust in his own being.
Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!”2 Sam 13:15
One would assume that he would be happy and satisfied for he got what he wanted. But he only hated her after it, because she reminded him of his brokenness. This is the result when people lust over things and people, it never ends in fulfillment.
When people are looking to gratify their own desires, they are mistaken, they will never be satisfied. It’s like picking at a healing scab, it gets hurt again and bleeds causing another scab. This continues and the person never heals but the wound gets bigger and bigger. People who are in a relationship just for the pleasure will never be satisfied and we look for other options.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:18
Lust and sexual immorality is a sin that hurts the sinner as he/she is sinner against his/her own body. The Bible asks us to flee from this sin as we are hurting ourselves.
One tires to blame the media, society and the devil for the sins of lust, however it's mostly the desires within that person that is to be blamed.
But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death. James 1:14-15
If we let the sin of lust rein in us, we will eventually become spiritually blind and find it hard to come out of the trap, which leads to spiritual death.
Let us love instead of lust. Look for the benefit of the other person and their well-being. The sacrament of marriage celebrates the union of the husband and wife, who are open to life and open to God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### David And Absalom

[![David And Absalom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day132.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZFb0B0AZ_Js "David And Absalom")

### Day #132 Holding a grudge - Michael Eltham

We are still getting over the misery that Tamar went through, her stepbrother Amnon raped her and threw her away. Her whole life was ruined she could not get married after that as in the Jewish custom then, only virgins get married. Her brother Absalom takes her into his house and she lives her life as a desolate woman. What a tragedy, a life wasted due to Amnon’s lust. If it wasn't for Amnon, Tamar would have gotten married and had children and raised them, she is deprived of the family life. This caused a lot of hate in Absalom’s heart, and he worked up a plan to avenge His sister’s rape. He invites the sons of David for an event at his house and had Amnon killed.
Absalom flees and is in hiding. Now Joab tries to patch things up by tricking David to listen to a wise woman’s fake story(Joab tried to use the format Nathan used to convict David of his sin – by telling a similar story) we can read the story, and eventually, David asks Absalom to come back to the city. However, David does not let him come into his presence for two full years. Absalom is getting frustrated as the king asked him to come back but does not let him come into his presence. The Kind does not talk to Absalom directly, he is letting him stay in the city but does not accept him back as a son. David and Absalom are just tolerating each other here, there is no repentance or forgiveness, and the love is not restored.
This is the state of many families today, there is a lot of hate, misunderstanding, and grudges between family members – between parents and children, between siblings, between cousins, between in-laws. Most people are taking the positions that David and Absalom took – no repentance or forgiveness – we are just tolerating each other without actually sorting out the problem, without genuine repentance or forgiveness. There is bitterness in the air, one person not talking to the other, not seeing eye to eye, hurtful words and gestures.
The model we have in David and Absalom is not the one we should be following. We should follow the model of the prodigal son and the Father. The Father in the parable was looking out for his son every day, waiting for him to come back, David was just grieving his other son's death and not even concerned about Absalom. Absalom was acting like the prodigal son, the prodigal son had an attitude of “At least I will be a servant at my father's house” - Absalom was burning down fields in frustration.
Let us model our repentance and forgiveness on the parable of the prodigal son. Let us pray for our families and especially for the strained relationships. It is easier said than done, but let us not feel discouraged for “when we are weak He is strong.”
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day #133 Falling to correct our kids can make them rebellious

As we try to wrap our heads around the mess in David’s family, Amnon rapes his stepsister Tamar and her brother Absalom avenging it by killing Amnon (his stepbrother). One can’t help but call out the lack of action on David’s part. David being their father should have stepped in and handled the situation better, he should have asked the Lord for direction on what needed to be done. David was great when it came to his ruling as King but he let his personal life slip, he failed to be a good father.
The first mistake he made was to have so many wives and children even though God forbid it for the Kings of Israel. The second mistake was his lack of prudent about sending Tamar to Amnon’s house. The third mistake was In-action toward Amnon’s sin – he failed to protect his daughter and failed to take her in to his house after Amnon sent her off. Fourth he failed to make peace with Absalom and failed to give him back his position as son and did not assign him any duty in the kingdom.
This caused Absalom, who was very good-looking and smart, clever, and a man with an initiative to gain popularity. Eventually, due to King David’s inaction – he now must flee from his own son Absalom. David has let down his people and let down the Lord in failing to be a good father.
Let us learn from this and be good parents to our children, parents who love, forgive, and discipline them when they go off track. If we fail to act, we are supporting their sin. They will grow in their sin and bad habits and eventually become a beast someday. They will be a force that neighed we or society cannot content with, we will have to flee as well.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Devastating Effects of Sin

[![Devastating Effects of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/May/jpgs/Day134.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SWpv2XiqxR4 "Devastating Effects of Sin")

### Day #134 We humans are prone to sin - concupiscence

Earlier Absalom was so zealous to avenge his sister’s rape, now commits rape. He gets advice from Ahithophel (David’s previous adviser and friend) who suggests a shameful act to show dominance over David. Absalom sleeps with David’s concubines in the sight of all of Israel. The one who avenged rape earlier now commits the same sin, shamelessly in public.
David earlier was just and did not lay hands on King Saul even though Saul was envious of him and tried to kill him. This same David is envious of Uriah’s wife Bathsheba and causes the murder of Uriah.
What becomes clear is that we humans can be good one day and terribly bad another day. We are prone to sin and are not strong, the flesh is weak.
We have to be careful with ourselves, given the opportunity or on a bad day, each of us can be terrible. According to the below excerpt from the CCC we all have an inclination to sin, even though the original sin is washed away in Baptism we are very capable and inclined to sin. The term is “concupiscence” - an inclination to evil.

CCC 405 Although it is proper to each individual,295 original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendants. It is a deprivation of original holiness and justice, but human nature has not been totally corrupted: it is wounded in the natural powers proper to it, subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin - an inclination to evil that is called "concupiscence". Baptism, by imparting the life of Christ's grace, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God, but the consequences for nature, weakened and inclined to evil, persist in man and summon him to spiritual battle.
Our enemy the devil is always on the prowl, trying to devour us. Let us never leave the side of Jesus, lest we fall into the trap that is set for us.
Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walketh about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 1 Pet 5:8
May the Angels of the Lord protect and guard our hearts against every evil, harm, and danger.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
