### Day 38 ‚ÄúRelationship and Rules‚Äù - Michael Eltham

No relationship will flourish without rules. There is no sport without rules, no school without school rules, imagine driving on a road without any traffic rules, would you put your money in a bank with no rules and anyone could withdraw your money. Rules are for the common good of all.

When you buy any product, it will always come with a manual to use the product. No one will put stainless steel containers in a microwave or fill water in a car gas tank. Without knowing we are following rules in the world, what if you decide to not believe in the law of gravity and decide to walk off a skyscraper. Foolishness. :)

God gave us commandments not to burden us or to make us miserable. But to give us a guideline to live the good life. Just imagine if everyone followed the commandments, if everyone had a right relationship with God, honored their parents, did not steal, kill, or commit adultery. It would have been heaven on earth. Being human we tend to dabble with sin, we look for momentary satisfaction and a shortcut (For example: eating the forbidden fruit to become like God)

Sin causes shame, like Adam and Eve we want to hide from God. We lose our right relationship with God which leaves us empty. We try to fill this emptiness with more temporary satisfaction by committing more sin. We will never rest until we rest in God.

Let us rise up and go to the Father who is waiting for us. Try again to follow His commandments so that it will be good with us and we are in the right state with God, we will walk with Him fearlessly in the Garden in the cool of the evening.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
