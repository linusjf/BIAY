### Obligations to God

[![Obligations to God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day059.jpg)](https://youtu.be/5e8Tw2TL6CY "Obligations to God")

### Day 59 ‚ÄúNo exemption for not keeping the Passover/Eucharist‚Äù

We see the strict instruction on how every Israelite was required to keep the Passover. Even if the person was unclean or traveling, there is no excuse. This is a mandatory command of the Lord because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthat‚Äù important. If anyone who is able to keep the Passover chooses not to, he/she will be cut off from the flock. The Passover is the pre-figuration of the Mass. Jesus instituted the Eucharist as the new Passover, we will get to that when we read the New Testament.

But for now, let us learn how important keeping the Passover or attending Mass is, we will be cut off from the flock if we don‚Äôt go to Mass as prescribed by the church.

The Catholic Church makes it very clear ‚ÄúSunday is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation.‚Äù (cf. Canon 1246.1) There are no excuses ‚Äì no holidays or sports qualify ‚Äì we need to go to Mass at least on Sunday or Saturday eve. There are a few exceptions like ‚Äì if you are sick or caring for someone who is sick or if you are elderly or too young.

The other days of obligation (as per the USCCB):

January 1, the solemnity of Mary, Mother of God
Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter, the solemnity of the Ascension
August 15, the solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
November 1, the solemnity of All Saints
December 8, the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception
December 25, the solemnity of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

The word obligation can be misunderstood in two ways,

1. can portray the Eucharist as unappealing, as though the people are forced to go to it

2. as a minimum duty as though they will be saved and are going to heaven for sure

Both those views need to be changed, the Eucharist is the highest form of worship and heaven joins earth ‚Äì if it feels dull and mundane ‚Äì it means we are unaware/under-educated on the true presence of Jesus. As we read through the BIAY ‚Äì it will be slowly unveiled.

One is not saved just by showing up for Mass, sorry that‚Äôs the truth. We need to live the Eucharist out in our lives, the Eucharist we eat should transform us to another Christ. In fact, if we receive communion unworthily, we are sinning and eating and drinking judgment upon ourselves.

27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be answerable for the body and blood of the Lord. 28 Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29 For all who eat and drink without discerning the body, eat and drink judgment against themselves. 30 For this reason many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. 31  1 Cor 17-31

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
