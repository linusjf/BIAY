### Day 44: “Priests' clothes during Worship aren’t Jeans and T-shirt” - Michael Eltham ###

The detailed description of the vestments in today's reading can get to you. Hope this pictures, I found on the internet will help.

In our modern day and age we see fashion and style becoming increasingly immodest. This has crept into the church, we see a few Church goers, may be even some “Choir members” or lectors not wear appropriate attire. We also see that in some non-Catholic demonization, there is an over emphasis on how the Stage looks – lights -sound, rock start pastors, pastors preaching in Jeans/shorts/t-shirts or overly fancy suits. All that is okay for a Christian concert or a social event. It’s important to give our best to God, however we need to follow His instructions when it comes to true Worship. When we attend Mass, we are celebrating the grand wedding feast of the Lamb – we are His bride and He is our bridegroom. We need to be modest and dressed well to honor Him.

The Priest is persona Christi – represents Christ. The Vestments – are meant to obscure the individuality of the priest and to draw attention to Christ. He is no longer black, white or brown or young, old, weak, strong -he loses his identity – Like John the Baptist said “He must increase and I Must decrease”

The priest like in the OT had 12 stones on his breastplate to represent the 12 tribes of Israel. He carried God’s people in His heart when we offered the sacrifice. Even our priest carry the people in their heart when they offer the sacrifice of the Mass. Each part of the Bishop's vestment means something worth learning about.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
