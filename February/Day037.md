### Day 37: “Water from the Rock - Jesus” - Michael Eltham

Before we get into the water from the rock, there is a moving image of the power of intercessory prayer. We see when Moses held up his hands the Israelites prevailed and when he put his hand down the Amaleks prevailed. When his hands grew weary Arron and Hur helped lift them up.

The life lesson to learn here is – when we encounter difficult situations and big problems(war) we need to lift up our arms in prayer (Be still for the Lord is fighting for us – we ought to keep praying and stand our ground) and when we get weary of praying we need our family, friends and community to support us in prayer.

“Israelites the fault finders” sounds a little harsh when we call them out like this, but aren’t we being fault finders when we call out their fault. Let’s put ourselves in their shoes and we would possibly do the same if we were without water. We would probably say “Isn’t God with us?”

The Lord command Moses to strike the rock with his rod and water flowed out. This quenched their thirst.

Jesus the new Moses is the rock Himself, the rock of ages, the stone that the builders rejected.

When the soldiers pierced His side, blood and water poured out. The living water – the Holy Spirit – the water that Jesus spoke about at the well to the Samaritan women.

“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” Jh 4:13

Jesus fulfils this promise on Pentecost, He send the Holy Spirit the Living waters to become within us a spring of water gushing  up to eternal life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
