### Day 51 ‚ÄúGetting worship of God right‚Äù "Votive offerings" ###

Some would argue that God is Omnipresent, and we can worship Him anywhere, there is no need for a structure. Yes, we can worship God anywhere, there is no harm in that. But if we have been paying close attention, we see detailed instructions about the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, the screens, the lampstand, and most important the consecration of the place to be dedicated for the worship of the most High God.
Of course, the Lord is present when you read your bible at home, He is present when you sing praise songs while driving, He is present in your family prayer and person prayer. However, He calls us to go to Church, the place dedicated to His worship, community worship. We see in the reading how the cloud of smoke engulfed the tabernacle, the presence of the Lord was so strong that the Levites could not even go in. We need to be sensitive to the presence of God when we go to church, bow down and adore Him in the tabernacle. And as we will read later ‚Äì how Jesus will teach us "how to worship", and we will read how the apostles were dedicated to the breaking of bread and if we like we can go deeper and learn how the early Christians and the church fathers worshiped God (not part of the Bible, but can be found in early historic records and writings) it‚Äôs amazing how the Eucharist is the fulfillment of the earlier sacrifices and the one method of worship that was instituted by Jesus and practice and preserved through the generations in its original state. We will learn more as we read through the BIAY. But for now, let us remember that we need to Get worship right, not how we want to, but how God prescribes it.
Votive Offering ‚Äì Many people were so moved by the Lord that they wanted to give more than what is asked. That‚Äôs why we see the value of work(wages) of different people men, women of diff ages had a different Shekel value. It was for those who could not offer sacrifice because there were not Levites, yet wanted to offer more than what was asked of them. Hence they gave their value of wages in the votive offering.
We need to ask ourselves ‚Äì what is my votive offering. Am I just doing the minimum required or am I moved by the Lord to do more than I am asked?
How about going beyond the Sunday obligation and going to church on a few weekdays.
If we have an attitude of ‚ÄúIf I wake up I‚Äôll go‚Äù we need to change it and be more precise like the Levites, measure out what we can do and what we want to do for the Lord, dedicated it to the Lord and He will make sure all hurdles are removed for us to do what we intend to do.
Congratulations on completing Exodus and Leviticus!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
