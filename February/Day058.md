### Day 58: ‚ÄúDo not have strong ties with the world‚Äù -Michael Eltham

As we journeyed with the Israelites we noticed that the nations that the Lord handed over to the Israelites were much stronger and greater than the Israelites. The Lord with a ‚ÄúMighty hand and outstretched arm‚Äù won every battle for the Israelites.

We see that the Lord commanded the Israelites through Moses not to have mercy on the lands they conquered, to break all the altars of strange gods, not to intermarry with the pagans or make covenants with the other nations. The Lord commanded that they take no gold or silver from those nations.

One possible reason could be that the Lord knows their hearts and their past. They were a people who were born into slavery in Egypt and who possibly practiced local rituals and customs of the Egyptians. They were a people who previously made an idol of gold ‚Äì Baal. The Lord is being very clear here and telling them that they are ‚ÄúA Chosen people, a people set apart‚Äù Not because of what they did but because of God‚Äôs picking, because of the covenant God made with their ancestors(Abraham, Isaac, Jacob). God wanted to preserve them and keep them holy, set them apart for the Lord. Because God will eventually bring Salivation to the whole world through them ‚Äì Jesus would be from the Israelites. Jesus will open salvation to the entire humanity.

We can take a lesson from their journey; we can try not to have strong ties to the world and worldly people.

Jesus calls us to this, he sends us into the world to be a light to the world, we are the salt to the world. Let us be in the world but not of the world.

Jesus prayed for us in John 17:14-18

‚ÄúI have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. 15 I am not asking you to take them out of the world, but I ask you to protect them from the evil one.\[e\] 16 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world. 17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.‚Äù

Let us not be worldly people but a people set apart, a chosen generation for the Lord. Let us not defile ourselves with the things of the world. Let us not overly focus on this life but on the next.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
