### Day 36: ‚ÄúMurmuring for Manna to Murmuring about the True presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.‚Äù - Michael Eltham

A few weeks after the great Miracle of the Red Sea parting, the Israelites start their murmuring.

They look back at the days of their slavery and say it would have been better for us to have died in the land of Egypt, at least we had enough to eat. God rains Manna from heaven, the bread that came down from heaven. This bread that they ate sustained them for the journey to the promised land.

This was just a prefiguration of what we have today in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the bread of life, the bread that came down from Heaven. Jesus was born in Bethlehem - which means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù.

Jesus offers us His body in the Eucharist, our daily Manna. The food that will sustain us on our journey to the promised land ‚Äì Heaven.

Jesus referred to this incident in John 6

‚ÄúI am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.‚Äù

Most people started ‚Äúmurmuring‚Äù after this teaching ‚Äì about eating his flesh. They said this teaching was too difficult and they stopped following Jesus. If the bread he offered was just symbolic and not real flesh, they would have not left, Jesus meant His flesh. We will deep dive into this when we get to John.

Are we murmuring about the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist? The Eucharist is truly Jesus‚Äô Body and Blood, the food that will sustain us on our journey to Heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 36 Simitra

Exodus 16:17-18, "And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat".

Irrespective of the quantity they collected, those who collected  much did not have left over and those who collected less were not in lack.

This is so profound. If only we can look at this and know that no matter how much we accumulate it will never be sufficient for our greed however those who are in poverty are  living their lives relying on God to give them their fill each day and so are filled.

So let us live to worship God. We are given six days to work and keep one day -the Sabbath Holy as it is the day that we are to praise and worship God for his goodness. One day to praise and thank God, so that we remember that we have His grace with us on the six days that we work.

### Day 36 Anonymous

God is training them. Trying to teach His people who He is and the degree to which they can trust Him.  He is faithful.   We have to be obedient to Him, His commandments.   He told the people of Israel not to keep food He gave them for the next day.  Yet some disobeyed and kept, but next day it was spoilt.  God shows how truthful He is.  But when God commanded them to gather on the sixth day for 2 days as it was Sabbath, Holy to The Lord, the food never spoilt.  Such is the Power of God Almighty.  What He says He does.
All Glory to HIM!
