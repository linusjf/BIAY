### Day 46: “Holy Oil, Holy water, Holy stuff, Sacramentals” ###

It’s fascinating to see how many of the practices in the catholic church stem from OT instructions from the Lord. The sabbath law, the consecrating of cups, temples, altars, and priests.

We see that priests were anointed with oil. One thing to call out is there is no intrinsic power in the oil or the oil on its own has no power - it’s the method God prescribes.

Just as we dedicate different bowls for different purposes, the bowls used to feed the dogs won’t be used to feed the kids.

When something is blessed – all we do is mark it for special use, for a supernatural purpose.

That’s why the priests are anointed and set apart to do God’s work.

Even oils, water, salt, medals, prayer cloths, bibles, pictures, and statues are used, once blessed are called “sacramentals” They are used for sacramental purposes and for personal prayer use.

The blessed items are holy and will help remind us to pray and even ward off evil. It can be used when praying prayers of healing or deliverance. Many miracles have taken place with the use of sacramentals.

One of the Biblical references for sacramentals can be seen in acts, where handkerchiefs from Paul healed sick people.

Acts 29: 11, 12 “God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.”

Go on Sprinkle some Holy water 😃

Joke: How do you make holy water?

Boil the hell out of it. 😂

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
