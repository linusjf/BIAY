### Day 43: “The Tabernacle, His presence” - Michael Eltham. ###

We could get lost in the details as we read today's reading about the “blueprint” of the Tabernacle. Whenever I see a lot of detail documented the stance I take is that the thing is of great importance. The more the details the greater the importance. “If we have no plan we are planning to fail” A few things that struck home when I was hearing the readings was the close similarity of the worship in the Catholic Church thousands of years later. The concept of the bread of the presence – where bread is always present with a lampstand near it, every catholic church has one and this makes the church holy.

The Old Testament bread was just bread offered up to the Lord, but our NT bread is the consecrated body of Jesus, the true flesh of Jesus. (John 6) This is not just biblical but also proven by countless Eucharistic Miracles that have taken place down the centuries. Many of the Miracles have been scientifically evaluated and found to be supernatural – Like when the bleeding host was evaluated – it turned out to be the heart tissue of a middle-aged man in distress. So many other similarities like the Holy of Holies – the general area and the altar of the church. The table of offering the cherubim and the mercy seat etc. One thing to call out is Catholics do not worship any of the images or statues – they are just visuals for us to worship God, we do worship Jesus who is present in the Tabernacle and that’s why we bow down.

And let us not forget that the mercy seat was built on top of the ark of the covenant – just to remind us that God’s mercy is above the law. He loves us first and has mercy towards us, the law is something we need to follow to be better lovers of God and Neighbour. But His Mercy exceeds the law. We are saved by His Mercy and not by following the law.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏
