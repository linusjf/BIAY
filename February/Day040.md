### Day 40: ‚ÄúOnly Mortal sin makes us unworthy of receiving communion, not just bodily discharge‚Äù - Michael Eltham ###

We are invited to the great banquet, the lamb‚Äôs supper ‚Äì we receive Jesus‚Äô body and blood. To respond to this invitation, we must prepare ourselves for so great and so holy a moment. 

St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself."218 Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion. CC 1385

The reason I bring it up is for us not to get too worried about instructions in Leviticus about becoming unclean from bodily discharge. Remember these instructions are Baby steps that will evolve into solid teaching by the time Jesus comes.

The only thing that makes us unworthy of receiving communion is Mortal sin. If the bodily discharge is due to a mortal sin then you are unworthy due to the mortal sin, not the bodily discharge alone.

‚ÄúBut what comes out of the man, that is what defiles him.
 From within the man, from his heart,
 come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,
 adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
 licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.
 All these evils come from within and they defile.‚ÄùMk 7:21-23

Jesus is making it very clear that we should not pay too much attention to outward things but focus on the heart, for from the heart comes sin and it is sin that defiles us.

Congratulations on making it to day 40, the number 40 means a long time in the bible. Kudos to us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè
