### Day 49: ‚ÄúA willing and cheerful giver‚Äù

As we read the blueprint that God gives the Israelites, the details are so many. If I was given these instructions, I would say let‚Äôs just make a square box for the tablets and get done with it. I would think why all this fuss about the hooks, the poles, the mercy seat, the curtains, the jewelry, the altars, the utensils, the lamps.
But the Israelites responded with great willingness, they came everyone whose heart stirred him, everyone whose spirit moved him, men and women, with different skills weaving, constructing, etc. The people started looking for stuff in their houses, they brought jewelry, fine cloth, anything of value, they brought stuff every day.
‚ÄúThe people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the Lord has commanded us to do. So the people were restrained from bringing; for the stuff they had was sufficient to all the work and more‚Äù Ex 35:5,7
There is something for us to learn from the Israelites, we need to cultivate this attitude towards God‚Äôs work. We should go out of our way to give towards the Gospel, give of our time, our talent, and our resources. We should be willing and our hearts should be stirring to do God‚Äôs work and to love our neighbor.
‚ÄúGod loves a cheerful giver.‚Äù 2 Cor 9:7
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Day 49 Anonymous

There's no greater act that any human can do than the Act of Worship!
Open our hearts to trust in You, to love You, Lord.
Jubilee Year - The year of restoration.  In this year every Israelite slave would be restored to freedom,
because they are not meant to be slaves.  "I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT."
Thank You Lord, for Your mercies n not letting us be slaves forever!
