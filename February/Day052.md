### Day 52 “Names, names, names – God was serious when he said I have called you by name” - Michael Eltham

As we hear the names and the numbers we tend to tune out, it’s totally normal for us. Our capacity as human beings is limited, we can only care for ourselves, our family, and our friends.
However the Lord cares for everyone, he loves each one of us so intimately that
“He knows when we sit down and when we raise up, when we go out and when we come in. Even before a word is on our lips He already knows it.” Ps 139.
“Even your very hair is numbered: – Mat 10
He chose us
“You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you” John 15
“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” Jer 1:5
This knowledge is too much for us to understand, that our creator can love each one in such a personal way. We cannot even imagine how the Lord can love billions and billions and zillions of people across centuries. That he can care about every little thing about each person that ever existed. Even the most complex network of computer servers cannot come close to the knowledge of God. We are truly blessed to be God's chosen children.
My favorite part of today’s psalm - 84:
Better is one day in your courts
than a thousand elsewhere;
I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
I have never come out of prayer sad or hopeless. Every time we pray – we encounter God and no one leaves the presence of God sad and hopeless.
“Prayer is the best weapon we possess. It is the key that opens the heart of God.”
St Padre Pio.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
