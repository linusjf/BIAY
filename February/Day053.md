### Day 53 “Following the guidance of the Lord” - Michael  Eltham ###

We see how the Lord gives them detailed instruction on how to deal with the different cities/tribes that they come across. He said that he should not fight some people (Esau’s descendants) but buy food and water from them, and then fight with those who do not let them pass. God has a plan for them, he knows the future and will guide them according to His path.

In the same way, the Lord has plans for us.

Jer 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”

We need to lean on the Lord in prayer to hear His heart and to learn what He wants of us.

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.” Prov 3:5-6

We can find God’s heart as we read His word. His word will guide us on the right path.

“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” Ps 119:105

And always remember just as the tribe of Judah always marched first. Our praise should also go up first. Judah means praise.

May this Psalm be our song, may praise always be on our lips.

Ps 34: “I will bless the Lord at all times;
  his praise shall continually be in my mouth.”

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
