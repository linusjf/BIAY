### Day 41: “Atonement for sins – Confession & Eucharist”

Instructions given for atonement of sins are so detailed and clear, two lambs were needed – one for the priests and one for the people, placing the sins on the lamb and sacrificing one and sending the other one out to the wilderness to die.

Jesus is the spotless lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. He does not need two lambs as He was the priest himself, a priest in the order of Melchizedek, He had no sins and only had to carry the sins of the people.

“ Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. “ Heb 7:27

We need not offer lambs, goats, or bulls anymore as Jesus paid for our sins once and for all. However, we are invited to celebrate the Lamb's supper everyday “Do this in memory of me”.

We are invited to the “Atonement of sins” and the sacrifice literally every day at Mass and mandatory once a week on Sunday.

We need to prepare for Mass by checking our hearts for any unconfessed sins.

We need to pray with the Psalmist and examine our conscience

Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts. See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Ps 139:23-24

If our sins are Venial then a Confession is not Mandatory as the truly repented "Venial" sins are forgiven at Mass, but if it’s a Mortal sin we need to make a confession to be made worthy to receive communion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
