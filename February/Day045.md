### Day 45: “Holy Priests and celibacy” ###

When major clergy scandals come up, we can very easily blame the priests and the bishops. However, we need to remember that priests come from families and from the community. There is a lot of sin and corruption in this world that has influenced everyone laity and priests alike. We need to pray and support our brother priests to lead a holy life. And we need to also bring to justice those who have violated the innocence of others.

The catholic priests are called to imitate Jesus at a higher level, hence are also called to celibacy.

Below is an excerpt from “Catholic Answers ”

In examining the issue of celibacy, we should first address its historical development in the life of the Church and then its spiritual basis and relevance for today’s clergy.

Our Lord presented celibacy as a legitimate lifestyle not only by His very life since He never married but also in His teaching. When our Lord emphasized that marriage was a covenant between husband and wife and thereby prohibited divorce and re-marriage (cf. Matthew 19:3-12), He concluded, “Some men are incapable of sexual activity from birth; some have been deliberately made so; and some there are who have freely renounced sex for the sake of God’s reign.” Traditionally, our Church– as evidenced in the Catechism (#1579)– points to this “free renunciation of sex for the sake of God’s reign” as a basis for celibacy.

Nevertheless, in the early Church, clerical celibacy was not mandated. St. Paul in his first letter to St. Timothy wrote, “A bishop must be irreproachable, married only once, of even temper, self-controlled, modest, and hospitable” (3:2) and “Deacons may be married but once and must be good managers of their children and their households” (3:12). However, one should not erroneously construe this teaching to mean that a bishop, priest, or deacon had to be married; St. Paul admitted that he himself was not married (I Corinthians 7:8).
