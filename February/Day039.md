### Day 39 ‚ÄúGod delivered Israelites from slavery, now He will slowly remove slavery from their hearts‚Äù  - Michael Eltham ###

Like Fr Mike explained so beautifully, God must deal gently with us broken human beings. If we take the reading out of context, we can tend to say that God likes slavery and hence made rules for the slaves. If God does not stoop down to our level, we will not be able to bare God, just like when God spoke to his people on mount Sanai a few chapters ago it was like thunder and the people requested Moses that God not speak to them, rather Moses be the listener.

A nocturnal creature like a rodent ‚Äì would flee to hide when there is a bright light turned ON. In the same way, if God reveals Himself to us directly, we will die of awe. We will be blinded like Saul(St Paul) we will be consumed by His fire of Love. God is dealing gently with the Israelites who were slaves for generations (400 years), slavery is a way of life for them. It‚Äôs just like bringing an abused pet home, we need to first let the pet know that we are not going to hurt it. We need to give it space, and offer it some calm, some care, although we want to go and hug it and tell it that we mean no harm, the pet is not in a state to understand care and love ‚Äì it will bite us if we approach it with too much of enthusiasm. It took God little time to get the Israelites out of slavery (Egypt) but will take many years to get slavery (Egypt) out of their hearts. Let us journey with them, as the Lord journeys with us to lead us slowly and gently to wholeness as He leads the Israelites to the promised land both physically and mentally.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
