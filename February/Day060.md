### Day 60: “Stubborn people – Intercesssory prayer - 40 days 40 nights X TWO ” ###

As we read through the journey of the Israelites, we see how the Lord was guiding them so closely. The Lord tells them when to move when to stop – they were led by the fire of smoke.

As we read multiple times they start with the tribe of Judah - which means praise (praise should always be the first thing we do). Even though God is leading them and fighting for them - giving them nations much stronger.

The people rebel, they are stubborn, stiff-necked people – constantly complaining – creating molten images and defiling the Lord.

We see how Moses would go up the mountain – fast for 40 days and night – interceding and praying for the people. He does this not once but twice – once when he received the tablets written by the finger of God – he came down and found that the people have made a molten image and started worshiping it. The mounting was fiery and fuming with God’s anger – he went up again and prayed for 40 days and 40 nights - eventually, the Lord accepted the prayer of Moses and spared the people. We are called to pray for the stubborn people in this world. We need to pray for our political leaders, rebel people, greedy authorities, those who have deafened their ears to the Lord.

Let us make a list of stubborn people in our lives – from our family, friends, and society. Let us offer them up to the Lord this Lent, as we pray 40 days and 40 nights. Let us ask God to give them strength – to see their mistakes and repent.

Let us pray for ourselves – for the stubborn bad habits we are unable to kick. Our intercessory pray will make big difference. Pray one whole lent if it does not bring results – pray another 40 days and 40 nights. We will not rest our case until the Lord hears us – rather until the people, we are praying for change. The Lord is always willing, but the flesh is weak.

Like St Monica who prayed for her whole life for St Augustine – we will not give up. We will persevere in prayer and intercession. For we may be praying for the next saint in the church.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
