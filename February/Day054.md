### Day 54: “Don’t take your faith for granted, work out your salvation”

One statement that Fr Mike made really stood out.  “All priests have to be Levites, but not all Levites are priests.”

We see that two Levite priests offer unholy fire and die. We also see Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land.

“We don’t inherit heaven just because we are baptized/Christians/Priests ”

In our own faith life, one tends to focus only on the promises that the Lord makes, rely only on God’s mercy, and do nothing. This is the wrong formula.

The correct formula is to strive hard to be holy and get rid of sin from our lives, we will not succeed if we only go with “will power”, we need to be led by the Holy Spirit's power (Holy Spirit is our helper) in partnership with the Holy Spirit we can strive to be holy, as holy as we can be. However, after trying really hard all our lives, we need to rely not on our own righteousness but rely fully on Jesus saving Mercy and grace.

We as Christians just cannot continue to live in sin and assume everything is okay, that we will be saved.

“What then are we to say? Should we continue in sin in order that grace may abound? 2 By no means! How can we who died to sin go on living in it? 3 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” Rom 6:15

We need to work out our salvation in partnership with God.

“ work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 13 for it is God who is at work in you, enabling you both to will and to work for his good pleasure. “ 2 Phil 12

St Paul sets a good example – he tried really hard all his live and was able to say

“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” 2 Tim 4:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
