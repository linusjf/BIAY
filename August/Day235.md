### BIAY Day 235 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 15:10
*I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.*

In ancient Israel most of the fights took place because of borrowing and lending, and resulted in people cursing each other.  But Jeremiah was distressed because he was being cursed even without getting involved in borrowing or lending.
Yet he did not retaliate.  He followed the Word of God and sought God’s help.
God wanted him to suffer for the salvation of others.

Sometimes God may allow similar things to happen to us too.  We may wonder why we are victims of cruelty or evil or injustice, etc. when we have neither done anything wrong nor interfered with anyone’s life.

In a Covenant relation, it is always the innocent who suffer for the sins of the guilty because God’s justice for the unrighteous is satisfied by borrowing goodness from the righteous.  That is why God accepts the Blood of Jesus offered in atonement for our sins.

Therefore, if we are in a similar situation as Jeremiah then we must suffer with patience and offer our sufferings to Christ as penance for the sins of our offenders (Colossians 1:24), while we also pray for them.

Ezekiel 44:2-3
*The LORD said to me, “This gate must remain shut; it must not be opened, and no one should come through it. Because the LORD, the God of Israel, came through it, it must remain shut.”*

When the presence of the Lord passed through the gate of the temple, that gate had to be shut and no one could ever enter or exit it again.
This was a symbol of the perpetual virginity of Mary.

It was God’s Will that Mary’s womb should be a perpetual virgin womb, a unique vessel specially reserved only for His Son, because the Lord had passed through it.  But Mary remained a perpetual virgin, not because she was forced by anyone but because God gave her the grace to accept His Will, and she always co-operated with God’s grace by putting God’s Will first in her life.

Joseph also, being a righteous man himself (Matthew 1:19), always co-operated with God’s grace by putting God’s Will first in his life.  And Joseph led a virginal life knowing that Mary was chosen by God to be the spouse of the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35).

In the early Church, this type of marriage was known as “Josephite marriage.”

God gives each one of us too the grace to accept His Will but it always depends on whose will is our priority, God’s Will or our will.

*Only the prince may sit in it to eat a meal in the presence of the LORD; he must enter through the vestibule of the gate and leave the same way.*

The prince was a type of Christ.  Christ alone passed through the womb of Mary.
