Jeremiah 8:18-22
Gilead was known for its world famous herbal treatments.
God had been silent when the people were suffering and it didn't look like any help was going to come from Heaven.  The only option left was for the prophet to weep continuously for his people because although they were suffering due to the calamity he was more hurt because of their spiritual blindness (v. 19-20).  They ignored or took for granted all the blessings and miracles which God had done in their lives.
Jeremiah cried for his people just as Jesus cried for His people because His people refused to follow Him (Luke 19:41).

Ezekiel 37:1-6
The dry bones will be the in-gathering of the Jews without the Holy Spirit because of their unbelief.  The Holy Spirit will breathe divine life into them only when they will believe in Christ and accept to be baptized.

The Valley of dry bones – hope in the Lord
The best way to read this is to place yourself in the field of dry bones. Let us try to prayerfully read this scripture – try to imagine that you are present in the valley.
The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. 2 He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. 3 He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”
I said, “Sovereign Lord, you alone know.”
4 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! 5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. 6 I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 8 I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them.
9 Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’” 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army.Eze 37:1-10
This vision of Ezekiel would have been so hard to preach because Israel was in a state of despair, they had no hope. They were in exile in a place of no return. They would have found the prophecy to hard to believe.
We could sometimes be in a situation where there seems to be no hope, death is all around us and we feel that there is no redemption, there is no return. This could be the state of someone we love, a spouse/parent/child/friend – we know for a fact that this person will never change or will never accept Christ – before we rule it out, let us remember that our God can do anything. Let us not lose faith, but pray unceasingly for these dead situations.
The Lord that created this world from nothing, can bring life back to things that seem dead. It may take a process, but we need to walk with the Lord and follow His instructions – like Ezekiel we may have to prophesy a few times until the bones become fully alive. The God who put breath in Adam is able to also put breath back in dead bones. He is able to bring the dead(Lazarus) to life again.
Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’ 12 Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 13 Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. 14 I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I the Lord have spoken, and I have done it, declares the Lord.’”Eze 36:11-14
The meaning of the prophecy is clear, God will bring back life to Israel and put His breath in them again, they will come back to the promised land and He will be their God and they shall be His people.
It is so with us as well, if you find yourself in a place of no hope, due to sin or sickness just return to the Lord who is able to restore you to life. He will put His breath in you and He will be your God and you shall be his child.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
