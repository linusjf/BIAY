### Day #224 Jeremiah’s call is our call

Just reading Jeremiah’s call gives me goosebumps. Our dear “Abba” - Father God knew us before we were born, He formed us in our mother's womb and appointed us to be a prophet to the nations.
Now the word of the Lord came to me saying,
5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
6 Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! Truly I do not know how to speak, for I am only a boy.” 7 But the Lord said to me,
“Do not say, ‘I am only a boy’; for you shall go to all to whom I send you, and you shall speak whatever I command you. 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the Lord.”
9 Then the Lord put out his hand and touched my mouth; and the Lord said to me,
“Now I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, today I appoint you over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.” Jer 1:4-10
We are all called to evangelize, to let our light shine before all. There is no exception to this calling, every Christian is called to bear Christ – that is why we are called Christians (Christian means Christ-bearer). We are supposed to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
It can seem frightening to Evangelize as we may not feel prepared to do so.
Jeremiah was but a boy and the Lord knew that Jeremiah would not feel ready to be a prophet, to speak God’s word. That is why in the call itself God told him not to fear or feel inferior to anyone. God reminds us as we read this, that we should not fear anything or anyone – but rely on God fully. We should only speak what the Lord is guiding us to speak.
Just as the Lord touched the tongue of Jeremiah and anointed and appointed him to be a prophet to the nations. Jesus touches our tongues every time we receive Communion. At the end of Mass, we are commissioned by the priest (Jesus in the person of the priest) to go out and announce the Good news of the Lord. We can go out boldly knowing that God is with us, wherever we go and He will confirm the Good news we announce with signs and wonders. Let us not fear, but step out in faith, for the God who formed us in our mother’s womb is with us, till the end of times.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 224 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 1:4-10
The conversations between God and the prophets are recorded to prove that the prophets were called by God.

Jeremiah 1:5
\*Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”\*

Before Jeremiah was even conceived in the womb, God had already started preparing Jeremiah for his involvement in God’s divine plan.

Before a child is even conceived in the womb, God already has a mission ready for the child.  Abortion and use of birth control techniques are all diabolic because they are Satan’s ways of making sure that God does not fulfill His divine plan for the world.  Therefore, being an obstacle in God’s divine plan is a mortal sin.  Through these ungodly acts we may have destroyed God’s chosen prophets, priests, scientists, rulers, etc. who would have made a positive difference to the world.  We also reduce considerably the number of souls going to Heaven, and we are therefore responsible for the misery and chaos in our homes and in the world which Satan happily gives us in return for obeying him.

It is for God to decide how many children a womb must bring forth.  It is not for us to decide.  As parents we must ensure that all our children receive spiritual nourishment so that all souls receive eternal life.

Jeremiah 1:6-8
In the Jewish community, a male child was a boy till his beard began to grow or until he was 21 years of age.  This means God called Jeremiah very early in his life.

There is no age limit for doing God’s work.  God can call us anytime of our life to be a part of His divine plan.  Abraham was called when he was 75, Moses was called when he was 80, Jeremiah was called when he was less than 21 years of age.
When God calls us for His divine mission we must be ready and willing.
