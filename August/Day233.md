Day 233: Correct me, O Lord — The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)

Fr. Mike reflects on Jeremiah’s sorrow for the people of Israel while reminding us that the one thing we ought to find glory in, is in understanding and knowing God. In our reading of Ezekiel, we hear about God's ongoing promise to restore Israel. Today’s readings are Jeremiah 9, Ezekiel 39, and Proverbs 15:1-4.

### Day #233 By Michael Eltham

Making God in our own image and likeness.

As we read through the Old Testament, we see that idolatry comes up a lot. We read the description of how a tree is cut down, and an artisan carves out idols according to his own imagination. How the metal workers put metal on it, and how the people deck it with gold and silver. The idol is installed in a field or in a temple and people worship it. Although the idol cannot talk or act, cannot move or do good or bad, people worship it as they want. They did whatever shameful acts that they wanted in front of the idols and called it a sacrifice to the god. Do not learn the way of the nations, or be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.

3 For the customs of the peoples are false: a tree from the forest is cut down, and worked with an ax by the hands of an artisan; 4 people deck it with silver and gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails so that it cannot move. 5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak; they have to be carried, for they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, nor is it in them to do good. Jer 10:2-5

Now I’m sure none of us would do such a thing as worship an idol, then how do we apply this in our day and age?

We can be that crafty artisan who makes God according to his own imagination, we could take the real God Jesus Christ and put Him in a box. We can believe things like “It’s okay to sin God will forgive me anyways” or “All God’s are equal and every religion is correct” or “I don’t think Jesus is present in the Eucharist – it’s just a ritual” or “I don’t need to confess my sins to a priest” or “There is no need for community pray – I will just pray in my room” or “It’s fine to live with my partner before marriage if my intention is to marry”.

We can try to interpret scripture to suit our own needs – for example – “Jesus changes gallons of water into wine, that means I should drink a lot” or “Scripture says Keep holy the sabbath – so I can freely sin on other days.”

I think that the new idolatry that we will encounter a lot is not worshiping an idol but making the true God Jesus Christ in our own image and likeness. We make an idol of the true God and think that our imagination is the truth. We are crafty in many ways to twist things and make them fit according to what we like.

Let us seek the Lord in all truth and let Him be Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
