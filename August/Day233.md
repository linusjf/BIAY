Day 233: Correct me, O Lord — The Bible in a Year (with Fr. Mike Schmitz)

Fr. Mike reflects on Jeremiah’s sorrow for the people of Israel while reminding us that the one thing we ought to find glory in, is in understanding and knowing God. In our reading of Ezekiel, we hear about God's ongoing promise to restore Israel. Today’s readings are Jeremiah 9, Ezekiel 39, and Proverbs 15:1-4.
