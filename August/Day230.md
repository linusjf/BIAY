### A New Heart

### Day #230 I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

The Love of the Lord is so great that even though the people of Israel left for idols and fake gods, God never forgot them. God promises to deliver Israel from exile and bring them back to their own land.
‚Äú‚ÄòFor I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 28 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. Eze 36:24-29
There is something more than being brought back to the own land. We all can relate to the warm feeling we get when we get back home. Home is a known safe place where we find comfort and rest. Just as the Israelites we can be living in exile ‚Äì spiritually.
Even though we live in a country that allows us to practice our religion, our hearts may be far from home. Our spiritual home is in God and we find rest, comfort, and peace only in His arms. We may have been living in an exile state of mind, when we sin we move away from God and our hearts become harder, if we continually sin our hearts become like stone. God wants to restore our stony hearts today, we are invited to go back to Him.
He will take away our hearts of stone and give us a heart of flesh, a heart that loves God and neighbor. We may be led by our own spirit or worldly spirits ‚Äì God will fill us with the Holy Spirit that will lead us to all truth. We will be washed by the blood of the lamb, made holy and pure. The new Spirit that we receive will help us to follow God‚Äôs ways, the Holy Spirit our helper will empower us to live holy lives.
Let us return to the Lord, trade our hearts of stone for a heart of flesh, and be filled by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us.

Jeremiah 7:13-14
*And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your ancestors, just what I did to Shiloh.*

Even if we have been spending long hours in praise and worship and prayer, we can still be spiritually indifferent if our hearts are not with the Lord.

Jeremiah 7:16
*As for you, do not pray for this people, do not raise a cry or prayer on their behalf, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you.*

Constantly interceding for the people was one of the important duties of a prophet.

Jeremiah 7:18
*Queen of Heaven.*

This was the goddess Ishtar who was believed by the people to be a goddess of fertility, love and war.

Jeremiah 7:22-23
*For in the day that I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to them or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.  But this command I gave them, ‚ÄúObey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk only in the way that I command you, so that it may be well with you.‚Äù*

Our sacrifices and offerings have no value when we live in disobedience to God.
Although this command was given to the Israelites during the time of Moses (Exodus 19:5), the same command is applicable to us too.

Ezekiel 36:23-24
*I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.  I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.*

In the old Covenant, Israel was supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world but, instead, they allowed the darkness of idolatry to seep into their own lifestyle.  Therefore, they were being prepared for exile.  But exile was not meant for God to get His back at the people. Exile was how God got His people back to Him.

In the new Covenant, Christians are supposed to glorify God‚Äôs name by being a light to the world (Matthew 5:16).  So let us not make the same mistake by allowing the darkness of idolatry (wealth, power, comfort and pleasures of this world) to seep into our lifestyles.  Let us focus more on God, and not on accumulating wealth and possessions, or else we too may have to face a similar exile (physical or spiritual or maybe both).

Ezekiel 36:25-28
*I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.  A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.  Then you shall live in the land that I gave to your ancestors; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

In the old Covenant, ritual washing with water was only a symbol of baptism. The water just cleaned their bodies externally.  It never cleansed anyone of their sins.
Ezekiel was prophesying about baptism in the new Covenant.  God promised to give us His divine Spirit through our baptism, which was inaugurated when the Holy Spirit anointed Jesus during His baptism.

In the new Covenant, baptism is not an upgraded ritual of the past.  Baptism gives us the Spirit of God, that is, divine life, thus making us members of God's family, but the actual grace of baptism comes to us from Jesus through the baptized humans who baptize us, as it does with all the other sacraments as well.

The Holy Spirit was released to the world only once, on Pentecost Sunday, and it is the same Spirit which is given to each one of us individually through the sacraments.
