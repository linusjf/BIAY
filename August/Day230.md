### Day #230 I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

The Love of the Lord is so great that even though the people of Israel left for idols and fake gods, God never forgot them. God promises to deliver Israel from exile and bring them back to their own land.
“‘For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land. 25 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. 28 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God. 29 I will save you from all your uncleanness. Eze 36:24-29
There is something more than being brought back to the own land. We all can relate to the warm feeling we get when we get back home. Home is a known safe place where we find comfort and rest. Just as the Israelites we can be living in exile – spiritually.
Even though we live in a country that allows us to practice our religion, our hearts may be far from home. Our spiritual home is in God and we find rest, comfort, and peace only in His arms. We may have been living in an exile state of mind, when we sin we move away from God and our hearts become harder, if we continually sin our hearts become like stone. God wants to restore our stony hearts today, we are invited to go back to Him.
He will take away our hearts of stone and give us a heart of flesh, a heart that loves God and neighbor. We may be led by our own spirit or worldly spirits – God will fill us with the Holy Spirit that will lead us to all truth. We will be washed by the blood of the lamb, made holy and pure. The new Spirit that we receive will help us to follow God’s ways, the Holy Spirit our helper will empower us to live holy lives.
Let us return to the Lord, trade our hearts of stone for a heart of flesh, and be filled by His Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us.
