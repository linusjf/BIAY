### BIAY Day 232 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 9:11-16
Why must judgement fall on God's people?
Because of their defiant attitude towards God, rejection of God's Law, preference for false gods and refusal to repent.

Let us check if we are any different from those people.

*If you listen to my voice, and do all that I command you, then you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

This was the covenantal condition since the beginning of time and will be the same until the end of time.
