### BIAY Day 232 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 9:11-16
Why must judgement fall on God's people?
Because of their defiant attitude towards God, rejection of God's Law, preference for false gods and refusal to repent.

Let us check if we are any different from those people.

*If you listen to my voice, and do all that I command you, then you shall be my people, and I will be your God.*

This was the covenantal condition since the beginning of time and will be the same until the end of time.

### Day#232 By Michael Eltham

Let us not boast in our wisdom, might or wealth but in the knowledge of Christ.
There are many wise, wealthy, and mighty people in this world. Many people are in a rat race to become wise, wealthy, and mighty and spend their entire lives perusing these things. Wisdom, wealth, and Might are good things and we should peruse them and be prosperous. There is nothing wrong is learning, accumulating wealth and building your strength. But we should not boast in them, we should only use them as created things and always treat them as dirt in comparison to our faith life.
23 Thus says the Lord: Do not let the wise boast in their wisdom, do not let the mighty boast in their might, do not let the wealthy boast in their wealth; 24 but let those who boast boast in this, that they understand and know me, that I am the Lord; I act with steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight, says the Lord.
Let us never boast in our accomplishments but rather boast in our relationship with the Lord. Let us remember that all good comes from the Lord and that we and our attributes are nothing but a gift from the Lord. All human wisdom is nothing but foolishness to God.
18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”; 20 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! 1 Cor 3:18-21
We should not boast in our wisdom as the wisdom of the world is foolishness in God's sight. We should boast in the knowledge of the Lord, for knowing God is the greatest thing that can ever happen to us, and having a relationship with God is the greatest achievement that one can have. St Paul was a learned Jew who was persecuting the Christians and finally converted, his letters are so filled with wisdom and he achieved many things in his life.
7 Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. 10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death, 11 if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
We like St Paul should consider everything as rubbish in comparison to the value of knowing Christ. Our wisdom, might, and wealth are all utter rubbish compared to our dear Lord Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
