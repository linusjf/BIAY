### Day #238 By Michael Eltham

God is greater than our diet.

King Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, brought some young men from the Israelites to his palace to train them and probably give them some role in the place.

3 Then the king commanded his palace master Ashpenaz to bring some of the Israelites of the royal family and of the nobility, 4 young men without physical defect and handsome, versed in every branch of wisdom, endowed with knowledge and insight, and competent to serve in the king’s palace; they were to be taught the literature and language of the Chaldeans. 5 The king assigned them a daily portion of the royal rations of food and wine. They were to be educated for three years, so that at the end of that time they could be stationed in the king’s court. 6 Among them were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, from the tribe of Judah. Daniel 1: 3-6

Now Daniel did not want to eat the food from the palace, probably offered to the pagan gods. Daniel takes a step of faith and requests to eat only vegetables and water instead of eating the rich food from the royal rations.

11 Then Daniel asked the guard whom the palace master had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 12 “Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. 13 You can then compare our appearance with the appearance of the young men who eat the royal rations, and deal with your servants according to what you observe.” 14 So he agreed to this proposal and tested them for ten days. 15 At the end of ten days it was observed that they appeared better and fatter than all the young men who had been eating the royal rations. 16 So the guard continued to withdraw their royal rations and the wine they were to drink, and gave them vegetables. 17 To these four young men God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and wisdom; Daniel also had insight into all visions and dreams. Daniel 1:11-17

Such a great Miracle – it was initiated by Daniel’s faith.

The lesson to learn is that we should not blindly follow what the world tells us to do. Our faith and hope should be in the Lord and not in what we eat and drink. One can be too focused on diet and medicine and forget to trust God. Now diet is important, and we should follow it – but we should trust God first. On the lighter side – Eat your veggies is biblical 😀and no one’s mom put it in the Bible (Line from Fr Mike).
This act of faith helped Daniel to have more faith when we accepted to interpret the dream of the King. In fact, the King actually asked the wise men to tell him what the dream was. Here we see the spotlight on intercessory prayer and how it saved the Israelite men.

17 Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 18 and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish. 19 Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel 2:17-19

Once God revealed the mystery to Daniel and Daniel explained it to the King. Daniel and his companions were elevated to great positions. Let us take courage from this and have faith even when all prospects seem low. Have Faith and the Lord will do Miracles.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Jeremiah 21:14

*I will kindle a fire in its forest.*

Jerusalem does not have any forests.
A section of the palace of Solomon was known as "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (1 Kings 7:2-4).
Therefore, this was a warning about the destruction of Solomon’s palace.

Daniel 1:7

*The palace master / chief chamberlain changed their names:*
*Daniel to Belteshazzar, Hananiyah to Shadrach, Mishael to Meshach, and Azariyah to Abednego.*

Why the name change?
The young men's Hebrew names were unacceptable to the Babylonians because the meaning of their Hebrew names centered on the one true God:
DaniEl = Elohim is my judge;
HananiYah = Yahweh has been gracious;
MishaEl = who is what Elohim is;
AzariYah = Yahweh has helped.
(“El” is short for Elohim, and “Yah” is short for Yahweh.  Both are Hebrew names speaking of or praising God)

The king of Babylon had the names of Daniel and his companions changed to represent the names of the pagan gods.
The meanings of their “new” names centered on the false Babylonian gods:
Bel tashazzar = Bel will protect;
ShadrAch = inspired of Aku;
MeshAch = belonging to Aku;
AbedNego = servant of Nego.

The king changed their God-given identity to reflect the pagan identity.
Assigning new names was a common court practice in the ancient world. Its intention was to change the entire identity of the bearers, by training them, until their lives matched their names.
The pagan kings followed this practice to change the identity of the Jews to absorb them into the pagan culture.

What about us?
When we were baptized, we took on the name "Christian" which means “follower of Christ.”
How serious are we, as Christians, to change our identities until our life matches the meaning of our identity "follower of Christ"?

Have we tried to evangelize the people around us and shine our light (Matthew 5:16) to change the ungodly culture into a godly one or have we blended with the ungodly culture ourselves?

Daniel and his three companions were, however, never absorbed themselves into Babylonian culture. They neither worshipped the gods of the Babylonians nor did they eat unforbidden foods.  They remained faithful to their God all through their time in Babylon.

Daniel 2:31-45
According to Daniel’s prophecy, the Messiah (the little stone) would bring the Kingdom of Heaven on earth (the Church) when the fourth kingdom (the Roman empire / iron) would be in power, the first 3 kingdoms being the Babylonian (gold), the Persian (silver) and the Greek (bronze) empires.

The Babylonian empire was in power from around 2000 BC upto the 6th century BC when it was taken over by Persia around 539 BC;
the Persian empire was in power upto the 4th century BC when it was taken over by Greece around 334 BC;
and the Greek empire was in power upto the 2nd century BC when it was taken over by Rome around 146 BC.

According to this prophecy the stone Kingdom would be universal and would spread all over the globe, but this does not mean that every single human would accept Christ.

When Christianity entered the world the pagan Roman kingdom vanished because majority of the pagans converted to Christianity by the 4th century AD.
