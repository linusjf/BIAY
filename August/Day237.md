Fr. Mike guides us through the last two chapters of Ezekiel, explaining the biblical significance of the water flowing from the right side of the temple, and how it foreshadows Christ's passion. He also emphasizes the imagery of the clay and the potter in Jeremiah, signifying how our lives are meant to be open for God to mold and shape, according to his will. Today's readings are Jeremiah 18-19, Ezekiel 47-48, and Proverbs 15:21-24.

The Potter and the clay

The best way to understand this reading is to imagine walking with Jeremiah to the potter‚Äôs house. The clay cannot make itself, it cannot even decide what shape it wants to be. Left on its own the clay will just stay spinning, however when the potter starts shaping the clay that is when it becomes a masterpiece of the potter. The potter would make it for whatever purpose he desired.

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 2 ‚ÄúArise, and go down to the potter‚Äôs house, and there I will let you hear my words.‚Äù 3 So I went down to the potter‚Äôs house, and there he was working at his wheel. 4 And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter‚Äôs hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. 5 Then the word of the Lord came to me: 6 ‚ÄúO house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? says the Lord. Behold, like the clay in the potter‚Äôs hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. 7 If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, 8 and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it. Jer 18:1-8

Just as the potter of the clay can make the clay into the shape that he desires, God is in control of our lives and shapes us. It does not matter how much of a mess we are in, the Potter can make it beautiful. If the vessel that the potter was making was spoiled in the potter‚Äôs hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. In the same way, if we have ruined the opportunities that the Lord gave us, we can always trust the Lord to rebuild us and rework us to do something new and make us a valuable vessel for His service. The important thing is to remain in the hands of the potter. God calls us to do something, but we fail as we are frail humans like frail clay. Even if we fail, all is not lost because our creator can remake us, if He made us from dust He can recreate us into something beautiful.

On the other hand, we cannot say that we have been good and demand a good future. Again the reason we are good or blessed is due to the grace of God, all we can do is Thank God for what we had and just trust Him for the future. We are just clay, we cannot demand that the potter use us for royal use only.

It does not matter what shape we are in spiritually or how good or bad we are, the important thing is to be humble and to be in the hands of the potter. We must abandon ourselves to the Lord and His will in our lives. Just as the clay is molded by the potter, we need to be led and shaped by the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit is the water flowing from the side of Christ, the temple described in Ezekiel is the Body of Christ. The water that is flowing from the east(right) side of the temple (Eze 47) is the Blood and water flowing from the right side of the Christ as depicted on the Crucifix. The water flowing from the temple brings life in all seasons in abundance. Let us be clay in the hands of the Lord being watered by the Holy Spirit, recreated every day, and renewed in our spirits.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
