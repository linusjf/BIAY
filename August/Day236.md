### BIAY Day 236 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 16:16
*Fishers and hunters.*

In the future God would send fishers to find the Israelites because they would be scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing.  The gentiles/lost tribes, who would be living in the woodlands, would have to be found by hunters.

Jeremiah 17:5-10
Trees that grow beside water banks are not affected by heat or drought because their roots are always close to water. They don't even depend on humans to provide them with water.

Like those trees, if we are deeply rooted in Christ, the living water, then we will never be disturbed with whatever crisis the devil throws in our lap (whether it is family problem, job problem, financial problem, health problem, political problem or any other problem) because God will always be with us.
Jesus comes to us through the sacraments, and stays with us to help us walk through the storms.

### Day #236 By Michael Eltham

Our hearts are deceitful above all things

We know our hearts and are fully aware of the type of person we are. We can put on a mask for the world to see and hide stuff from our family but not from God. For God searches the minds and tries the hearts. Our God is our maker and is fully aware of us – through and through.

The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately corrupt; who can understand it? “I the Lord search the mind and try the heart, to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.” Jer 17:9-10

Our hearts are corrupt, and we make it hard every time we sin. We keep fighting our conscience, and our minds become dull to do the right thing. From the heart come all sorts of evil, which are translated into actions.
From within, from the human heart, evil intentions come fornication, theft, murder, 22 adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, and folly. 23 All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.” Mark 7:21-23

As Jesus taught, all evil starts in the hearts and then becomes thoughts and actions. Let us do some self-evaluation of our hearts and prayerfully discern to see if our hearts have any of those evils mentioned above.

As we pray and discover the evil within us, we cannot help but cry out for healing. Let us join Jeremiah in this earnest prayer.
Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; Jer 17:14

It’s a good practice to pray this prayer several times a day and ask God for healing of hearts.

Another prayer that can help in healing the heart is the “Jesus prayer” – The Easter Christians have used this prayer to great advantage – praying this simple yet effective prayer repeatably

"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." Some practice praying this with every breath, and many saints have prayed this prayer until their last breath. Joan of Arc died with the one word Jesus on her lips.

Let us practice praying this many times a day, this prayer will bring healing to our deceitful hearts.

"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
