### BIAY Day 236 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 16:16
*Fishers and hunters.*

In the future God would send fishers to find the Israelites because they would be scattered along the coastlines due to their occupations of fishing, farming and animal rearing.  The gentiles/lost tribes, who would be living in the woodlands, would have to be found by hunters.

Jeremiah 17:5-10
Trees that grow beside water banks are not affected by heat or drought because their roots are always close to water. They don't even depend on humans to provide them with water.

Like those trees, if we are deeply rooted in Christ, the living water, then we will never be disturbed with whatever crisis the devil throws in our lap (whether it is family problem, job problem, financial problem, health problem, political problem or any other problem) because God will always be with us.
Jesus comes to us through the sacraments, and stays with us to help us walk through the storms.
