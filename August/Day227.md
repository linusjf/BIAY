### Day #227 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskin of your hearts.

Sometimes our faith life can get limited to the outward following of rituals instead of heart-filled worship. We can be going through the motions in our spiritual life and not even know it. We may be praying but our heart is far from the Lord. The Jewish people have lost the true essence of the covenant they had with the Lord. They needed a wake-up call, a great awakening. The Lord is trying to get His people back, prophet after prophet is calling out to the people to repent. Prophet Jeremiah has been preaching repentance for years now, he cries out.
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord,
remove the foreskin of your hearts Jer 4:4
It is very important to be cut to the heart, each time we repent. Just following the customs or babbling prayers may make us just like the Pharisees and teachers of the Law who stood on street corners and prayed lengthy prayers and made a big show of the charity they did.
We are called to make humble prayers, prayers of a child to the Father. For God will hear those prayers that come from the heart.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Mat 6:6
When we make a confession, we are usually listing out all the sins that we committed. Along with confessing those sins, we should also take resolve, to avoid them in the future. The Change has to be in the heart, truly sincere and genuine. A contrite heart the Lord will not despise.
The heart is where all sin originates and then becomes actions. Jesus reminds us that outward customs of washing of hands is not as important as having a clean heart.
Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer? 18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles. 19 For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. 20 These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.” Mat 15:16-19
So let us examine our hearts and circumcise ourselves to the Lord, remove the foreskin of the heart(Speaking metaphorically like the Scripture.). Let us rend our hearts and not our garments.
May the Holy Spirit lead us.
