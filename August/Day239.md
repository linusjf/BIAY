### Day #239 When you walk through fire you shall not be burned

King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue and commanded everyone to worship it, however, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship this false god.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with rage against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face was distorted. He ordered the furnace heated up seven times more than was customary, 20 and ordered some of the strongest guards in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 21 So the men were bound, still wearing their tunics, their trousers, their hats, and their other garments, and they were thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. 22 Because the king‚Äôs command was urgent and the furnace was so overheated, the raging flames killed the men who lifted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 23 But the three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire. Daniel 3:19-23
Can you imagine how hot this furnace must have been that even the men who tried to throw these 3 into it got burnt. The King and the audience would have expected these three to become toast in seconds, however, the fire did not affect them. They started walking around singing hymns and praising God.
They walked around in the midst of the flames, singing hymns to God and blessing the Lord. 25 Then Azariah stood still in the fire and prayed aloud:
26 ‚ÄúBlessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors, and worthy of praise; and glorious is your name forever! 27 For you are just in all you have done; all your works are true and your ways right, and all your judgments are true. Dan 3:24-27
Now the King got even more furious and ordered that the fire be stoked.
Now the king‚Äôs servants who threw them in kept stoking the furnace with naphtha, pitch, tow, and brushwood. 47 And the flames poured out above the furnace forty-nine cubits, 48 and spread out and burned those Chaldeans who were caught near the furnace. 49 But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace to be with Azariah and his companions, and drove the fiery flame out of the furnace, 50 and made the inside of the furnace as though a moist wind were whistling through it. The fire did not touch them at all and caused them no pain or distress. Dan 3:46-50
The three praised God in the midst of the fire and the Lord sent an angel to their rescue. The inside of the furnace became moist, and the fire did not touch them. This reminds me of the promise we received in Isaiah that when we go through the fire we will not be burnt, and the flames will not consume us.
‚ÄúFear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. 2 When you pass through the waters I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. 3 For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. Is 43:1-3
King Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs heart changed ‚Äì when he witnessed this great Miracle.
And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king‚Äôs counselors gathered together and saw that the fire had not had any power over the bodies of those men; the hair of their heads was not singed, their tunics were not harmed, and not even the smell of fire came from them. 95 Nebuchadnezzar said, ‚ÄúBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king‚Äôs command and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. 96 Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that utters blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins; for there is no other god who is able to deliver in this way.‚Äù 97 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon. Dan 3: 94-97
So the next time you face a situation where you feel that you are thrown into the fire, remember that you will not be burnt. Just praise God and sing hymns to the Lord, He will send angels to be with us and protect us. The people who threw us into the fire will see this great Miracle and change and praise God.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 239 By Cynthia Dsilva

Daniel 3:1-96
The ultimate test, for the chosen young men and all other Jews, was when the king made a gigantic golden statue of one of their false gods and commanded all the people to worship it or they would be thrown into the furnace.  All the Jews bowed down to worship the false god except Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.  The men were given a second chance but they refused with the trust that their God would save them from the fire, and even if God didn‚Äôt save them they wouldn‚Äôt bow down to the false god anyway.
They were eventually thrown into the fire but they remained completely unharmed inside the furnace.  They walked about in the flames, praying, singing to God and blessing the Lord.

We too are living in the midst of the flames of an evil culture.
How do we respond to the ungodly culture around us?
Do we stand for Christ or do we flow with the crowd?
If we had to lose our jobs, homes, lives, position, status, reputation, or anything else, for being faithful to Christ, would we still continue following Christ and stand for the truth or would we compromise so that we look like peaceful and good people in front of others?
It is not wrong to be peaceful and good, but God doesn‚Äôt want us to be peaceful and good by rejecting His Son and His commandments.

Although God was with the 3 young men in the furnace, He did not remove them from the furnace.  He was waiting with them because of their obedience to Him and, in the meanwhile, He was testing them.

If God is with us it doesn‚Äôt mean that we will be free of problems.  As long as we obey God He will be with us.  Facing problems when God is with us means He is testing us.

The pagan king considered himself as a god and therefore, before throwing the 3 young men into the furnace, he asked them ‚Äúwho is the God who can deliver you out of my hands?‚Äù  But after seeing that the flames had not touch the 3 young men at all the king released them and gave orders that if anyone in the land spoke any word against the God of Israel that person would be cut to pieces.
Thus the Jews were able to worship the God of Israel even though they were under the pagan rule.

The 3 young men‚Äôs faith and trust in God changed the mind of the pagan king about the God of Israel and our God.
Do we have enough faith and trust in Christ to change the minds of the people around us and bring them to Christ?

Daniel 3:92
*"......... and the fourth looks like a son of God.‚Äù*
What Nebuchadnezzar saw was a heavenly being, an angel of the Lord (Daniel 3:95).

Daniel 3:25
*Azariah stood up in the midst of the fire and prayed aloud.*
Daniel didn't learn to trust God when he was protected in the lion's den (Daniel 6:16-22)) and his companions didn't learn to trust God when they were protected in the fiery furnace by the angel.  Their faith was not built on the battlefield.  Their faith had grown strong because of their daily humble prayers and obedience to God in every situation.  This faith and obedience gave them the courage to defy the King's ungodly law.

Likewise, our daily humble prayers, preferably on our knees, and our obedience to God in every situation, is what builds up our courage to reject evil even if it means we have to go through trials and tribulations.  We cannot fight the spiritual battle if we remember God occasionally or only when we are in distress.

A soldier cannot be victorious in a battle if he neglects his daily training and discipline and relaxes most of the time.
An athlete cannot win a race by training occasionally.
*It's what we do constantly that makes the difference.*

Proverbs 15:29
*The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.*

Daniel was a righteous man.  When Daniel prayed God heard his prayer on day 1 but God's answer reached Daniel after 21 days because the angel was being blocked by the demons who were empowered by the increasing sins of Israel (Daniel 10:12-13).

When the Canaanite woman prayed for her daughter's deliverance from bondage Jesus was sitting near her and He heard her prayer but He did not respond to her request immediately.  He wanted to test her faith before answering her prayer (Matthew 15:21-28).

God does hear the prayers of the righteous ones but the answers may not always be "yes" and the response may not always be instant.  If there is a delay we need to first examine ourselves to check if we are living our lives according to God's Will or whether we have any intention to do so.  If we are, then maybe God is teaching us patience, or testing our faith, or maybe we are asking for the wrong things.
