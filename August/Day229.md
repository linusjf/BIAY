### Day #229 The Lord will be our Shepherd

As we read through the OT we see that the Spiritual leaders were not really doing what they were called to. They are not taking good care of those entrusted to their care.
The word of the Lord came to me: 2 ‚ÄúSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? 3 You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. 4 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. 5 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. 6 My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. Eze 34:1-6
Sometimes parishes can face this problem when the pastor does not be a shepherd to the flock. This could be the case when a Parent does not care for the children. This could be the case when a teacher does not really take care of her class. Everyone is called to serve in some capacity or the other and when we fail to live up to our calling, we end up like the shepherds of Israel. Failing in our responsibility is actually okay as long as we want to do better and try to improve. As long as we are not like the shepherds of Israel who only took care of themselves, who ate and cloth themselves well and ignored the people under their care. Who did not bind up the wounds properly.
They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, ‚ÄúPeace, peace,‚Äù when there is no peace. Jer 6:14
Let us not tell people that all is good when things are not good, we should be genuine in our message and care for others. The shepherds of Israel would give false hope to the people telling them that everything is fine when it actually was not. They would say Peace when there was no peace.
Let the bad example of the shepherds of Israel lead us to become good shepherds. Good shepherds after the heart of Jesus ‚ÄúThe Good Shepherd‚Äù.
Jesus the Good shepherd fulfilled this promise that God made us through the prophet Ezekiel.
11 ‚Äú‚ÄòFor this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. 12 As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. 13 I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. 14 I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 15 I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign Lord. 16 I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. Eze 33: 11-16
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 229 By Cynthia Dsilva

Jeremiah 6:17
*I raised up sentinels for you, ‚ÄúGive heed to the sound of the trumpet!‚Äù*

Sentinels are watchmen who must remain awake and alert, without a break, while on duty.  They are put in charge of the four towers above the city gate to watch for any possible enemies and alert the king and his people of any possible danger.
A prophet functions in a similar manner.  His duty is to protect God's people from the spiritual enemy (Satan).

Ezekiel 34:11-12
*For thus says the Lord God: I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.  As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep have been scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness.*

There were many false shepherds in ancient Israel who led God‚Äôs people astray.  During the time of Jesus the false shepherds were king Herod (he was not from the Davidic family) and the High Priests Annas and Caiaphas (they were not from the Aaronic family).  Whichever families they came from, in their role as king and priests their duty was to lead the people to God but they became rich by abusing the people, they led ungodly lives themselves and led the people away from God.

God promised that He would rescue His lost sheep on the day of the crucifixion of Jesus, in the presence of Jews from all over the world, when there would be clouds and thick darkness due to an eclipse (Matthew 27:45).

As commanded by God, through Moses, all Jewish men had to celebrate Passover and Pentecost once a year ‚Äúonly in Jerusalem.‚Äù  This was planned by God so that every Jewish man would be present on Passover day when Jesus would die on the Cross to save them and the rest of the world.  They later gathered again in Jerusalem on Pentecost Sunday, 50 days after the Resurrection of Jesus, and 3,000 Jews, from all over the world, were baptized that day and thus they were rescued (Acts 2:7-11 & 37-41).
