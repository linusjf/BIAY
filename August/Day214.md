### Day #214 Can a woman forget her nursing child?

The love of a mother is the strongest human love that anyone can experience (although there can be exceptions). A mother’s love is so great that she is ready to sacrifice her own joy for the joy of the children. She will do anything it takes to see her children succeed. We can all relate to the warm love our mothers showed us, and the care and comfort we found in her bosom. Mother’s love is demonstrated in the lovely food they made, the clean house they kept, and the hard work they did in the house and at the office as well. Mothers don’t ever take sick days; they are constantly working to keep the family happy. The love of a mother for her newborn is admirable, she will keep up all night to ensure the baby is happy. Although the love of a mother is great, there can be times when she will not be the mother she is called to be. Mothers are human as well and can have many flaws. Even if a mother will forsake her infant, God will never abandon us or forsake us.
But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.” Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. See, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. Is 49:14-16
The Lord called me before I was born, while I was in my mother’s womb he named me. Is 49:1
The Lord is our true parent, He had named us even when we were in our mother’s womb. The Lord has inscribed us on the palms of His hands. We are truly loved and admired by our God. Even if everyone on earth leaves us if we are abandoned by our parents, children, friends, spouse, family, and siblings the Lord will never leave us. We can always trust God to be there for us, even if human beings leave us.
The best place to be is in the arms of Abba father. We sometimes overthink or overanalyze our faith, we just need to be held by God sometimes. He is our father and we are His Children. We will not be forgotten.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 214 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 49:1-4
The *servant of the Lord* is Jesus as well as Israel, therefore what was true for Jesus and the old Israel is also true for the new Israel (the Christians).

The Lord plans our mission on earth long before we are born and sends us to the earth to carry out that mission while we also earn our living, just as it was with Jesus.
Let us therefore ask the Lord to help us know what our mission is and surrender ourselves to Him so that He can carry out that mission through us, as He wills.
Let us glorify the Lord by sharing the Word of God with the people around us, starting with our families, friends, relatives, neighbours, colleagues, etc.
Let us also glorify the Lord by loving and caring for everyone including our enemies.

Let us allow God to continue working through us even though we cannot see the fruit of our efforts in the midst of an evil world.
