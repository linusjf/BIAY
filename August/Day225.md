### Day #225 Cracked cisterns instead of fountains of living water

Prophet Jeremiah speaks this message of the people's betrayal; the Israelites have forsaken the Lord.
The Lord is shocked, that his own people – the ones he brought out of slavery into the promised land, have abandoned Him. The Israelites have committed two evils, they have forsaken the fountains of living waters and have created cracked cisterns that don’t even hold water.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord, 13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 2 Jer 12,13
We have in some way or the other forsaken God and got attached to things of this world instead. We have abandoned the love, joy, and peace that comes from a good relationship with the Lord to a self-seeking, self-centered view of things – where we are more concerned about our status, health, looks, wealth, and comfort.
St Augustine in the first Chapter of “The confessions” states that we will never rest until we rest in the Lord.
You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.
We have abandoned a 'life in the Spirit, the life where the Holy Spirit will become a spring of water gushing up to heaven. We are led by worldly thoughts and ideas. We are running after things that perish and rot. Instead of being led by the Spirit, we are being led by our desires and passions – which are the cisterns that are cracked. We will never be satisfied no matter how much earthly success, wealth, beauty, lust, drunkenness, status, or comfort we may get.
Let us choose the Holy Spirit, the living waters, the life springs instead of worldly things.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Ezekiel 28:12-17
God told Ezekiel to speak to Satan who was behind the king’s evil deeds.

Unlike humans, angels have a superior intellect by which they can clearly see the consequences of their choices in advance and therefore there is no forgiveness for them when they disobey God.  Inspite of that, Lucifer chose to be the topmost in an inferior order rather than becoming one among others in a superior order.
In other words, Lucifer chose to be king in Hell as opposed to being a servant in Heaven

Let us make sure that we don’t push others under our feet to obtain a higher position, whatever field we are in.
As followers of Christ, let us always look for opportunities to serve others.

Ezekiel 28:16
*What was Lucifer’s iniquity?*

Lucifer was chased out of God’s family (Heaven) because he was too busy with things that were taking him away from God, and eventually, in his pride, he started claiming equality with God (v. 2). Therefore he lost the anointing.  It is the same spirit which he puts in the minds of those who are hungry for power and success.

In the abundance of too many worldly activities, there is a possibility that we too may be filled with constant violence, anger and irritation. We may be having too many responsibilities, too many problems, too many things on our head, and then we sin.  We may also be too busy focusing on our success in life.

If we lead a busy life, with so many worldly activities which are not connected to spiritual activities, then there is a possibility that we too will lose the presence of God within us, and we will be chased out of God’s family (Heaven) if we have not repented and confessed our sins before our death.

Angels don’t have the option to repent for their sins and therefore Lucifer and his minions will remain permanently out of Heaven.  But we, humans, are so blessed that God, in His love for us, has given us, in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the option to repent and renew the Covenant, which we break with our sins.  Therefore, let us not ignore or reject God’s mercy; let us ensure to repent and confess our sins and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly so that we can remain in a Covenant relation with God at all times.

JEREMIAH speaks of the intimacy of the Covenant Relationship between God and Israel denoting love, loyalty and a devotion like a young bride to the Lord. Israel was God's first fruit of the Nature.

According to the Old Testament, first fruit of the harvest belonged to God. The lsraelites had the full resources to God, the Living Water, yet took roads to broken cisterns or a black river. As Verse 37 "Your hands on your heads" Indicates, subject to foreign power.
EZEKIEL emphasized the gravity of sins of the King of Tyre. Verse 18 Fire represents God's Judgment.
PROVERBS speaks of the right way that leads to success and happiness and obedience to the Will of God. Sin is often able to hide its own character, an easy path that leads to an early death.
