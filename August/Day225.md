### Day #225 Cracked cisterns instead of fountains of living water

Prophet Jeremiah speaks this message of the people's betrayal; the Israelites have forsaken the Lord.
The Lord is shocked, that his own people – the ones he brought out of slavery into the promised land, have abandoned Him. The Israelites have committed two evils, they have forsaken the fountains of living waters and have created cracked cisterns that don’t even hold water.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the Lord, 13 for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water. 2 Jer 12,13
We have in some way or the other forsaken God and got attached to things of this world instead. We have abandoned the love, joy, and peace that comes from a good relationship with the Lord to a self-seeking, self-centered view of things – where we are more concerned about our status, health, looks, wealth, and comfort.
St Augustine in the first Chapter of “The confessions” states that we will never rest until we rest in the Lord.
You have made us for Yourself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.
We have abandoned a 'life in the Spirit, the life where the Holy Spirit will become a spring of water gushing up to heaven. We are led by worldly thoughts and ideas. We are running after things that perish and rot. Instead of being led by the Spirit, we are being led by our desires and passions – which are the cisterns that are cracked. We will never be satisfied no matter how much earthly success, wealth, beauty, lust, drunkenness, status, or comfort we may get.
Let us choose the Holy Spirit, the living waters, the life springs instead of worldly things.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
