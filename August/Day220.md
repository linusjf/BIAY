### Day #220 The oil of gladness instead of mourning

At the start of Jesus' public ministry, he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; 2 to proclaim the year of the Lord‚Äôs favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; 3 to provide for those who mourn in Zion‚Äî to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit. Is 61:1-3
Jesus read from Isaiah, and when he finished reading it.
‚ÄúAnd he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them, ‚ÄúToday this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.‚Äù Luke 4: 20,21
We have such a blessing in Jesus, God with us ‚Äì Emmanuel. Jesus came to bring good news to us the oppressed, He came to bind up the brokenhearted ‚Äì God is close to the brokenhearted (Psalm 34). Jesus came to set up free from sin and death, we were captives to sin we were prisoners to death ‚Äì there is no salvation for us without Jesus as we are sinful people. Jesus came to proclaim the year of favor ‚Äì instead of God‚Äôs vengeance Jesus brought us comfort. God does not deal with us according to our sins, He gives us a garland instead of ashes, oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.
We are called to be a people of Praise and celebration. We should be rejoicing because of what Jesus has done for us. By His death and resurrection Jesus cloths us with righteousness and with garments of salvation.
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. Is 61:10
Jesus clothes us in garments of holiness, by the blood of His sacrifice. We are called to the wedding banquet of the Eucharist where the Bridegroom - Jesus rejoices over His bride the Church.
For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your builder marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you. Is 62:5
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
