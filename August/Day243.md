### Day #243 God‚Äôs plan for us is for our welfare not for evil.

We have read a lot about the false prophets, and how to speak on their own, they do not seek the Lord‚Äôs will. They only say words of comfort and prosperity, instead of speaking a message of repentance (the people were in a state of sin and needed to repent). Prophet Jeremiah was walking around with a yoke on his neck, as a visible icon that would remind the people that they are under the yoke of sin and are slaves because of their rebellion. Prophet Jeremiah heard from the Lord that Israel will be in exile for 70 years and after that, they will be restored back to Israel.
However, prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah speaks a false message that the yoke will be broken in 2 years. Prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah took the wooden yoke off Jeremiah and broke it, and Jeremiah went his way.
10 Then the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and broke them. 11 And Hanani‚Ä≤ah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, ‚ÄúThus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.‚Äù But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.
12 Sometime after the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah: 13 ‚ÄúGo, tell Hanani‚Ä≤ah, ‚ÄòThus says the Lord: You have broken wooden bars, but I will make in their place bars of iron. 14 For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke of servitude to Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.‚Äô‚Äù 15 And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah, ‚ÄúListen, Hanani‚Ä≤ah, the Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. 16 Therefore thus says the Lord: ‚ÄòBehold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the Lord.‚Äô‚Äù
17 In that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah died. Jer 28
The word of the Lord then came to Jeremiah that even though prophet Hanani‚Ä≤ah broke the wooden bars but the Lord will place Iron bars on Israel and that they cannot break, and will serve King Nebuchadnez‚Ä≤zar. Prophet Jeremiah also prophesied that the false prophet will die this very year which happened. Now we need to be clear that God does not want to keep the people of Israel in exile, but wants them to repent. The thing that is most precious in the Lord‚Äôs sight is our soul, it is the most precious thing to us as well(we just don‚Äôt know it, we think our body is the most important thing.) The Lord will permit physical suffering if it cleanses the soul, the Israelites wanted the blessings of the Lord but did not want to be His.
This could be the struggle in our lives as well, we may be seeking the Lord only for the things of this world and not bother much about our soul and the next world. God‚Äôs plans for us to prosper us ‚Äì the best way to prosper us is to make our souls pure. Even if the Lord gave us abundant earthly prosperity ‚Äì we will never be satisfied. The only way we will be whole is when we become holy/complete/whole, of course not on our own but by what Christ did for us on the cross. So when we experience suffering on earth it may just be the yoke that Lord wants us to carry, so that it will condition our hearts and purify our souls to holiness.
Through the process of purification, we may get so frustrated with the yoke/suffering in our life that we just want to break it. This will not help, trying to avoid suffering will not help us progress. We need to pickup our cross and follow the Lord daily. If we break the yoke of wood, the Lord will place a yoke of iron. Let us accept the sufferings and allow them to melt and mold our hearts.
10 ‚ÄúFor thus says the Lord: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfil to you my promise and bring you back to this place. 11 For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13 You will seek me and find me; when you seek me with all your heart, 14 I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile. Jer 29:10-14
Many times this verse is misused to mean that God will give us great earthly fortunes and prosper us, this may be the case sometimes. But we should not focus on earthly riches and abundance our focus should be on our spiritual life. The only way to be satisfied is to be in love with Jesus, connected to the Vine we will receive all the necessary nutrients. We need not worry about tomorrow or the earthly things ‚Äì for the Lord feeds the birds of the air and clothes the lilies of the valley. Instead of dreaming of riches we should focus on the Lord and knowing Him more.
When we suffer like the people of Israel, let us remember that God has plans for us, to restore us to himself. We will go home like the Israelites, even though sin has held us captive, as were repent the Lord will deliver us and prosper us. Once we come into a state of spiritual wholeness, we won‚Äôt even bother about the other things that much. We will also receive an abundance of earthly riches because we will know how to use them properly and not be attached to them.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
