### Day #244 Abusers prey on the innocent and don’t hesitate to misuse authority for their own gain

Abuse is a really sensitive topic to discuss, even talking about abuse can cause grief to some of those who were abused. Unfortunately, there are not enough of Daniels in this world today, who can stand up for the innocent and bring justice. Susanna was very beautiful and righteous; her parents did a good job bringing her up. She is now married to a really nice person who is the most honored of all Jews in the town, he owed a beautiful garden which the Judges used to hear the people’s cases. This is such a lovely setting and there is so much harmony in the lives of Susanna and her husband. However, two of the Judges started lusting over her and they plotted to fulfill their lust when she come into the garden to take a bath (she would come in once everyone left). The two elders hid in the bushes and when her maids left, they tried to seduce her.
19 When the maids had gone out, the two elders got up and ran to her. 20 They said, “Look, the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us. We are burning with desire for you; so give your consent, and lie with us. 21 If you refuse, we will testify against you that a young man was with you, and this was why you sent your maids away.”
22 Susanna groaned and said, “I am completely trapped. For if I do this, it will mean death for me; if I do not, I cannot escape your hands. 23 I choose not to do it; I will fall into your hands, rather than sin in the sight of the Lord.”
24 Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and the two elders shouted against her. 25 And one of them ran and opened the garden doors. 26 When the people in the house heard the shouting in the garden, they rushed in at the side door to see what had happened to her. 27 And when the elders told their story, the servants felt very much ashamed, for nothing like this had ever been said about Susanna. Daniel 13: 19-24
Now the elders being Judges were going to pass judgment on her and stone her to death. They were accusing her of this crime she had never committed. She cried out to the Lord in tears for she was innocent of any sin.
44 The Lord heard her cry. 45 Just as she was being led off to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young lad named Daniel, 46 and he shouted with a loud voice, “I want no part in shedding this woman’s blood!”
Daniel Rescues Susanna
47 All the people turned to him and asked, “What is this you are saying?” 48 Taking his stand among them he said, “Are you such fools, O Israelites, as to condemn a daughter of Israel without examination and without learning the facts? 49 Return to court, for these men have given false evidence against her.”
50 So all the people hurried back. And the rest of the elders said to him, “Come, sit among us and inform us, for God has given you the standing of an elder.” 51 Daniel said to them, “Separate them far from each other, and I will examine them.”
52 When they were separated from each other, he summoned one of them and said to him, “You old relic of wicked days, your sins have now come home, which you have committed in the past, 53 pronouncing unjust judgments, condemning the innocent and acquitting the guilty, though the Lord said, ‘You shall not put an innocent and righteous person to death.’ 54 Now then, if you really saw this woman, tell me this: Under what tree did you see them being intimate with each other?” He answered, “Under a mastic tree.” 55 And Daniel said, “Very well! This lie has cost you your head, for the angel of God has received the sentence from God and will immediately cut you in two.”
56 Then, putting him to one side, he ordered them to bring the other. And he said to him, “You offspring of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has beguiled you and lust has perverted your heart. 57 This is how you have been treating the daughters of Israel, and they were intimate with you through fear; but a daughter of Judah would not tolerate your wickedness. 58 Now then, tell me: Under what tree did you catch them being intimate with each other?” He answered, “Under an evergreen oak.” 59 Daniel said to him, “Very well! This lie has cost you also your head, for the angel of God is waiting with his sword to split you in two, so as to destroy you both.”
60 Then the whole assembly raised a great shout and blessed God, who saves those who hope in him. 61 And they took action against the two elders, because out of their own mouths Daniel had convicted them of bearing false witness; they did to them as they had wickedly planned to do to their neighbor. 62 Acting in accordance with the law of Moses, they put them to death. Thus innocent blood was spared that day. Dan 13
Praise God! It’s such an inspiring story that we can read and re-read. In this case, the innocent was saved, but that is not the case most of the time. We see time and again how people in power get away with abuse, it happens in almost all walks of life, politics, sports, the film industry, schools, and even in the church. Just like they say “Crime has no zip code” abuse can happen anywhere even in a family setting, even parents who are supposed to protect the children have abused them. We need more Susannas and Daniels in this world today, we need people who are righteous and brave enough to stand up for the innocent. Let us take a moment to pray for those who have been abused and pray for protection over the innocent of the world.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
