### Day #223 The New Covenant

Even though Israel was the chosen people of God the story does not end there. Everyone is a child of God whether Israelite or Pagan. God reveals this new covenant through the prophet Isaiah. God is making a new covenant with humanity, expanding "all flesh" to be part of his kingdom. A new heaven and a new earth God is making, Jesus will establish this kingdom and this kingdom will never end, and everyone is welcome. The priesthood is now opened up to everyone – not just the tribe of levities.
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says the Lord; so shall your descendants and your name remain. From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the Lord. Is 66: 22,23
This new kingdom will be a kingdom of abundance – an abundance of Mercy, Love, and Peace. This kingdom will be a prosperous Kingdom, flowing like a river and wealth like an overflowing stream. God will comfort us with the new covenant – just as a mother comforts her child.
For thus says the Lord: I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse and be carried on her arm, and dandled on her knees. 13 As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. Is 66:12,13
In this new covenant, we can find endless streams of God’s mercy flowing from Jesus’s side on the cross. We have access to the richest food, which is God Himself – Jesus’ Body and blood. The Holy Spirit has been poured out into our hearts, the living waters which never dry up.
Let us be thankful and rejoice that we are in the new covenant. Thank you, Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### BIAY Day 223 By Cynthia Dsilva

Isaiah 66:18-21
Jesus chose Paul to fulfill this prophecy.  Paul went far and wide to the gentile nations around Israel to preach the Gospel to them and brought many of them into the Church. According to this prophecy, those were the descendants of the scattered tribes.  Paul therefore chose to preach in the Synagogues where he could find the Jews as well as the gentiles who were the mixed descendants of the scattered tribes.

Paul later ordained many of them to serve as priests and deacons/Levites in the Church (Acts 20:28).
