### Day 318 The real Prodigal son

We read the parable of the Lost sheep, where Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes in search of the lost sheep that tried to get away from the flock. We need to know that God is always reaching out to us and willing to come find us no matter how evil or lost we may be.

Just as the woman in the parable of the Lost Coin, God is always searching for us, doing everything (she lights a lamp, sweeps the whole house, and searches until she finds it). We need to be more open to the voice of the Lord and be aware of the different opportunities we are presented to know God.

In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, we read about the younger son who demands his share of the property. According to most customs in the world today and more so back in Jesus times, the property was only received as a gift from the parents after they passed away.
The younger son's demand for the property is highly insulting, subtly suggesting that he wishes his father would hurry up and die. He said ‚ÄúGive me the property that belongs to me‚Äù, first of all, that is a gift and a gift cannot be demanded.

This is similar to what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden, they took for themselves what they wanted. They did not wait for God to give them the gift but wanted to snatch it and become equals to God in wisdom.
I feel that the second son also falls into this category when he wants to demand and take something for himself and for his friends.
All these years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never once disobeyed your orders. Even so, you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Luke 15:29

The words ‚Äúslave‚Äù and ‚Äúorder‚Äù are not words that a son would say. The second son although always with the father has not understood his relationship with the father. He considers himself a slave and not a son.

The younger son went off to a far-off country, away from the father's care but also away from any boundaries, beliefs, or rules of the father. The elder son although physically present with the father, internally separated himself from the father's care and had a broken/misunderstood relationship with the father.

When the younger son squandered all his money on dissolute living and famine hit, he had no choice but to work for a citizen of the far of country, the job any Jew would despise, feeding the swine. As he went far from his father‚Äôs house, he stripped himself of all his spiritual practices and did things that he would have never dreamt of doing.

Most of us have been in this place in our lives, we have wasted all the blessings God has given us, and we do the worst things we can think of - go to that extent that we once never even imagined we would.

But the important part of the story is when the son came to the realization of his identity as the son and this helped him discover who his father was. He says in my father's house even the servants are treated well, he probably remembers all the years of his life, the goodness of his father.

He decides to go back to his father‚Äôs house, repent from his bad ways and be a servant in his father‚Äôs house.

The father was waiting for his son, on the lookout every day. Now it was uncommon to see an elderly Jewish father run to their children, it was usually the other way around as the elders were highly respected. God comes running to us even though we don‚Äôt deserve it, it is true. If we ask why would God who created the world even bother with a sinner like me, we have not understood the heart of God.

When the father sees the son, his poor condition. The souls of his feet must have been worn out due to the long travel barefoot, but more importantly his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù was in bad shape. He had lived a very poor spiritual life which would have caused him to feel like a slave unworthy of the father's love.

The father sees it all, he places sandals on his feet, a ring on his figure and a robe on him. He restores the son back as an heir, the sandals are a symbol of a freeman, the ring symbolizes authority as a son, and the robe symbolizes that his dignity was restored. The prodigal son is now restored back to being the son of the father.
God the Father invites each of us back, we are His children.

To the dismay of everyone, the actual prodigal son is the elder son, who lived with the father all along but did not live as a son. He considered himself a slave and demanded his rights, though he was following the orders of his father.
We may identify with the elder son, we call ourselves Christians but crib about the commandments we are called to follow. We complain about the church teachings and are intolerant to our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We get irritable when we do not get our prayers answered, we are trying to work our way up to heaven "mentality of following his orders" instead of loving his word. We are grudgingly saying ‚ÄúI followed all your orders, you did not give me a calf to celebrate with my friends.‚Äù We are envious of others and so proud that we hate to see someone do better than us, even in church circles.

We are all prodigal sons, some choose to repent and some don‚Äôt. Let us run to the arms of the Father. Who is waiting for us, searching for us, and coming after us like the good Shepherd.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 318 By Sheila

Luke 13:18-19  The Kingdom of God -  Jesus' Power and Presence in the World. It is like a mustard seed, so tiny, so as to be unnoticed. But once it is planted it can take over an entire field, just as it is meant to take over our lives and the lives of all around us. It grows to be a sheltering presence for others.

Luke 14:1, 7-11  Most of the early members of the Church were Jews. Jesus was a Jew but many in Israel did not come to believe that Jesus was the awaited Messiah because He was more than that, more than what was awaited - He was GOD. For those who believe that He is the fullness of the promises, the law and the hopes of all the years of waiting.
Now God in Jesus belongs to every tribe and Nation. But Israel is beloved of God always. They were His First people, His dearest treasure and God's gifts are irrevocable. We must be careful not to let others words influence negatively how we feel and relate to people. Our lives must reveal the Presence of God in Jesus, Crucified and Risen. We must live humbly, truthfully and with respect for all.
