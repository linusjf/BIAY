### The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son

[![The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day318.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uRbeK7f4QKM "The Narrow Gate, Lost Sheep, and Prodigal Son")

### Day 318 The real Prodigal son

We read the parable of the Lost sheep, where Jesus the good shepherd leaves the 99 good sheep and goes in search of the lost sheep that tried to get away from the flock. We need to know that God is always reaching out to us and willing to come find us no matter how evil or lost we may be.

Just as the woman in the parable of the Lost Coin, God is always searching for us, doing everything (she lights a lamp, sweeps the whole house, and searches until she finds it). We need to be more open to the voice of the Lord and be aware of the different opportunities we are presented to know God.

In the Parable of the Prodigal Son, we read about the younger son who demands his share of the property. According to most customs in the world today and more so back in Jesus times, the property was only received as a gift from the parents after they passed away.
The younger son's demand for the property is highly insulting, subtly suggesting that he wishes his father would hurry up and die. He said ‚ÄúGive me the property that belongs to me‚Äù, first of all, that is a gift and a gift cannot be demanded.

This is similar to what Adam and Eve did in the Garden of Eden, they took for themselves what they wanted. They did not wait for God to give them the gift but wanted to snatch it and become equals to God in wisdom.
I feel that the second son also falls into this category when he wants to demand and take something for himself and for his friends.
All these years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never once disobeyed your orders. Even so, you have never even given me a young goat so that I might celebrate with my friends. Luke 15:29

The words ‚Äúslave‚Äù and ‚Äúorder‚Äù are not words that a son would say. The second son although always with the father has not understood his relationship with the father. He considers himself a slave and not a son.

The younger son went off to a far-off country, away from the father's care but also away from any boundaries, beliefs, or rules of the father. The elder son although physically present with the father, internally separated himself from the father's care and had a broken/misunderstood relationship with the father.

When the younger son squandered all his money on dissolute living and famine hit, he had no choice but to work for a citizen of the far of country, the job any Jew would despise, feeding the swine. As he went far from his father‚Äôs house, he stripped himself of all his spiritual practices and did things that he would have never dreamt of doing.

Most of us have been in this place in our lives, we have wasted all the blessings God has given us, and we do the worst things we can think of - go to that extent that we once never even imagined we would.

But the important part of the story is when the son came to the realization of his identity as the son and this helped him discover who his father was. He says in my father's house even the servants are treated well, he probably remembers all the years of his life, the goodness of his father.

He decides to go back to his father‚Äôs house, repent from his bad ways and be a servant in his father‚Äôs house.

The father was waiting for his son, on the lookout every day. Now it was uncommon to see an elderly Jewish father run to their children, it was usually the other way around as the elders were highly respected. God comes running to us even though we don‚Äôt deserve it, it is true. If we ask why would God who created the world even bother with a sinner like me, we have not understood the heart of God.

When the father sees the son, his poor condition. The souls of his feet must have been worn out due to the long travel barefoot, but more importantly his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù was in bad shape. He had lived a very poor spiritual life which would have caused him to feel like a slave unworthy of the father's love.

The father sees it all, he places sandals on his feet, a ring on his figure and a robe on him. He restores the son back as an heir, the sandals are a symbol of a freeman, the ring symbolizes authority as a son, and the robe symbolizes that his dignity was restored. The prodigal son is now restored back to being the son of the father.
God the Father invites each of us back, we are His children.

To the dismay of everyone, the actual prodigal son is the elder son, who lived with the father all along but did not live as a son. He considered himself a slave and demanded his rights, though he was following the orders of his father.
We may identify with the elder son, we call ourselves Christians but crib about the commandments we are called to follow. We complain about the church teachings and are intolerant to our other brothers and sisters in Christ. We get irritable when we do not get our prayers answered, we are trying to work our way up to heaven "mentality of following his orders" instead of loving his word. We are grudgingly saying ‚ÄúI followed all your orders, you did not give me a calf to celebrate with my friends.‚Äù We are envious of others and so proud that we hate to see someone do better than us, even in church circles.

We are all prodigal sons, some choose to repent and some don‚Äôt. Let us run to the arms of the Father. Who is waiting for us, searching for us, and coming after us like the good Shepherd.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 318 By Sheila

Luke 13:18-19  The Kingdom of God -  Jesus' Power and Presence in the World. It is like a mustard seed, so tiny, so as to be unnoticed. But once it is planted it can take over an entire field, just as it is meant to take over our lives and the lives of all around us. It grows to be a sheltering presence for others.

Luke 14:1, 7-11  Most of the early members of the Church were Jews. Jesus was a Jew but many in Israel did not come to believe that Jesus was the awaited Messiah because He was more than that, more than what was awaited - He was GOD. For those who believe that He is the fullness of the promises, the law and the hopes of all the years of waiting.
Now God in Jesus belongs to every tribe and Nation. But Israel is beloved of God always. They were His First people, His dearest treasure and God's gifts are irrevocable. We must be careful not to let others words influence negatively how we feel and relate to people. Our lives must reveal the Presence of God in Jesus, Crucified and Risen. We must live humbly, truthfully and with respect for all.

Luke 13:3
*No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did.*
The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower, all died physical or natural death. But Jesus was talking about spiritual death.

The Galileans and the victims of the Siloam tower tragedy perished physically. But if we don't repent for our sins then we will perish spiritually.

Sometimes bad things may happen to us for reasons we don‚Äôt understand but best known to God, and we may have to suffer for the sins of others.  Therefore, it is always wise to repent and keep our souls sanctified at all times by receiving the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist regularly, so that such misfortunes may not deprive us of our opportunity to be reconciled with God in the event of unexpected death because death can come to us anytime, anywhere.

Luke 13:6-9
The fig tree is a familiar Old Testament symbol for Israel (Jeremiah 24:1‚Äì10). As the fig tree is given one last season to produce fruit before it is cut down, so too Jesus is giving Israel one final opportunity to bear good fruits as evidence of its repentance (Luke 3:8).
It was three years since Jesus started His Ministry and He didn't see any positive changes in most of the people.
We are created by the heavenly Gardner to be producers of good fruit. But like the fig tree, if we don't produce good fruit then our end will be like that of the fig tree.
Jesus is telling us that God is patient with us and gives us plenty of time to repent and start producing good fruit.  Let us make use of that time to get closer to God do His Kingdom work.
A fig tree normally takes 3 years to produce fruits.  Inspite of constant watering and nourishment the fig tree did not produce fruits so the gardener requested for more time.
A repentant sinner is God‚Äôs prize possession therefore God will not give up on anyone who struggles to come back to Him inspite of all the spiritual nourishment, but He will not wait indefinitely.

Luke 13:10-17
Jesus deliberately healed the crippled woman on the Sabbath, not to challenge the  religious authorities of the synagogue, but to show them and everyone else that Sabbath rest was not given to humans to become slaves of the law, but to begin the day with holiness and good works of mercy, because the rest if the week they were busy with their daily duties, caring for their families and earning their living.

In the new Covenant also the Sabbath rest is given to us also for the same reason. Sabbath rest is a reminder for us of our eternal rest with God. Therefore we must spend the day with holiness by worshipping the Lord (Mass) and then focusing on good work for the community so that God can use us to help the less fortunate ones.

The religious authorities didn't see the leading of an animal to the water as work but they saw healing a helpless human as work. They valued animals and ignored the less fortunate humans when in fact they should have given priority to the needs of their less fortunate brothers and sisters and then attended to the animals.

Let us make sure that we don‚Äôt give too much preference to our pets and ignore the humans in need.  Let us give priority to the needs of God‚Äôs children and then attend to our pets.

Luke 14:7-14
Jesus was not giving advise on how and with whom we must socialize.
And sitting at the lowest place is not a trick for getting promoted.\
While Jesus was literally speaking about humility of guests at a feast (Proverbs 25:6‚Äì7), He was also applying the same principle to us (the guests) at the heavenly marriage feast.

When we attend the marriage feast of the Lamb (the Mass) in Church every Sunday, we must approach the Altar, with  humility, not with pride (Sirach 3:17-20).
The Altar on earth represents the Altar in Heaven (the Body of Christ) therefore what we do on earth during worship is what we will be doing in Heaven and there is no place in Heaven for pride.

Jesus was telling the host of the feast that feeding the well-fed people is not as pleasing to God as feeding the less fortunate ones.  In other words, don‚Äôt invite those who can afford to invite you in return.
God gives us success in our material life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones.  By this we practice generosity which is very pleasing to God and our generosity must always be a one-way act.

Let us glorify the Lord by being merciful to the less fortunate ones and releasing them from bondage of poverty and suffering, remembering that we ourselves were once ransomed from bondage of sin by the price of His Blood (1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20).

Our natural human tendency is to always look for our benefits when we give alms or do some good work.  But if we get our reward in this life, then we will not get our reward from God after this life.  Our reward in this life may be in the form of publicity, favours, recognition, praise, etc.

Luke 14:26
*Whoever comes to me and does not hate Father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.*
Jesus is not asking us to despise our family members or create barriers between us and them.\
Jesus is telling us not to get attached to our family members and the pleasures of this life because if we do get attached then He will become secondary in our lives and humans and the pleasures of this life will become primary and that will give Satan the opportunity to start controlling our lives, thereby destroying our souls.
Jesus wants us to detach ourselves from the desires and pleasures of this life and make Him the ruler of our lives so that in whatever we do and say we please Jesus and not humans.

Luke 15:5
*When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices.*
A shepherd keeps the strayed sheep on his shoulder because when a sheep goes astray it is helpless and frightened and therefore it doesn't move on its own even if prodded.
We too are like the sheep when we go away from God and fall into a crisis.

Luke 15:10\
*In just the same way, I tell you, there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents.*
Heaven rejoices when we make a good confession.
Just as there is great rejoicing in Heaven over every repentant sinner, there is also much sorrow in Heaven when a righteous person goes away from God.
Whenever we lose our near and dear ones or something of great value, we are filled with sorrow or grief.\
Through our feelings for the lost things or people on earth, God shows us how He feels for every soul that is lost (goes to Hell).\
Jesus gave His life for us to save us from going to Hell.  Let us, therefore, not be the cause of our Lord‚Äôs grief.

Luke 15:11-32
The Prodigal son left the place of sin and returned to his father's house. He did not buy a house in the foreign land with the intention of going back to that sinful life again during his vacation.
Repenting for our sins for convenience purpose, with the intention of going back to our sinful life, is not true repentance.

The Prodigal son abandoned his father's house, it led him into a sinful life which brought him misery, then he repented and returned and the father welcomed him with great joy.\
All these steps are the process of conversion of a sinner.

The Prodigal son was an image of Israel.
The Israelites had left their home (Canaan) to go to a far-off foreign land (Egypt). They enjoyed life for a while, then they were subject to slavery followed by difficult times in the desert but finally they reached the promised land (Israel) and were happy.
Likewise the Prodigal son is also an image of us.

This parable has a sacramental principle.
Our earthly inheritance is a shadow of our heavenly inheritance (Baptism).
In both cases the inheritance is a gift, not our right.  We don‚Äôt do anything to earn our inheritance.
Like our earthly inheritance, our heavenly inheritance is also handed down to us by our parents, guardians or elders through baptism.  But during our lifetime we separate ourselves from our heavenly Father by blending with the pagan world and committing mortal sins, and thereby squandering our heavenly inheritance.  Thus, we become ritually unclean.  To return to our heavenly Father we must repent and confess our sins.  Thereafter our heavenly Father will renew the broken Covenant (signet ring) when we make atonement for our sins by offering the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ during Mass.

In this parable, Jesus teaches us that our heavenly Father is not looking to condemn us or to find fault with us, but rather is a Merciful Father, who is looking for our return, ready to welcome and embrace us.
Even though we may be unfaithful to Him, God is always faithful to us. Our Father wants us to have the fullness of life in Himself.

The Parable of the Prodigal Son reminds us of the emptiness of leaving God, choosing our own way. The Lord wants to restore to us what is lost.  He is the One who runs to us, looking for the least opening in our hearts, so that He can welcome us back into the family.
Each time that we return to confess our sins and receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation, our Father accepts us back into the fold with more love than we can imagine.
Let us always turn to our Merciful Father, as He offers His love so freely to us.

The younger son was not only feeding the unclean pigs but he also wanted to eat what they were eating,  In the Jewish world, no one could get more lower than where this young man had reached in his sinful life.  But even that son was accepted by the compassionate father when he repented.  The son had, however, repented because he had reached a point of total despair.

However much we may have enjoyed living a sinful or ungodly life when times were good, it is only when we reach that desperate ‚Äúpig pen‚Äù experience that we realize we can be truly happy only in our Father‚Äôs house (the Church).

When we hear this parable, most of us get sentimental and conclude that, inspite of the conflicts, the father and sons united and they lived happily ever after.  But Jesus doesn‚Äôt conclude with a happy ending.  Jesus doesn‚Äôt even tell us what happened in the end.  And the Pharisees didn‚Äôt really get sentimental after hearing this parable.  On the contrary, they were offended (Luke 16:14-15).  Jesus was telling them that their image of God was wrong.

The prodigal younger son already had a fight with the father some months ago and left the house after taking his share.  Upon his return, when the father threw a party in celebration, it gave rise to a new conflict.

Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.

Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.
Like the older brother, we too can go far away from God by obeying the commandments and leading a good and religious life.  And like the younger brother, we too can go far away from God by breaking the commandments and leading an ungodly life.
Whether we are like the older brother or the younger brother we must repent in both cases.

Jesus first told the people the parable of the lost sheep where the shepherd went out and brought it back (Luke 15:3-7).\
Next he told them about the parable of the lost coin where the owner of the house started looking for the coin all over the place until she found it (Luke 15:8-10).\
In this third parable Jesus talks about a rebellious son leaving the father‚Äôs home but nobody went to bring him back.
When the younger brother left his father‚Äôs house, a really good older brother would have assured the father ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry father, I will go and look for my brother and bring him back home even if it costs me my life‚Äù.\
After dividing the property, everything the father owned was now the property of the older son.  So when the father wanted to have a feast the older son had to pay the price for everything including the robe, the ring, the shoes and the feast.  For the younger son everything was free, but to take part in the feast, he had to repent and humble himself.

We, the human race, are like the younger brother, the prodigal son.  We needed an older brother to pay the price for our sins, so that we can take part in the feast (Mass /Eucharistic meal / Communion) with our Father without paying for anything.  But to take part in the feast, we, the younger ones, have to repent and humble ourselves first so that we can be in a state of grace before sharing in the Eucharistic meal / Communion (1 Corinthians 11:27).

The prodigal brother, unfortunately, got a Pharisee for an older brother.  But we are truly blessed because for us there is a true older brother and Jesus paid that price for us at the cost of his life, to protect us from the enemy so that we could come back to the Father‚Äôs House (the Church) and take part in the marriage supper of the Lamb (Communion).
On the Cross, Jesus paid a debt he did not owe, because we owed a debt we could not pay.  If we understood the depth of what Jesus did for us, it would melt us, move us and change our lives completely, and we would be true Christians.

Luke 16:8
*And his master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly;*
The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewd response to the crisis.

*The children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.*
The Steward used material goods to gain friendship but the children of light (God's people) must use spiritual goods (love, peace, prayer, etc.) or sacrifice their material goods to gain friendship.
The Steward also forgave the people what they owed the master, like the priest who forgives the sinners who owe the heavenly Master an infinite debt when they sin.
Similarly, we too must forgive our offenders in order to gain their friendship and erase all enmity.

Luke 16:19-31
Lazarus went to the righteous side of Purgatory / Sheol / Hades, and thereafter to Heaven because he had gone through suffering when he was on the earth, and the rich man went to the unrighteous side of Purgatory, and thereafter to Hell because he had not shared his abundant blessings with Lazarus.\
The rich man had committed the sin of omission.

The rich man had neither murdered Lazarus, nor had he tortured Lazarus in any way. He had not even spoken a harsh word to Lazarus, and yet he was destined for eternal damnation (Hell).

Jesus again reminds us how important it is to be generous with the less fortunate ones.  But this time He tells us how serious it is if we neglect them.

Even if we have fulfilled all our religious obligations faithfully, God is first going to check whether or not we have been merciful towards our neighbor (Matthew 25:41-43).
If there are poor, needy and oppressed people around us, specially in our community, then it only means that we are not doing our duty as Christians.

The rich man symbolizes Israel‚Äôs failure to keep the old Covenant, and to heed the commandments of Moses and the prophets. Like the rich man and Israel, we too will lose our inheritance if we fail to give to the poor and needy.

It is not wrong to be rich.  But it is wrong if we don‚Äôt use our wealth to help the less fortunate ones.
We need to be good stewards of what God has given us while we focus on our holiness.
Sins of omission are as serious as sins of commission.

Separation or exile from God is what causes the people to burn in Hell because they do not possess the sanctifying grace which gives them the power to stand in the presence of God‚Äôs glory which stretches from Heaven to Hell.  Suffering on earth due to sins is only a small demonstration of Hell.

Jesus may have deliberately used the name "Lazarus" for the poor man, but did not name the rich man, because even after Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (John 11:38-44; Luke 16:31), the enemies of Jesus did not want to accept Jesus as the Messiah.  Instead, they were plotting to kill Lazarus because Jesus was becoming more popular after raising Lazarus from the dead (John 12:9-11).
