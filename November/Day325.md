### Day 325 Boldness to proclaim

We can so vividly remember Peter‚Äôs denial. The same person who was even afraid to acknowledge he knew Jesus, is not going to prison for Jesus and does not even care about his life. He accuses the leaders, elders, and scribes of failing to recognize the Messiah. ‚ÄúIf God is for you no one can be against you‚Äù ‚Äì nothing can be done to stop Peter and his companions. Peter and the apostles were not afraid of anything, they knew they were doing God‚Äôs will and nothing was going to stop them not even death.

‚ÄúWhether it is right in the sight of God for us to obey you rather than God, you be the judges.
20It is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.‚Äù Acts 4:19
The warning did not deter Peter and the rest of the early Christian community, this in turn caused them to pray for more boldness to proclaim the good news of the Gospel.
And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and enable your servants to speak your word with all boldness,
30as you stretch forth \[your\] hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the name of your holy servant Jesus.‚Äù
31 As they prayed, the place where they were gathered shook, and they were all filled with the holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. Acts 4:29-31
Let us also be inspired by the early Christian community, so we are able to pray for boldness and proclaim the good news with great conviction and authority.

St Paul‚Äôs letter to the Romans is really beautiful and helps us understand the salvation economics better. We learnt in yesterdays readings that we are not saved by our faith or works alone. We are saved by grace, by Jesus life death and resurrection.
The law entered in so that transgression might increase but, where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more,
21so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What then shall we say? Shall we persist in sin that grace may abound? Of course not!
2How can we who died to sin yet live in it?
Rom 8:5:20-2, 6:1,2
Just because we are saved by grace that does not mean we can continue to sin and let grace do its job. Even though grace overflows when sin increases, that does not mean we can continue to commit sin and expect to be saved. If we do that we can be certain that we won't be saved, because sinning is being united to death. We are to put to death the old self, crucified with Christ. Our sinful body might be done away with that we might no longer be slaves to sin.
If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him‚Äù Rom 6:8
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as \[being\] dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus. Rom 6:11
We need to try our best to fight against the old self in us and to live a new life.
However everyone can attest that as hard as we try we end up committing sin. This was exactly what St Paul was experiencing.

What I do, I do not understand. For I do not do what I want, but I do what I hate.
16Now if I do what I do not want, I concur that the law is good.
17So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
18For I know that good does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. The willing is ready at hand, but doing the good is not.
19For I do not do the good I want, but I do the evil I do not want.
20Now if \[I\] do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.
21So, then, I discover the principle that when I want to do right, evil is at hand.
22For I take delight in the law of God, in my inner self,
23 but I see in my members another principle at war with the law of my mind, taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
24Miserable one that I am! Who will deliver me from this mortal body?
25Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom 7: 15-25

We will struggle with sin and wrestle the old man in our all our lives, even until the last moments. We are called to fight the good fight and run the race till the end. We should strive to live by the Spirit and rest assured that after we have done everything and failed, Jesus will save us by His grace and Mercy. Thanks be to God for Jesus Christ who saves us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
