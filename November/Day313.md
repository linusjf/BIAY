### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in those anxieties which tried your troubled heart at the lost of your dear Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart so full of anguish, obtain for me the virtue of chastity and the gift of knowledge.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the consternation of your heart at meeting Jesus as He carried His cross. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of patience and the gift of fortitude.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

5. The Crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:18-30)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the martyrdom which your generous heart endured in standing near Jesus in His agony. Dear Mother, by your afflicted heart, obtain for me the virtue of temperance and the gift of counsel.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### BIAY Day 313 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 1:24-27
*After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion.*
Why did Elizabeth remain in seclusion when she was the recipient of a miracle and the bearer of such good news?

In the Jewish culture, it was as disgraceful for a woman to be with child in her old age, as it was for a woman to be barren.  According to the Jews, a barren woman was a curse for society, and an old woman with child was looked down upon as a woman of ill repute.  Elizabeth, therefore, had to remain in seclusion so that the negativity would not have any negative emotional effect on her and on the child during the first five months of her pregnancy.

*She said, ‚Äúthe Lord has blessed me at a time when He has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.‚Äù*
These were the same words spoken by Rachel when the Lord blessed her with a child, because she was childless for many years. (Genesis 30:23).

*Six months later, the angel Gabriel was sent down by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph.  The Virgin‚Äôs name was Mary.*\
God sent His angel to ask Mary‚Äôs permission to be the mother of His Son.
We therefore honor Mary because God honored her first.

The first Exodus began when an angel of the Lord appeared to Moses on Mount Horeb and appointed him for the mission (Exodus 3:1-4).

The new Exodus began when Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and appointed her for the mission.

Betrothal involved sharing one cup of wine between the man and woman as a sign of acceptance of each other.
In the modern times the couple exchanges rings.

The fundamental point which is underscored by the virgin birth is that since Jesus doesn‚Äôt have a human father; His father must be looked for outside of the human realm.  His Father is not on earth but in Heaven because His Father is God.

Mary pleased God more than any other women did, and God was so pleased with her, that the new Adam took flesh and bone from her, the new Eve, and she became His immediate blood relative, an unparalleled honor.

In preparing herself more and more for the Savior, God transformed Mary, the Ark of the new Covenant, making her His mother, so that from an ordinary human being, she became His perfect resting place.

God continues to look for sincere and humble hearts preparing themselves for Him to rest in.\
Like Mary, when we carry Jesus in our hearts like a true family member, through our holy and obedient life, we will enable Him to make the world His resting place and thereby His own family.

Let us join our character to Mary‚Äôs so that we can make a perfect resting place in our hearts for her Son.

Luke 1:31-33
*And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus ("Yeshua" in Hebrew).*
During the incarnation, when the angel spoke and Mary gave her acceptance, the Word of God became flesh, and divine life (Jesus) entered a pure vessel (Mary) and thus a human (Mary) had a share in the divine life.

Similarly, the incarnational principle is applied when we receive the Bread of Life (Communion) (John 6:54) in a state of grace (1 Corinthians 11:27-29), after giving our acceptance (Amen) and thereafter we receive divine life (2 Peter 1:4).

*He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.*
Angel Gabriel quoted to Mary from God‚Äôs prophecy to David (2 Samuel 7: 12-16).

The angel had just announced to Mary that her son would be the future King in the Davidic kingdom.  By default, that made Mary (a descendant of David) (Romans 1:3) the future Queen Mother according to the pattern of the Davidic kingdom.

Luke 1:38
*"May it be done to me according to your Word."*
Surrendering our will to God is NOT when we say *"Lord, I will do as you say."*
Surrendering our will to God is when we say, like Mary, *" may it be done to me, Lord, according to Your Will/Word"* and like Jesus *‚Äú may Your will be done, Lord, not mine‚Äù* (Mark 14:32).

Mary understood that she was only a creature and had no power to carry out God's Will with her human abilities. Whatever God wanted to do through her had to be completely in God's control and power because whenever there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, there is strong resistance from the demonic spirit and humans cannot handle the demons without divine assistance.

This means that when God starts using us to carry out His Will we are bound to go through trials, tribulations, persecution and we may even have to give up our life.  The important thing is that through this journey we must ensure that we protect the purity of our soul, and not the safety of our body.

God is Spirit and therefore He prefers to use our bodies to do His Will on earth.  Let us surrender ourselves to His Will completely, like Mary and Jesus, irrespective of the storms we will have to face.  That is when we trust God.

A godly man will not have marital union with a woman unless he marries her with her whole hearted consent.  Angel Gabriel was therefore sent by the Holy Spirit to Mary with a marriage proposal.  When Mary gave her consent the Word of God became flesh in her womb and she became the spouse of the Holy Spirit, who works along with her, for the sanctification of the human race, to unite people to the Body of Christ.

Luke 1:40-41
Mary was already filled with the Holy Spirit when the Body of Christ was in her womb, therefore when she spoke the greeting (shalom) she poured out the Holy Spirit onto Elizabeth and onto the baby in Elizabeth‚Äôs womb.\
This was the time when John was baptized with the Holy Spirit thereby making him the bridegroom‚Äôs friend or ‚Äúbest man‚Äù who would prepare Israel for the coming of the bridegroom.

Jewish marriages always began with an inaugural dance, and John‚Äôs leaping in the womb was the symbolic dance of the ‚Äúbest man‚Äù to inaugurate the marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) in Mary‚Äôs womb.

Similarly, in the infant Church, when Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and Cornelius and his household were eagerly listening to the Word from Peter, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard Peter (Acts 10:44).

When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Spirit is automatically poured out onto those who eagerly hear the Word of God from us.

John was in his mother's womb and could not see Jesus in Mary‚Äôs womb, but John recognized the presence of Jesus through the voice of Mary.  Jesus spoke through His mother‚Äôs voice.

Let us humble ourselves like Mary so that Jesus can use our voices to speak to others and bless them.

Luke 1:42
Through the power of the Holy Spirit Elizabeth declared that Mary was blessed among all women.

Elizabeth represents all of those who pray the ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù prayer.  When we say the prayer, Mary visits us, to help us during our difficult times, just as she did with Elizabeth.

Luke 1:43
It wasn't Elizabeth, but the Holy Spirit, who addressed Mary as the ‚ÄúMother of my Lord‚Äù because neither was Elizabeth informed in advance in any way that Mary was with child nor did Mary explain anything to Elizabeth when she entered the house.

Luke 2:1-2\
Emperor Augustus considered himself to be a god and therefore wanted all his subjects to be registered in his kingdom so that he could increase his tax revenue.

But God wants us to be registered with His holy Kingdom (the Church), through baptism, so that we belong to His holy family to be with Him for eternity.

Luke 2:6-7
‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Hebrew means ‚ÄúHouse of Meat‚Äù and Hebrew is the language of the original old Testament books.

During the old Covenant Passover celebration, the congregation had to consume the meat of an earthly lamb.
This was a foreshadow of the Passover of the new Covenant.

‚ÄúBayth Lehem‚Äù in Greek means ‚ÄúHouse of Bread‚Äù and Greek is the language of the original new Testament books.

During the new Covenant Passover celebration (the Mass), the congregation has to consume the consecrated unleavened bread (Communion) which is the living mystical Body of the Lamb of God (Luke 22:19; John 6:54).

All this happened according to God‚Äôs plan.\
This is how God announced to the world that the Bread of Life (Jesus) was delivered at the House of Bread (Bethlehem) and was already served in the food box (manger) for the world to eat so that we can now have eternal life (John 6:54).

And God, therefore, made sure that David himself was born in Bethlehem.

*There was no room for them in the inn.*
There was no room for them in the inn (or guest houses) due to the influx of people who returned to their home town to enroll themselves.  They were therefore rejected by the world.
Rejection by the world can often lead to God‚Äôs greater plan being unveiled.

The inn was a symbol of our hearts.
When our hearts are filled with things of this world we become heartless, selfish and disrespectful and thus there is no room for Jesus in our hearts.

Jesus was born in the stable only because the humble shepherds made room for His mother to bring Him into their home.

Let us ask the mother of Jesus to guide us so that we can humble ourselves to make room in our hearts and she can bring her Son into our homes.

### DAY 313 By Sheila

LUKE. 1:5-25
An Angel appears to Zechariah and assured him of his prayers, his wife would bear a child, a son, to be named John.
When his service time was completed, he returned home to see his wife pregnant. There were litany of Praises to Our Awesome God.
His Power to bring fruitfulness, out of fertility and bring God's Will to fulfillment. God manifest His Might, not just by making the impossible possible but building on them His Great Plan of Salvation.

LUKE. 1:26-38
This speaks of Advent, The Lord Enters. He is the King Of Glory.
God's love for humanity is such that, He became like us. He chose His Son to be born through a Virgin, thus fulfilling the Prophecy that is part of God's Plan to save us. So much so that our human plans would fit his designs.
Like Mary, let us say: Let it be done to me as You have said.
