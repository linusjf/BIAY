### Day 313 A sword will pierce your own soul

When Mary and Joseph took Joseph to be presented at the temple.
Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, ‚ÄúThis child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed 35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed‚Äîand a sword will pierce your own soul too.‚ÄùLuke 2:34 ‚Äì 35

‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì isn‚Äôt exactly what we want to hear as a blessing over our own life. Imagine the life of Mary, a young teenage girl called to be the mother of God. She was pregnant before marriage(By the power of the Holy Spirit). A pregnant woman who had no place to give birth. A young mother who had to flee to Egypt without any time to pack. A mother who had to witness her Son mocked, beaten, crucified, and buried in the tomb.

A life of sorrow but one of victory, because her Son Jesus has conquered the world. She is crowned the queen of heaven and earth. She also experienced many joys. She is also our mother who prays for us and helps us in our struggle and sorrow. She will ensure our souls will reach heaven, safe in her Son‚Äôs hands. Today as we try to understand the prophecy of ‚ÄúA sword will pierce your own soul‚Äù ‚Äì let us meditate on the 7 sorrows of the Blessed Virgin
Mary.

THE SEVEN DOLORS (SORROWS) OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
According to a form approved by Pope Pius VII (1815)
V. O God, come to my assistance; R. O Lord, make haste to help me
V. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. R. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
(The Hail Mary is said after each verse.)

1. The Prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:34-35)
   I grieve for you, O Mary, most sorrowful, in the affliction of your tender heart at the prophecy of the holy and aged Simeon. Dear Mother, by your heart so afflicted, obtain for me the virtue of humility and the gift of the holy fear of God.
   Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

2. The Flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-21)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the anguish of your most affectionate heart during the flight into Egypt and your sojourn there. Dear Mother, by your heart so troubled, obtain for me the virtue of generosity, especially toward the poor, and the gift of piety.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

3. The Loss of Jesus for Three Days (Luke 2:41-50)

   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

4. The Carrying of the Cross (John 19:17)

   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

6. Jesus Taken Down from the Cross (John 19:39-40)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, in the wounding of your compassionate heart, when the side of Jesus was struck by the lance before His Body was removed from the cross. Dear Mother, by your heart thus transfixed, obtain for me the virtue of fraternal charity and the gift of understanding.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.

7. Jesus Laid in the Tomb (John 19:39-42)
   I grieve for you, O Mary most sorrowful, for the pangs that wrenched your most loving heart at the burial of Jesus. Dear Mother, by your heart sunk in the bitterness of desolation, obtain for me the virtue of diligence and the gift of wisdom.
   Hail Mary‚Ä¶.
   Let Us Pray: Let intercession be made for us, we beseech You, O Lord Jesus Christ, now and at the Hour of our death, before the throne of Your mercy, by the Blessed Virgin Mary, Your Mother, whose most holy soul was pierced by a sword of sorrow in the hour of Your bitter Passion. Through You, O Jesus Christ, Savior of the world, Who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns world without end. Amen.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
