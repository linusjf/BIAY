### Day 314 Overcome temptations with prayer and fasting.

At the Baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form and the voice of the Father was heard. “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you, I am well pleased.” As soon as that happened, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasted and was tempted by the devil in every way.
The new Adam is able to withstand the temptations of the devil, as compared to the Adam. It seems like the three temptations were similar to the ones that Adam faced.

1. Good
   If you are the Son of God, command the stones to become a loaf of bread. Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘One does not live by bread alone.’”
   Jesus being fully human(and fully God) was truly in need of food as He had fasted for 40 days. Satan takes a natural good and twists it to confuse us, to make it seem good. Jesus could have done that Miracle just as he made water into wine, but Jesus could see the evil scheme of the devil. Eve and Adam could not resist the offer of the devil to eat the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.

“The woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes” Gen 3:6

We also can fall into the temptation of the lust of the eyes, we could say this is really good we should have it.

2. Power
   Then he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.

6The devil said to him, “I shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I may give it to whomever I wish. All this will be yours, if you worship me.” Jesus said to him in reply, “It is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.’

Satan tempts Jesus with power. Jesus had not yet won the victory on the cross. Satan wanted to give Jesus a short cut around the Passion and agony that he would need to go through. But Jesus resisted for worship is only due to God, no person or object or thing or power deserves our worship.
Eve and Adam could not resist the temptation of power, they were going to get similar power as God or similar knowledge as God.
“God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.” Gen 3:5
We also crave power, we crave to control situations and people. Who does not want their own way in matters. Let us keep it at check and offer all due worship to God, let’s just seek His will.

3. Distrust
   Then he led him to Jerusalem, made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
   10 for it is written:
   ‘He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,’ and:‘With their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.’” 12Jesus said to him in reply, “It also says, ‘You shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test”
   Satan tried to push the buttons of distrust, he was like will not God send his angles when you will fall. So give it a test, try to fall and let’s see if it's true. Did not work, Jesus like the previous times quoted the scripture and confessed His belief.

Our first parents gave into the distrust ‘test’, and gave into doubt.
But the snake said to the woman: “You certainly will not die!

5God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know\* good and evil.” Gen 3:4,5

They were like what is God does not have our best interest in mind? What if God is so selfish that He wants to keep wisdom and power from all, just so that He can rule the world.
Satan will try to sow doubt in your minds, he will bring up a lot of negative thoughts about God. Will God really provide for you? Will he really heal you? Does God really love you, look how terrible you are? Will God really forgive you, you commit this sin over and over again.
We need to fight against these voices and believe the God is Good and loves us beyond our wildest imaginations. What God has for us no eye has seen no ear has heard, for the plans He has for us is for our own good.
Let us fight against temptations of the eyes, flesh and pride but fasting and prayer.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
