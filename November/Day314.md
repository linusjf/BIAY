### My Beloved Son

[![My Beloved Son](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/November/jpgs/Day314.jpg)](https://youtu.be/R2fNUca2HAw "My Beloved Son")

### Day 314 Overcome temptations with prayer and fasting.

At the Baptism of Jesus, the Holy Spirit descended on Him in bodily form and the voice of the Father was heard. ‚ÄúYou are my Son, the Beloved; with you, I am well pleased.‚Äù As soon as that happened, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness where He fasted and was tempted by the devil in every way.
The new Adam is able to withstand the temptations of the devil, as compared to the Adam. It seems like the three temptations were similar to the ones that Adam faced.

1. Good
   If you are the Son of God, command the stones to become a loaf of bread. Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúIt is written, ‚ÄòOne does not live by bread alone.‚Äô‚Äù
   Jesus being fully human(and fully God) was truly in need of food as He had fasted for 40 days. Satan takes a natural good and twists it to confuse us, to make it seem good. Jesus could have done that Miracle just as he made water into wine, but Jesus could see the evil scheme of the devil. Eve and Adam could not resist the offer of the devil to eat the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.

‚ÄúThe woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes‚Äù Gen 3:6

We also can fall into the temptation of the lust of the eyes, we could say this is really good we should have it.

2. Power
   Then he took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a single instant.

6The devil said to him, ‚ÄúI shall give to you all this power and their glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I may give it to whomever I wish. All this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚ÄòYou shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve.‚Äô

Satan tempts Jesus with power. Jesus had not yet won the victory on the cross. Satan wanted to give Jesus a short cut around the Passion and agony that he would need to go through. But Jesus resisted for worship is only due to God, no person or object or thing or power deserves our worship.
Eve and Adam could not resist the temptation of power, they were going to get similar power as God or similar knowledge as God.
‚ÄúGod knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:5
We also crave power, we crave to control situations and people. Who does not want their own way in matters. Let us keep it at check and offer all due worship to God, let‚Äôs just seek His will.

3. Distrust
   Then he led him to Jerusalem, made him stand on the parapet of the temple, and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
   10 for it is written:
   ‚ÄòHe will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,‚Äô and:‚ÄòWith their hands they will support you, lest you dash your foot against a stone.‚Äô‚Äù 12Jesus said to him in reply, ‚ÄúIt also says, ‚ÄòYou shall not put the Lord, your God, to the test‚Äù
   Satan tried to push the buttons of distrust, he was like will not God send his angles when you will fall. So give it a test, try to fall and let‚Äôs see if it's true. Did not work, Jesus like the previous times quoted the scripture and confessed His belief.

Our first parents gave into the distrust ‚Äòtest‚Äô, and gave into doubt.
But the snake said to the woman: ‚ÄúYou certainly will not die!

5God knows well that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, who know\* good and evil.‚Äù Gen 3:4,5

They were like what is God does not have our best interest in mind? What if God is so selfish that He wants to keep wisdom and power from all, just so that He can rule the world.
Satan will try to sow doubt in your minds, he will bring up a lot of negative thoughts about God. Will God really provide for you? Will he really heal you? Does God really love you, look how terrible you are? Will God really forgive you, you commit this sin over and over again.
We need to fight against these voices and believe the God is Good and loves us beyond our wildest imaginations. What God has for us no eye has seen no ear has heard, for the plans He has for us is for our own good.
Let us fight against temptations of the eyes, flesh and pride but fasting and prayer.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 314 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 3:10-14
*What then should we do?*

As John tells us, the most important thing to do is to repent.  We must examine our conscience and correct our errors before repenting.  But it is not sufficient only to repent.  John tells us that we must prove our faith through works of charity, honesty, and social justice.

We can start by sharing with the less fortunate whatever food and clothes that we have in excess (v. 11) because sharing is fundamental to our faith, not only after repentance, but always.\
John tells us that whatever job we do we must do it with honesty (v. 13).\
We must not let greed control us (v. 14).\
Whatever we do we must do it to please God.

One of the prominent marks in today‚Äôs world is the absence of guilt for sins, thus minimizing repentance or almost eliminating it.  Most people feel repentance is old fashioned.  Others make a show of repentance for personal gain.  Yet others may say a robotic ‚Äúsorry‚Äù only when they are caught.  But repentance is more than just saying robotic words or reading prayers of repentance from a book.  Repentance means turning around from our material lives, detaching ourselves from earthly bondage and following Christ with our whole heart.

John tells us to prepare our hearts to welcome the Lord.  He wants us to discard all the obstacles which block us from following Christ.
To prepare the way for the Lord in our hearts we must focus on the fundamentals of our faith which are *‚Äúrepentance, sharing and serving.‚Äù*

Luke 3:21-22
*The Baptism of Jesus.*
Jesus was not baptized because He was lacking in anything.
The baptism of Jesus was the inauguration of our baptism for the restoration of divine life within us.

Original sin is the loss of divine life within us, which gives us sanctifying grace to perfect our souls and enables us to enter Heaven and stand in the presence of God.

When Jesus was baptised the Holy Spirit descended on the Son in the presence of the Father.

Likewise, when we are baptized we receive the life of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit (divine life) within us. And whenever we destroy this divine life with our sins we can have it restored by receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) in a state of grace (Sacrament of Reconciliation / Confession), because we are baptized.

The old Covenant people did not have this privilege because their baptism was symbolic, not sacramental.

Luke 3:23
Like Matthew, Luke also focuses on the royal lineage of Jesus.
Matthew shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Solomon through Jacob, but Luke shows Joseph to have descended from David‚Äôs son Nathan through Heli.

How could this be possible?

The Levirate law allowed a woman to marry a brother of her ex-husband (in the case of divorce), or the brother of her deceased husband (in the case of widowhood), even if, in both cases, the men already had children.  However, if the men, in both cases, did not have a brother or if the brother refused to marry her, then the woman was allowed to marry the next of kin of her previous husband, as in the case of Ruth and Boaz (Ruth 4:13).

Joseph had a natural father (Jacob) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Solomon, and a legal father (Heli) who was a descendant of David‚Äôs son Nathan.

How could Jacob and his brother Heli have two different fathers?

Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha first married Matthan (a descendant of Solomon) and they became the parents of Jacob.

After the death of Matthan Joseph‚Äôs grandmother Estha then married Melchi (a descendant of Nathan, but of the same tribe) and they became the parents of Heli.

Heli married Joseph‚Äôs mother but he died without leaving any children.

Thereafter his brother Jacob married Joseph's mother and they became the parents of Joseph.

In short:
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the natural line were David > Solomon >>>> Matthan > Jacob.
Joseph‚Äôs ancestors in the legal line were David > Nathan >>>> Melchi > Heli.

It was important to protect the genealogical line of the Messiah because in order to be the Messiah, he had to be the prophetic ‚ÄúLion of the Tribe of Judah‚Äù (Genesis 49:10) and the ‚Äúroot of David‚Äù (2 Samuel 7:13-14;  (Revelation 5:5).

This is the main reason (among others) for the careful inclusions of the genealogies in both the Old and New Covenants.
It stresses the fact that the existence of these genealogies are not the result of human effort or holiness; they are wholly dependent upon the power of God that guarantees them.

Therefore, inspite of Satan‚Äôs efforts through the rebellion of all the ungrateful humans, God has still kept His promise of a Savior for the world from the line of Seth through Judah to Jesus.

Luke 4:1-12
Jesus shows us that if we live in obedience to God and keep ourselves in touch with the scriptures regularly, it is possible to overcome the devil in the wilderness of this world because God will be with us to remind us which scripture we can apply to a particular situation.

God allows the devil to tempt us so that we can fight the devil and be victorious in the spiritual battle, and it is the Holy Spirit who helps us overcome these temptations if we live in obedience to God.

A soldier cannot fight to defend his country and win a battle when the enemy attacks, if he sits comfortably in the barracks all day and night and entertains himself.

Temptation to follow the devil's ways can come in the form of rebellious children, difficult spouse, nagging in-laws, troublesome neighbours, drinking excess alcohol, avoiding/skipping Sunday Mass or daily prayers, etc.  How we respond to the temptation will determine whether we have passed or failed God's test.  If we find ourselves failing the test we need to start working on improving ourselves.

Jesus could have told the devil to go away but He did not because that would not be a good model for humans.  Due to the weakness of our souls we cannot beat the tricky and deceptive forces of evil on our own.  Jesus quoted scripture to overcome the devil to show us that we too must follow the same.

Luke 4:3 & 9
*Then the devil came and said to him, ‚ÄúIf you are the Son of God, ........*

Satan didn't say "if you are the prophet, priest or king......."
Satan was directly attacking the family relation between Jesus and His heavenly Father by challenging Jesus to defy His Father.

Satan tried the same trick with Adam and Eve by asking them, "did God say.......?"\
He twisted the Word of God, poisoned their minds against God their Father and succeeded in making them challenge God by disobeying Him.

Similarly, since all baptized people are the children of God, Satan will always try in many ways to tempt us with power, wealth, possessions, comfort, entertainment, etc. and by twisting the Word of God, to separate us from our heavenly Father.

Let us always be alert to the devil's tricks by reading the Word of God every day, daily prayers, obeying God's commandments in our daily lives, and regular reception of the Sacraments (Confession and Communion).

Humans are created in the image and likeness of God therefore family and human identity has been the devil's target.

Adam and Eve's minds were poisoned against God who created them.

In today‚Äôs world, divorces are increasing and young children are being brainwashed into believing that they can choose to belong to any gender they wish, if they are not happy with their gender.

Luke 4:3-12
Jesus began His public ministry with both prayer and fasting. This is a good formula for us in our lives.

Before we take any action, we should start with prayer, asking for God‚Äôs guidance and His Will in our lives.

Fasting is also beneficial for each one of us. When unchecked, our passions begin to rule us. However, by fasting and self-denial, we are reminding our passions of who is the boss. We then become more free to direct our lives towards what is truly good, and free to follow the good Lord more closely.

Luke 4:6
*"All these kingdoms have been handed over to me, and all this will be yours, if you worship me.‚Äù*
When the world was created, it belonged to Jesus in its sanctified form and it was handed over to Adam to rule over it.  But when Adam made a Covenant with Satan by disobeying God and eating the forbidden fruit, Adam automatically transferred his dominion to Satan, and thus Satan became the ruler of this world (John 12:31; 14:30), which is why the power of evil was greater than the power of good, in the old Covenant.  We, the baptized ones, are now God's people living in an enemy occupied territory (the world).

Satan was telling Jesus that Jesus would get back all what initially belonged to Him, only if Jesus worshipped Satan.

Jesus didn't need Satan to hand the kingdoms of the world over to Him.  By His holy life, death and resurrection, Jesus gave us access to the fruit of life (the consecrated bread / Eucharist) and thus got us back the authority to rule over God's kingdom on earth (the Church) which Satan is trying to corrupt and destroy, internally and externally, just as he deceived Adam and Eve into destroying the sanctified world.

Luke 4:13
Although Jesus passed every test, Satan was not done with Jesus.  Satan was alert 24x7x12 waiting for a chance to trap Jesus again.  Throughout the ministry of Jesus we see Satan using the people around Jesus to overpower or destroy Jesus by their accusations, attempts to attack, tricky questions, etc.

When we have defeated the devil once, we cannot remain off-guard thinking that he will not attack us again.  Satan has a million ways of tricking people.  Whatever we are focused on, Satan will use that to lead us away from God, smoothly, without us having the slightest doubt that we are on the wrong path.  That is where our daily communication with God through prayers and reading the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes, will help us.

Let us stay alert to sin, pray every day for divine assistance and ensure that we read the Bible through God‚Äôs eyes

Luke 5:3
The crowds represent the flock of Christ and the boat represents the Church, the Ark of God.\
Jesus still speaks to His flock (the faithful Christians) from Simon's boat (the Church).

Luke 5:4
If we have tried sharing the Word of God with others, or doing other works for God, and failed in our mission, the Lord maybe just training us and preparing us to venture further into difficult areas.  Let us move ahead without hesitation because THE LORD WANTS US TO DO IT.

Luke 5:6
When we venture further into difficult areas in obedience to the Lord, inspite of our failures, the Lord will bless our efforts with so much abundance that we may not be able to handle it on our own and we may need assistance from our family, friends, relatives, colleagues, or anyone else.
