### DAY 319 By Sheila

Luke 17: 11-19  The Word of God warns leaders of the World that they will be judged, not as individuals but for all the effects of their collective actions/decisions in the World. God judgments will be swift and terrible in those whose choices disobeyed the Laws of God and disregarded the care of the people and the lives of all.
Jesus heals ten lepers, all of them, all of us in our Church, Communities. He commands that we do what is necessary according to the Law, so that we can live in Society and contribute to it. But only one give thanks, only one acknowledges Jesus' Power and Goodness and Blessed God. And this person was not even a believer. Does God look at all of us (the other nine) and says, "Where Are You? "

Luke 18: 1-8    God's Word has bounded down from the Heavens in the stillness of Night and this Word is a sharp sword that brings death and new life, either decreeing freedom and life and awe before God, or death for those who stand against God's Will.
This is what happened at the Red Sea and we believe, this has happened in The Word become flesh among us in Jesus, the Lord.
We are to pray and reflect upon the Word of the Lord and let it transform us and call us to account in our own lives.
It has been so since the beginning. Would Our God find us faithful or would He find us with the unjust of the World, only occasionally doing justice because we are afraid of Orphans, Widows and the Word of God?.

#### Day 319 Religion is not just a bunch of rules

We sometimes find ourselves in a place where we have lost the true essence of our Christian life and are just trying to follow rules. Sometimes we even just go to Church so that others may think we are good. We probably have forgotten our first love for the Lord. If we feel that way then we need to renew our calling to follow Jesus.

In the Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector when they went up to the temple area to pray, the Pharisee lists out all the ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù he did for the Lord, he fasts and pays tithes and he even goes on to condemn others by saying I am not like the rest of humanity ‚Äì greedy, dishonest, adulterous or like the tax collectors. His words and actions tell us that he is self-righteous and proud, remember Pride is the deadliest sin because it tries to make us one like God.(Adam and Eve wanted to be equal with God).

We see a tax collector also come up to pray, now the tax collectors were known public sinners because they were Jews who decided to work for Rome. Tax collectors were considered traitors because their role was to extort the Jews - their own people for taxes. The taxes were so high that they put many Jews into a state of poverty. Jesus sets the tax collector as a good example as compared to the Pharisee, not because of his deeds but because of the state of his heart.

But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‚ÄòO God, be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äô
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.Luke 18:13-14

The Rich official that came to Jesus claimed that he followed all the commandments from his youth, Jesus loved him and asked him for more.
When Jesus heard this he said to him, ‚ÄúThere is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.‚Äù
But when he heard this he became quite sad, for he was very rich. Luke 18: 22-23

Our Spiritual life cannot be limited to following certain rules and doing certain good deeds. We are called to a relationship with Jesus, we are called to store up riches in heaven. We cannot separate relationship and deeds, just doing good works of charity won‚Äôt get you to heaven. Heaven does not consist of good people, but of saints. Most saints are sinners who at some point in their life discovered the call to a relationship with God and then focused only on that, all good deeds are a byproduct of being in a loving relationship with God.

‚ÄúAll saints had a past and all sinners have a future.‚Äù

The young man went away sad because he preferred to hold onto his earthly riches rather than follow Jesus.

On the contrary, we see Zacchaeus the Tax collector climb up the sycamore tree to encounter Jesus. Jesus noticed that fire in his heart to be good and even went to his house. Once anyone welcomes Jesus into their house/heart the chains are broken and one is set free.
But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúBehold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù
And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.‚Äù Luke 19: 8-10

Zaachaeus being a chief tax collector must have had to literally give away all his property because most of the money earned would have been by extortion. We see someone who was able to part with their earthly possessions to gain riches in heaven.

Jesus came for the lost and sick people in the world.

Let us not just be a rule-following, self-righteous bunch that try to work our way through goodness, but let us give it all for the sake of the Kingdom. Store up riches in heaven and more importantly listen to his voice and follow Him.
If you hear God‚Äôs call today harden not your heart.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 319 By Cynthia Dsilva

Luke 17:7-10
It is the same in the spiritual world.
However obedient we have been to God‚Äôs Commandments, we are still sinners or humans with damaged souls (lack of sanctifying grace).  Moreover, with every sin we commit, we incur an infinite debt which we can never pay back to an infinitely loving God for breaking the Covenant.  Therefore we must not expect God to shower us with material gifts or prosperity in this life just because we are obeying His Commandments and doing our Christian duties.

On the other hand, if we have been successful or prosperous in life, it is not because we are obeying God‚Äôs Commandments and doing our Christian duties.  We must not link the two.

This parable was initially meant for the Apostles because they were chosen to carry out God‚Äôs mission by preaching, casting out demons, performing miracles, etc.  In such cases there was a chance that they could get conceited.  But this parable also applies to all God‚Äôs people who are chosen to serve God in various ways.  Sometimes we may secretly expect some reward for doing God‚Äôs work even though we don‚Äôt mention it.  Also, more often than not, we emphasize only on our rights and not on our duties.

We have to remember always that whatever spiritual work we may be doing for the Lord, in the end He is still our Master.  This parable is therefore a reminder for all disciples to be on guard against spiritual pride and to be humble at all times as a servant is expected to be.

If we have been His obedient children and if we are doing our Christian duties, then we will receive our reward in Heaven.  Until then we must continue living our life in holiness and do our Christian duties faithfully without any expectations.

When we are baptized we enter into a Covenant with God.  Just as an Agreement involves some kind of supply or service, in God's Kingdom the Covenant involves only Kingdom service and must continue until death.

Most of the time when we go to Church to attend the marriage supper of the Lamb we just sit and wait to be served.  Jesus tells us that just because we have busied ourselves by doing work outside the Church, it should be no excuse for us to help inside the Church. When we enter the Church, God, our Master, expects us to help with some of the many works required to be done inside the Church also,.

That is kingdom work for which we must neither expect any reward on earth nor must we boast about it, because that is our obligation (1 Corinthians 9:16).

Luke 17:11-19
One leper was a Samaritan (a gentile), and the remaining nine were Jews.\
When the gentile Samaritan was healed, only he came back to thank Jesus.  God‚Äôs people took the miracle for granted and were not grateful for what they received.\
Many of us are like the Jews.  We, the people of God, receive so many blessings in our daily lives but we take them for granted as if it is God‚Äôs obligation to send us those blessings.  We fail to thank God for our daily meals, our jobs, the good health we and our family enjoy, etc. We fail to obey God‚Äôs commandments when times are good, and in times of crisis we not only fail to trust in God but we even hold God responsible for the suffering we go through due to delay in ending the crisis.
Like the Samaritan, let us remember to thank God every day for all the blessings which we receive, and above all, let us always remember to thank God for giving His Son to us in the Sacraments (Confession & Communion) so that we can have divine (supernatural) life as long as we live and forever.
This incident was a type of a mini Mass.
The lepers began by saying, ‚ÄúJesus, Master, have mercy on us!‚Äù
Jesus told them to go and show themselves to the priests.
Then one came back glorifying God.
Then the leper fell on his knees and gave thanks (Eucharistia) to Jesus.
At the end Jesus tells the man to go on his way.

Jews and Samaritans usually never got along with each other. They were enemies.
But since the same disease had struck them The two enemies were united in their misfortune.

When life is smooth, easy going, trouble-free, comfortable, we build walls between ourselves and others in the name of caste, religion, nationality, etc. But when times are bad and we are in the same boat of disaster as others, we automatically destroy the walls which we ourselves had built.
Let us be thankful to God, not only for the blessings which we have received but also for the blessings which others have received. In this way we will be able to destroy our envy and focus our attention on being charitable towards them.

Luke 17:20-21
*‚ÄúThe kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, ‚ÄòLook, here it is!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere it is!‚Äô For, in fact, the kingdom of God is within you.‚Äù*
Where the king is, there his kingdom is.
If Christ is in our hearts then the kingdom of God is within us.  We must not look for signs but busy ourselves in sharing the Gospel and shining our light around us to glorify God.

The kingdom of God is Jesus in the Word, in Spirit and in flesh.
We have a long way to go from where we are today, until we reach the Kingdom of God in Heaven. But the Lord gives Himself to us in the Word (the Bible), in Spirit (through prayers) and in flesh (through the Sacrament) when we are in a state of grace, to give us a full assurance of our faith and the foretaste of the eternal life that awaits us.  In order to reach Heaven we must receive the Kingdom of God completely and we receive all these three forms of Jesus during Mass.

When the Kingdom of God is within us completely we will be filled with the sacrificial love of Christ and we will be able to radiate that love to everyone around us (John 15:9-10).

Luke 17:26-28
In the days of Noah the priorities of humans were feasting, wealth and pleasure.  They didn‚Äôt take eternal life seriously and therefore they were not prepared when the end came.

In the present time it is very clear that we are going backwards to the days of Noah and we have almost reached that stage.

In the days of Noah, those who were left behind in the Ark were saved (1 Peter 3:20) (Matthew 24:37-39).

Similarly, in the present time, those who are left behind in the Ark (the Church), will be saved.  But we can be in the Ark (the Church / the Body of Christ) only if we live our Christian lives faithfully in obedience to all of God‚Äôs commandments.

Luke 17:37
*Then they asked him, ‚ÄúWhere, Lord?‚Äù He said to them, ‚ÄúWhere the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.‚Äù*
Vultures feed on dead flesh. Those who follow Christ will have divine life when Jesus comes to take His flock at the end of time (John 6:54).

Luke 18:1-8
Like the widow, sometimes we too face oppression, opposition, injustice, etc. from godless and pitiless adversaries, but in the midst of all this Jesus wants us to continue praying with persistence and not to lose hope because God will surely send justice when the time is right and deliver us from the evil and unjust people.

Jesus used a godless judge as an analogy for God because that is the way we so often view God the Father as, when we cry to Him day and night for justice and justice is delayed.

We may not say it in so many words but by the negative way we react to our problems it is obvious that we don't really trust that God is a loving Father. We therefore put our trust in finding worldly solutions to our problems because we don't have patience. We accumulate wealth and material goods because we don't trust that God will provide. But God has His own time to answer our prayers. If our prayers are not answered then it means that we are asking for something which is against God's Will. Sometimes God may want to teach us patience and trust while we wait for His answer.

Luke 18:9-14
The Pharisee‚Äôs prayer is almost a parody of the thanksgiving psalms (Psalms 30, 118). Instead of praising God for His mighty works, the Pharisee congratulates himself for his own deeds.
On the other hand, the tax collector stands at a distance, too ashamed even to raise his eyes to God (Ezra 9:6). He prays with a humble and contrite heart (Psalm 51:19). He knows that before God no one is righteous, no one has cause to boast (Roman 3:10; 4:2).

God cannot be bribed (Deuteronomy 10:17). We cannot curry favor with Him or impress Him, even with our good deeds or our faithful observance of religious duties such as tithing and fasting.
If we try to exalt ourselves before the Lord, as the Pharisee does, we will be brought low (Luke 1:52).
This should be a warning for us, not to take pride in our piety, not to slip into the self-righteousness of thinking that we are better than others, that we are ‚Äúnot like the rest of sinful humanity.‚Äù
Let us clothe ourselves with humility (1 Peter 5:5‚Äì6), and recognize that all of us are sinners in need of His mercy (Proverbs 29:33).

Luke 18:22
It is not wrong to be rich but when God blesses us with prosperity and we don‚Äôt share our blessings with the less fortunate ones then God is very displeased.

The young man had faithfully followed all of God‚Äôs commandments but he still couldn't feel the presence of God in his life because there was one commandment he had overlooked.  He was blessed with a lot of wealth but he selfishly kept it for himself.  He did not share it with the less fortunate ones. Therefore he had blocked God from entering his life.  He wanted to surrender himself to God but he was attached to his wealth.

God gives us prosperity in life because He wants us to share our success with the less fortunate ones.  Luxury and comfort are just candy coated poison.

Luke 19:1-10
By declaring that he would return what he earned by cheating, Zacchaeus was actually confessing his sin to Jesus that he had earned his wealth by using sinful methods.
In the old Covenant, the people were commanded to confess their sins to a priest with the appropriate sin offering to make the atonement (Leviticus 5 & 6) and God would forgive them their sins.  But in the case of theft or damage to others, forgiveness was not complete and atonement could not be done until the person did the fitting restitution (Numbers 5:5-7).\
But the old Covenant was only a shadow or preparation for the new Covenant.
Jesus therefore commended Zacchaeus for making the fitting restitution.

Before offering our gifts at the Altar during Mass, we must make restitution with the one from whom we have stolen or to whom we have caused damage in any way (Matthew 5:23-26).  Thereafter we can confess our sins to the priest and receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Eucharist.

In cases where restitution is not possible, we must come to an agreement with the victim on how we can make satisfaction for the damage we have done.
If we are not sure how to make restitution then we can confess our sins to the priest and we will be told what we have to do.  We must follow the prescribed penance obediently.

In any case, restitution or satisfaction can be done only with humans.
When we make a Covenant with Satan (commit a mortal sin) by damaging someone in any way (goods, reputation, peace, happiness, etc.), we automatically break our Covenant with God and thereby offend God severely.  We can never make direct restitution with God.  But, before confessing our sins, when we make restitution with the humans whom we have offended, God will be pleased with our repentance.

When Zacchaeus was robbing his fellow Jews in town, many people hated him, feared him and avoided him because many were going through financial crisis of which Zacchaeus was the cause.  Thus Zacchaeus was creating ripples of badness because God was not in his heart.  His heart was filled with greed.

When Zacchaeus accepted Jesus in his heart and in his home, he was suddenly so filled with love and mercy that he ended up showing mercy to all his victims in the town by returning what he had snatched from them and thus saving them from possible disasters.

Jesus showed mercy to only one man, Zacchaeus, and through Zacchaeus a whole town of miserable victims were saved.  By accepting Jesus in his heart and in his home, Zacchaeus allowed Jesus to use him to create ripples of goodness.

We are all responsible for creating ripples of goodness or badness.
When we release a drop of goodness with our humility, we create ripples of goodness around us.
When we release a drop of badness with our pride, we create ripples of badness around us.
It all depends on what we choose to release.
But we can release ripples of goodness only when God is truly within us.  Thus we will be able to spread love, compassion, generosity, kindness, etc. Without God we only spread anger, hatred, enmity, revenge, greed, selfishness, etc. because when God is not within us we are in the power of the devil.
*Let us therefore make a wise choice in our lives by truly surrendering ourselves to the Lord so that Jesus can use us, just as He used Zacchaeus, to create ripples of goodness around us, wherever we are.  Only then we can say that God‚Äôs kingdom has come down and God‚Äôs Will is being done on earth as it is in Heaven.*

*Let God be our steering wheel and not our spare tyre.*

*The people were not happy that Jesus entered the home of a sinner and they started grumbling.*
When we invite Jesus into our lives and into our homes, the evil one will not be happy.  He will therefore stir up his disciples thereby causing us to receive a lot of negative comments from people around us.  But, like Zacchaeus, let us not be disturbed by people's negative comments.  Let us ignore those comments, pray for those people and continue serving the Lord.

On the other hand, if God has chosen someone known to us for His divine mission, let us not be like those negative people.
Jesus came to heal those who are spiritually sick, not those who are spiritually healthy.

Luke 19:26
*Jesus said, ‚Äúto everyone who has, more will be given and he will grow rich; but from the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.*
When we are baptized, God gives each one of us some talent for the work of His Kingdom on earth (the Church).\
Let us use our talents to do God's work, whether it is singing, writing, teaching, preaching, cooking, sewing, healing, etc.  We can use our talents to help the poor, the sick and the aged people, or to help the Church or to help the people around us.
If we use our God-given talents to do God's work we will be blessed abundantly.
If we bury our God-given talents by using them only for earthly glory we will lose our eternal blessings.
Let us begin with baby steps and God will give us the strength to progress into walking with confidence, and growing in our mission.

Luke 19:41-44
Jesus stood there and wept because He could see the mockery and destruction of His Body (the Temple) that would happen within the next few days, which was the advance destruction and the desecration of the Temple in 70 AD. He could see the loss of life and the atrocities against the sacred.  He could see the siege and fall of Jerusalem.

But Jesus was also weeping for us. He was weeping for the many times we would destroy His Temple (His Body) by living comfortably with our sins.

Luke 19:45-46
*Jesus Cleanses the Temple.*
Jesus was very soon going to celebrate the world‚Äôs greatest and first Day of Atonement and the first Passover of the new Covenant by offering His Body and Blood (physically and sacramentally) for the sins of the whole world. Therefore, the people of God, who make up the Temple of His Body, had to be in a state of grace before the Day of Atonement and the Passover.\
This is the same condition for the new Covenant Temple (the Church).
The old Covenant Temple was a symbol of the Body of Christ.
The wicked vendors were symbols of sin.
If God‚Äôs people are not spiritually clean before the celebration of the new Passover (the Mass), then they cannot take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) because they will bring judgement on themselves.  We must therefore receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation (Confession) and perform the new Day of Atonement ritual (the Penitential Rite) to purge out all the evil from our conscience so that we are in a state of grace before celebrating the new Passover and receiving the Body of Christ (Communion).
