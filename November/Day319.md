### DAY 319 By Sheila

Luke 17: 11-19  The Word of God warns leaders of the World that they will be judged, not as individuals but for all the effects of their collective actions/decisions in the World. God judgments will be swift and terrible in those whose choices disobeyed the Laws of God and disregarded the care of the people and the lives of all.
Jesus heals ten lepers, all of them, all of us in our Church, Communities. He commands that we do what is necessary according to the Law, so that we can live in Society and contribute to it. But only one give thanks, only one acknowledges Jesus' Power and Goodness and Blessed God. And this person was not even a believer. Does God look at all of us (the other nine) and says, "Where Are You? "

Luke 18: 1-8    God's Word has bounded down from the Heavens in the stillness of Night and this Word is a sharp sword that brings death and new life, either decreeing freedom and life and awe before God, or death for those who stand against God's Will.
This is what happened at the Red Sea and we believe, this has happened in The Word become flesh among us in Jesus, the Lord.
We are to pray and reflect upon the Word of the Lord and let it transform us and call us to account in our own lives.
It has been so since the beginning. Would Our God find us faithful or would He find us with the unjust of the World, only occasionally doing justice because we are afraid of Orphans, Widows and the Word of God?.

#### Day 319 Religion is not just a bunch of rules

We sometimes find ourselves in a place where we have lost the true essence of our Christian life and are just trying to follow rules. Sometimes we even just go to Church so that others may think we are good. We probably have forgotten our first love for the Lord. If we feel that way then we need to renew our calling to follow Jesus.

In the Parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector when they went up to the temple area to pray, the Pharisee lists out all the ‚Äúgood deeds‚Äù he did for the Lord, he fasts and pays tithes and he even goes on to condemn others by saying I am not like the rest of humanity ‚Äì greedy, dishonest, adulterous or like the tax collectors. His words and actions tell us that he is self-righteous and proud, remember Pride is the deadliest sin because it tries to make us one like God.(Adam and Eve wanted to be equal with God).

We see a tax collector also come up to pray, now the tax collectors were known public sinners because they were Jews who decided to work for Rome. Tax collectors were considered traitors because their role was to extort the Jews - their own people for taxes. The taxes were so high that they put many Jews into a state of poverty. Jesus sets the tax collector as a good example as compared to the Pharisee, not because of his deeds but because of the state of his heart.

But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, ‚ÄòO God, be merciful to me a sinner.‚Äô
I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.Luke 18:13-14

The Rich official that came to Jesus claimed that he followed all the commandments from his youth, Jesus loved him and asked him for more.
When Jesus heard this he said to him, ‚ÄúThere is still one thing left for you: sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor, and you will have a treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.‚Äù
But when he heard this he became quite sad, for he was very rich. Luke 18: 22-23

Our Spiritual life cannot be limited to following certain rules and doing certain good deeds. We are called to a relationship with Jesus, we are called to store up riches in heaven. We cannot separate relationship and deeds, just doing good works of charity won‚Äôt get you to heaven. Heaven does not consist of good people, but of saints. Most saints are sinners who at some point in their life discovered the call to a relationship with God and then focused only on that, all good deeds are a byproduct of being in a loving relationship with God.

‚ÄúAll saints had a past and all sinners have a future.‚Äù

The young man went away sad because he preferred to hold onto his earthly riches rather than follow Jesus.

On the contrary, we see Zacchaeus the Tax collector climb up the sycamore tree to encounter Jesus. Jesus noticed that fire in his heart to be good and even went to his house. Once anyone welcomes Jesus into their house/heart the chains are broken and one is set free.
But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúBehold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.‚Äù
And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.‚Äù Luke 19: 8-10

Zaachaeus being a chief tax collector must have had to literally give away all his property because most of the money earned would have been by extortion. We see someone who was able to part with their earthly possessions to gain riches in heaven.

Jesus came for the lost and sick people in the world.

Let us not just be a rule-following, self-righteous bunch that try to work our way through goodness, but let us give it all for the sake of the Kingdom. Store up riches in heaven and more importantly listen to his voice and follow Him.
If you hear God‚Äôs call today harden not your heart.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
