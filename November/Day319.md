### DAY 319 By Sheila

Luke 17: 11-19  The Word of God warns leaders of the World that they will be judged, not as individuals but for all the effects of their collective actions/decisions in the World. God judgments will be swift and terrible in those whose choices disobeyed the Laws of God and disregarded the care of the people and the lives of all.
Jesus heals ten lepers, all of them, all of us in our Church, Communities. He commands that we do what is necessary according to the Law, so that we can live in Society and contribute to it. But only one give thanks, only one acknowledges Jesus' Power and Goodness and Blessed God. And this person was not even a believer. Does God look at all of us (the other nine) and says, "Where Are You? "

Luke 18: 1-8    God's Word has bounded down from the Heavens in the stillness of Night and this Word is a sharp sword that brings death and new life, either decreeing freedom and life and awe before God, or death for those who stand against God's Will.
This is what happened at the Red Sea and we believe, this has happened in The Word become flesh among us in Jesus, the Lord.
We are to pray and reflect upon the Word of the Lord and let it transform us and call us to account in our own lives.
It has been so since the beginning. Would Our God find us faithful or would He find us with the unjust of the World, only occasionally doing justice because we are afraid of Orphans, Widows and the Word of God?.
