### Day 317 Do not be anxious about tomorrow.

Most of us are such control freaks when it comes to our lives. We have our schedules booked out months in advance and holidays a year in advance. We know when we would upgrade our next iphone and when we should retire. Although it‚Äôs good to plan it‚Äôs not good to worry about things of the future. We are called to have dependence on God, rather than depending on our abilities and securities.
Dependence on God.

He said to \[his\] disciples, ‚ÄúTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear.
23For life is more than food and the body more than clothing.
24Notice the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more important are you than birds!
25Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span?
26If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you anxious about the rest?
Notice how the flowers grow. They do not toil or spin. But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them.
28If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?
29As for you, do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, and do not worry anymore.
30All the nations of the world seek for these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
31Instead, seek his kingdom, and these other things will be given you besides.
32Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
33Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.
34For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. Luke 12:22-34

I could not help but put the whole test from Luke, as it has been therapeutic each time I read it. Whenever you are stressed about the future and are not sure of what you will eat or drink or stay. Remember that God the Father feeds the birds of the air and the clothes the lilies of the field.

We are called to be rely on God alone and not on our own abilities and strengths. No matter how strong, rich, powerful or famous you may be today, it all can be taken away in a second. We need to remember that everything we have now is only a gift from God, for all good things comes from the Lord. We need not be overly concerned about storing up riches on earth, we should instead focus on storing up riches in heaven. Doing good deeds and living a good life with Jesus at the center. We should be like the 5 wise virgins who stored up extra oil, the good deeds. We should make for us bags that we can carry into heaven, something that cannot be stolen from us, it becomes an inexhaustible treasure.
But what to do when worries and anxieties knock on our door, we should pray. Pray the prayer Jesus taught us, Our Father. Just these words should be good enough to suppress all worries, for if God is our Father there is nothing we shall fear for if God is for us who can be against us. We should pray for our daily bread, and also be fed by the Eucharist every day ‚Äúthe‚Äù daily bread.

Let us know fear or worry, for each of the hairs on our head has been numbered.
Even the hairs of your head have all been counted. Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows. Luke 12:7

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 317 By Sheila

Luke 11:15-26.
Jesus is accused of serving and doing evil by evil's power. Yet all what Jesus does is good. Healing, curing, forgiving, giving people food, hope and good news.
Jesus warns that there will be a day of Judgment for them and we must be careful that we have not become evil ourselves. All is just fine that all is well because we believe in God.
Are we mindful of other's goodness or are we always looking for evil.

Luke 11:27-28.
While Jesus was speaking the Word of God, a woman spoke from the crowd in blessing and in truth. Blessing for the woman who gave birth and nursed You as a child. Jesus refuses, and says, NO. Rather blessed is the one who hears the Word of God and keeps it. This is more important than any blessings, any relationship of human kingship, marriage, family and parents.
He adds, we are given birth in the Word of God and we must make sure that this WORD grows within us.
