### Day 316 Deny yourself and come follow me

Many people come to Jesus for a reason, they either want to be healed or receive a favor. Jesus wants to heal and provide for us but He wants something more, a loving and living relationship. Jesus invites us to this beautiful relationship, like one of a shepherd and the sheep. Jesus calls the 12 and gives them authority to drive out demons and to heal the sick. When they return Jesus does more Miracles like the feeding of the 5000. He later sends out the 72 who are able to heal and deliver people from demon possession. What is more important than doing works for the Lord is knowing the Lord.

That is why Jesus asked His disciples Who do you say I am? To which Peter replied ‚ÄúThe Messiah of God.‚Äù We are called to discover Christ first before we decide to go out and do works for Him.

In discovering Christ we will have our moments of Transfiguration where Jesus will reveal Himself to us so that we will know that our God is the creator of the world, all-powerful, all-knowing and every loving.

Once we realize who calls us and what is our mission, we will be able to deny ourselves daily and pickup our cross and follow Jesus.

Then he said to all, ‚ÄúIf anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
24For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
25What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself?
26Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. Luke 9:23-26

We are called to lose our life, keep our pride by the side, speak about Jesus openly with our friends and family. Take a stand for Jesus in the anti-life culture.

We sometimes like Peter, John and James may want to remain on Spiritual highs, build booths at the transfiguration and not come back to reality. Or like Martha, we may get overly anxious of the worries and cares of the day, that we so forget the Lord. One thing is needed and we should choose that. That is to sit at the feet of Jesus and listen to every word He says.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
