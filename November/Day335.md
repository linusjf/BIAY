### Day 335 Strive for salvation

I feel that zeal for salvation is lacking in our generation, we see people taking great care to secure a job, educate their kids, save for retirement, get promotions, build their bodies, diet etc. We do so much for the earthly life and do very little for the eternal life. Look at any athlete or sports person, they dedicate their whole lives to sport and aim to win a medal. However, everyone will forget about the game or the medal in a few hours. How much more should we prepare for our eternal goal?
Do you not know that the runners in the stadium all run in the race, but only one wins the prize? Run so as to win.

25Every athlete exercises discipline in every way. They do it to win a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
26Thus I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight as if I were shadowboxing.
27No, I drive my body and train it, for fear that, after having preached to others, I myself should be disqualified. 1 Cor 9:24-25

We should take a moment to compare the efforts that we make to secure our earthly life as compared to eternal life. Make a list of all the things you do for spiritual life, Bible in a year, Daily Mass, regular confession, personal prayer, and charity, ‚Ä¶.

Compare it to the list that you have for earthly life, job, learning, savings, diet, exercise‚Ä¶.
Hopefully, you are making more effort for eternal life, striving, running the race, training our spiritual bodies, and depriving our earthly bodies of good things so that our heart, mind and body is focused on the main goal which is eternal life. All these earthly things will be added on. Let us run and win, I‚Äôm sure we all will need God‚Äôs grace to be saved. But that should not stop our striving, it should fuel our striving. The worst case would be if we preach to others and fail to live out our calling.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
