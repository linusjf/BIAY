### Day 322 Restore God’s Kingdom on earth

After Jesus' crucifixion, death, and resurrection Jesus presented Himself many times to the apostles with many proofs. If this was not true, I’m sure none of them would have given up their lives for Jesus.

He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.Acts 1:3

Jesus was preparing the apostles for the biggest mission of their life to go out to the ends of the earth and preach the good news and build up the church. In order for them to be able to do this, Jesus asked them to stay and pray.

While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for “the promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak. for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4

Now Jesus was with them a long time – 40 days and they must have been getting impatient so they asked him “Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”
But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
9When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. Acts 1: 8-9

After Jesus gave them these final instructions He Ascended into heaven. After Jesus Ascended to Heaven, the disciples dedicated their time to prayer, they stayed together in the upper room and prayed. They must have been really scared as the Romans killed their leader and could kill any of them as well. They thought Jesus would restore the kingdom by defeating the Roman Empire, however, that did not happen. Now Jesus even entrusted this big task to the disciples and they probably had big doubts in their mind. They probably had no clue about how the Holy Spirit would empower them and how they would be Jesus’ witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

But they just stuck together and prayed, waiting for the Holy Spirit to empower them.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### BIAY Day 322 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 1:6-8
The Apostles asked Jesus “when” the Kingdom will be restored, and Jesus responded by telling them “how” the Kingdom will be restored.
The Kingdom of God, which was destroyed in the Garden of Eden, will be restored by beginning with evangelisation.

The physical Body of Christ was present in limited space and time in the first century in Israel but the ascended mystical Body of Christ can be present in multiple places at the same time and His Body includes all His flock.
The disciples wanted to know when the good times would come when they would be freed from their enemies and they would see peace in their land.
Like the disciples, sometimes we too ask the same question because we want to be free from our trouble-making enemy (Satan) and enjoy peace in our lives.
But Jesus reminds us that our duty is not to focus on the turmoil or things of this world.  Our duty is to get busy and start evangelizing the world so that Jesus can use us to bring maximum people into His Kingdom and thus bring peace in our lives.

The Kingdom of God would start in Israel but would not be limited to the territory of Israel.  It would spread out to the whole world.
It would be an invisible kingdom made up of invisible souls.

Romans 1:3
Jesus is the Son of God, descended from David according to the flesh.
Jesus redeemed the world by offering His flesh and blood in atonement for our sins, the same flesh and blood which He received from his Mother Mary.

In the Old Covenant, every first born male was pre-destined by his first born status to serve as a common priest, by offering the daily sacrifices to God, and protecting His family from evil, even to the point of death.

Jesus, the first born of Mary by flesh, has fulfilled His duty as our older brother, by becoming the sacrificial priest and protecting His siblings from the enemy (Satan). Therefore, through baptism all Christians, who obey God’s commandments, become the second born of Mary (Revelation 12:17) and thus belong to God's family.\
If Jesus is our older brother then Mary is our Mother, and that is why Jesus gave her to us (His beloved disciples) (John 19:26-27).

If Jesus is our Bridegroom then, by the law, Mary is still our Mother.
In the earthly Davidic kingdom, as the son of Joseph, Jesus was the rightful heir to the earthly throne after the death of Joseph.  Therefore, by the law, Mary was the rightful Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Likewise, in the heavenly Davidic kingdom, since Jesus is our King, Mary becomes our rightful heavenly Queen Mother according to the flesh.

Romans 1:1-7
Paul applies the term “slave” to himself in order to express his undivided allegiance to the Lord of the Church, the Master of all including slaves and masters because “No one can serve two masters” faithfully (Matthew 6:24).

A first century slave was a servant who obeyed the master's instructions 100 % without any argument or excuses.\
A slave did not have the right to pick and choose which instructions of his master he would obey.  He either had to obey the instructions 100% or he had to undergo severe punishment.
A slave did not have the right to voice his/her opinion or suggestion.

It is this aspect of the slave-master relationship, rather than its degrading implications, that Paul emphasizes when he discusses Christian commitment.

Paul wants us to obey God like a slave obeys his master because God knows what is best for us, better than we do, whereas our sinful nature always craves for worldly things to satisfy the desires of our flesh.
According to Paul, faith and fidelity go together. They are inseparable.

Romans 1:7
*Called to be holy.*
Paul often refers to Christians as “the holy ones” or “the saints.”
The Israelite community was called a “holy assembly” because they had been separated for the worship and service of the Lord (Leviticus 11:44; 23:1–44).
The Christian community regarded its members as sanctified by baptism (Romans 6:22; 15:16; 1 Corinthians 6:11; Ephesians 5:26–27).  All Christians are called to holiness (1 Corinthians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:7), that is, they are called to make their lives conform to the gift of baptism which they have already received.
