### Day 332 Restore God‚Äôs Kingdom on earth

After Jesus' crucifixion, death, and resurrection Jesus presented Himself many times to the apostles with many proofs. If this was not true, I‚Äôm sure none of them would have given up their lives for Jesus.

He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after he had suffered, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.Acts 1:3

Jesus was preparing the apostles for the biggest mission of their life to go out to the ends of the earth and preach the good news and build up the church. In order for them to able to do this, Jesus asked them to stay and pray.
While meeting with them, he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for ‚Äúthe promise of the Father about which you have heard me speak. for John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:4

Now Jesus was with them a long time ‚Äì 40 days and they must have been getting impatient so they asked him ‚ÄúLord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?‚Äù
But you will receive power when the holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.‚Äù
9When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him from their sight. Acts 1: 8-9

After Jesus gave them these final instructions He Ascended into heaven. After Jesus Ascended to Heaven, the disciples dedicated their time to prayer, they stayed together in the upper room and prayed. They must have been really scared as the Romans killed their leader and could kill any of them as well. They thought Jesus would restore the kingdom by defeating the Roman Empire, however, that did not happen. Now Jesus even entrusted this big task to the disciples and they probably had big doubts in their mind. They probably had no clue about how the Holy Spirit would empower them and how they would be Jesus‚Äô witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
But they just stuck together and prayed, waiting for the Holy Spirit to empower them.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
