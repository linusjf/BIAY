### Day 332 Do you not know ‚Äì you are the temple of God.

Many people search for God in many places and through many experiences. We can sometimes fail to overlook the dwelling of God in our hearts.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone destroys God‚Äôs temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy. 1 Cor 3:16-17

The Holy Spirit has been poured into our hearts and we are filled with the love of God. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit and God dwells in us. We should not abuse or destroy our bodies because we are God‚Äôs holy temple. Many sins like excessive drinking, eating, smoking, starving and the like are sins against the body which is the temple of God.

Given that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit, we must not fail to recognize that other people‚Äôs bodies are also the temple of the Holy Spirit. This helps us respect other people's bodies, knowing that God dwells in them. This is the reason why we should not verbally or physically abuse anyone, because everyone is a creation of God and they are the temple of the Holy Spirit.

We cannot submit any of our body parts to evil activity as the whole body belongs to Christ.
Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.
13And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness. Rom 6:12-13

Let not sin reign in your bodies but let us use our bodies for the sake of the kingdom. Let us use all the strength that we have to serve the Lord and the serve the poor. We should use our bodies as weapons for righteousness. Dress modestly and give glory to God, let people see us, and glorify the Lord. We are all created beautiful so let us not fail to smile.

" Let the smile on our faces reflect the presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. " - Michael Eltham

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
