### Day 309 Praying for the dead

Judas Maccabeus fought more battles and was victories. In one of the battles some of his men were killed, given that it was the Sabbath they decided to go get the dead after they celebrated the sabbath.

On the following day, since the task had now become urgent, Judas and his companions went to gather up the bodies of the fallen and bury them with their kindred in their ancestral tombs.
40But under the tunic of each of the dead they found amulets sacred to the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. So it was clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.

He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble way, in as much as he had the resurrection in mind;
44for if he were not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
45But if he did this with a view to the splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
46Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be absolved from their sin. 2 maccabees12: 39-40, 43-46

It may seem strange for them to do a collection of money and they offer a sin offering on behalf of the dead. Given that fact that they found the idols of Jamnia on them. In some for the Jewish men had committed idolatry. Why pray for them, Judas could have just declared that they died because of the just punishment and forgotten about them.

Praying for the dead is nothing new that the Catholics came up with, it‚Äôs a practice observed by the Jews. But why should we pray for the dead if they either go to heaven or hell. The only possible reason would be if there is a place of purification called purgatory where people with some minor sins await entry into heaven. Because God is so pure and holy, we would need to be fully purified to feel worthy of His presence. Hence the need for a place called purgatory.

As we recently celebrated All Souls Day, where we would have prayed for the dead in our family. Let us not forget to offer prayers for the souls in purgatory, especially for those souls that need a lot of prayer. Making sacrifices and Offering indulgences for them can speed up their entry into eternal bliss. Let us also teach our children to pray for the souls in purgatory, so when we die someone will pray for us also. üôÇ

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
