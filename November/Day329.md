HAPPY FEAST:
Solemnity of Christ the King!

Here‚Äôs a beautiful reflection about the feast and its relevance to our daily life:

‚ÄúCome then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,
and bring us with your saints to glory everlasting.‚Äù#divinereadings

### Day 329 Gifts of the Spirit are not on sale

A man named Simon used to practice magic in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.

10All of them, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him, saying, ‚ÄúThis man is the ‚ÄòPower of God‚Äô that is called ‚ÄòGreat.‚Äô‚Äù
11They paid attention to him because he had astounded them by his magic for a long time,
12but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike were baptized.
13Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds that were occurring, he was astounded.
14Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
15who went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Spirit,
16for it had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17Then they laid hands on them and they received the holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of the apostles‚Äô hands, he offered them money
19and said, ‚ÄúGive me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit.‚Äù
20But Peter said to him, ‚ÄúMay your money perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.
21You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.

We read about Simon the magician who wanted to receive the Holy Spirit and the gifts for his personal gain. He was ready to buy the gifts so that he could use them as he wished. We cannot buy the Holy Spirit or Salvation or anything spiritual. It is a free gift, although it‚Äôs free it was not cheap, the price was Jesus‚Äô death on the cross. We can never get anything from God by paying money, or just doing charity. We have to remember that we cannot earn God‚Äôs love or Mercy we can only receive it as a free gift from God.

The gifts of the Spirit are to build us up and for the common good of the church not for profit or gain.

Also we cannot say that we will be saved on our own by reading the scriptures and praying in our house, we need the Christian community. Like the Ethiopian eunuch, who was reading the scripture and not understanding it.

‚ÄúHow can I, unless someone instructs me?‚Äù Acts 8: 31

We have great resources in the church that can help us learn about our faith and grow in holiness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 329 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 8:1-3
*That day a severe persecution began against the Church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.  Meanwhile, Saul was trying to destroy the Church by entering house after house, dragging out the believers, both men and women, and handing them over for imprisonment.*

God makes all things work together for good for those who love God, and are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).
The persecution scattered the Christians throughout the countryside and they started preaching the Gospel to the people there.

Consecration into God's family is an obligation to obey God's Word and to spread the Word of God (Matthew 28:19-20).

It is therefore the obligation of every Christian to evangelize the non-Christians or to help other Christians to know more about the faith or to re-evangelize the fallen away Christians, specially those who they are connected with.  But when we become comfortable in our nests and neglect the kingdom work, God may allow a persecution or some calamity in the neighborhood, to drive us out of our comfort zone by force so that we move out and start working for the growth of His kingdom.  God doesn't want us to go on lamenting over our trials and tribulations and even persecutions.  He wants us to take the opportunity and go out and continue our mission with the gifts / talents which He has invested in us.

In the old Covenant, God allowed the 10 tribes to be dispersed like seeds for the same reason as well as for it to be a punishment for their sins (2 Kings 17:22-23).  It was God's Will from the time His people were consecrated that they must obey Him and be a kingdom of priests to spread the Word of God (Exodus 19:5-6).

Acts 8:14-17\
*When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.  When they arrived, they prayed for the believers that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for it had not yet come down upon any of them because they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  Then Peter and John laid hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.*

By laying their hands on the people to receive the Holy Spirit, Peter and John conferred the Sacrament of Confirmation.  Peter and John had to be sent to Samaria to confer this Sacrament because the authority to lay hands on the people, to receive this Sacrament, was given only to the Bishops/Apostles, and Philip was not a Bishop/Apostle; he was a Deacon.

Baptism brings people into the new Covenant and thus makes them children of God‚Äôs family, thereby permitting them to take part in the sacrificial meal (Communion) of the new Passover (Mass), just as circumcision did for the people in the old Covenant (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:43-48).  The Holy Spirit is, however, conferred upon the baptized ones separately; in the case of infant Baptism the Holy Spirit is conferred on the children between the ages of 15 and 17, and in the case of adults it is conferred on them soon after Baptism.  Therefore, Peter and John were sent to Samaria to do the needful soon after the people were baptized.

Through this sacrament the Holy Spirit gives us charismatic grace to assist us in doing Kingdom work for which we have to give an account to God.  When we don‚Äôt take part in any work for God‚Äôs Kingdom, we start creating a brick wall between ourselves and the Holy Spirit.

Acts 8:24
*Simon answered, ‚ÄúPray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.‚Äù*
Simon the magician believed in the power of the Pope.
Simon was afraid when he heard the curse from Peter because by this time he may have heard of what happened to Ananias and Sapphira for grieving the Holy Spirit by lying to Peter, an anointed man of God.

Acts 8:26-38
The eunuch may have been a God-fearing man but because of the Jewish law (Deut. 23:2) he could not become a full member of the Temple (to enter the inner court).
In fulfillment of the old prophecy (Isaiah 56:3-7) the Holy Spirit was beginning to guide the Apostles and their deacons to open the doors of the Church to all people by guiding Deacon Philip to evangelize and baptize the eunuch.  Thus, the eunuch would have been the first Christian to take the Gospel to Ethiopia and talk to others about it.

Acts 8:30-31
*Philip asked, ‚ÄúDo you understand what you are reading?‚Äù The eunuch replied, ‚ÄúHow can I understand unless I have a teacher to teach me?"*
If we try interpreting the Word of God on our own we will end up in a disaster like Adam and Eve.  It is always advisable to learn the Word of God under the guidance of the right teachers, so that we build a family atmosphere, just as we learnt our basic skills from our parents, teachers, elders, etc., during our childhood.

Romans 13:1
When majority of the Christians live in disobedience to God, the world does not get sanctified and therefore God is not glorified.  Jesus commanded us to evangelize the pagan world but when we ignore, neglect or disobey this command the culture becomes corrupt and we get our leaders (religious and political) from this same culture.
But whether we have good government or bad government, we still have to obey them in all things except sin.

Romans 13:12-14
*Let us lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light; let us live honorably as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarreling and jealousy.  Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.*
Voluntary and intentional drunkenness is a mortal sin because it is a voluntary abandonment of the use of reason.  It is an act that belongs to the dark world and, according to Paul, those who are addicted to it will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
"Desires of the flesh" are desires of the fallen nature of our human body due to the damaged nature of our souls.

*Put on the armour of Light.*
An armour is used only when people go into battle to fight the enemy. Paul uses this analogy to remind us that we are constantly fighting a spiritual battle with the devils and demons therefore we need the armour of Christ with us always or else we will never know whether we are in God's camp or in the enemy's camp. The enemy sometimes gets violent but most of the time he succeeds in taking us into his camp smoothly and in a friendly manner.  From the time we are baptized we must live our lives like Jesus did because it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ who lives in us (Galatians 2:20).

We can put on the armour of Light every morning after we wake up by starting the day with prayer and meditation on the life of Christ. While we wake up every morning to the natural light of dawn let us also wake up to the supernatural light of Christ.
