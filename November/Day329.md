HAPPY FEAST:
Solemnity of Christ the King!

Here‚Äôs a beautiful reflection about the feast and its relevance to our daily life:

‚ÄúCome then, Lord, and help your people,
bought with the price of your own blood,
and bring us with your saints to glory everlasting.‚Äù#divinereadings

### Day 329 Gifts of the Spirit are not on sale

A man named Simon used to practice magic in the city and astounded the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.

10All of them, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him, saying, ‚ÄúThis man is the ‚ÄòPower of God‚Äô that is called ‚ÄòGreat.‚Äô‚Äù
11They paid attention to him because he had astounded them by his magic for a long time,
12but once they began to believe Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, men and women alike were baptized.
13Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptized, became devoted to Philip; and when he saw the signs and mighty deeds that were occurring, he was astounded.
14Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,
15who went down and prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Spirit,
16for it had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
17Then they laid hands on them and they received the holy Spirit.
18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was conferred by the laying on of the apostles‚Äô hands, he offered them money
19and said, ‚ÄúGive me this power too, so that anyone upon whom I lay my hands may receive the holy Spirit.‚Äù
20But Peter said to him, ‚ÄúMay your money perish with you, because you thought that you could buy the gift of God with money.
21You have no share or lot in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.

We read about Simon the magician who wanted to receive the Holy Spirit and the gifts for his personal gain. He was ready to buy the gifts so that he could use them as he wished. We cannot buy the Holy Spirit or Salvation or anything spiritual. It is a free gift, although it‚Äôs free it was not cheap, the price was Jesus‚Äô death on the cross. We can never get anything from God by paying money, or just doing charity. We have to remember that we cannot earn God‚Äôs love or Mercy we can only receive it as a free gift from God.

The gifts of the Spirit are to build us up and for the common good of the church not for profit or gain.

Also we cannot say that we will be saved on our own by reading the scriptures and praying in our house, we need the Christian community. Like the Ethiopian eunuch, who was reading the scripture and not understanding it.

‚ÄúHow can I, unless someone instructs me?‚Äù Acts 8: 31

We have great resources in the church that can help us learn about our faith and grow in holiness.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
