### Day 331 Proclaiming God‚Äôs Word is accompanied by signs and wonders.

While St Peter was praying he was instructed in a vision that all meats are clean to eat, as he was trying to interpret the vision, the messengers of the Roman centurion Cornelius invited him to go to visit them. Usually, the Jews did not associate with pagans, but led by the Spirit Peter went up to Caesarea(a place of a lot of pagan worship) and visited Cornelius. Cornelius was earlier visited by an angel who instructed him to invite Peter, Cornelius and the other Jews that were gathered there fell down and wanted to worship Peter.

Peter started to proclaim Jesus Christ to the Romans and they believed his teaching.
While Peter was still speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word.

45The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also,
46for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded,
47‚ÄúCan anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?‚Äù Acts 10:44-47

We see that as God‚Äôs word was proclaimed it was accompanied by the great sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit. They also started praying in tongues and glorifying God. Nothing was hidden anymore, Peter was able to see clearly what he seen in the vision, that God made everything and everyone equal that there is no restrictions for anyone to become Christian. Jews and Gentiles alike both need Jesus to be saved.
We see a similar theme in the letter St Paul wrote to the church in Corinth.

When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the mystery of God, I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
2For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
4and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive (words of) wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
5so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God. 1 Cor 2:1-5

Paul did not convince people with his good education and preaching skills. He proclaimed the mystery of God with signs and wonders with a demonstration of the spirit and power. If our faith is based only on human teaching and wisdom, we may not stand strong when trials and temptations come our way. There should be signs and wonders when the Word of God is proclaimed, there should be lives changed and hearts touched by the presence of the Holy Spirit. If the preaching is only head knowledge then we may not get too far, we have to interiorize it and let is work on our hearts.
For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with the wisdom of human eloquence, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its meaning. 1 Cor 1:18
If we are only preaching with human eloquence then we might just be emptying the cross of its meaning. Let us who are preachers be very careful in listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, who will bring to our mind the correct verse or teaching that we should speak.
Let us not limit the working of the Holy Spirit.

‚ÄúWhat eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart, what God has prepared for those who love him, this God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.‚Äù 1 Cor 2:9,10

The Holy Spirit is our teacher and helper who will guide us to see the great banquet that God has prepared for us in heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
