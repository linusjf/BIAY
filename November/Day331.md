### Day 331 Proclaiming God‚Äôs Word is accompanied by signs and wonders.

While St Peter was praying he was instructed in a vision that all meats are clean to eat, as he was trying to interpret the vision, the messengers of the Roman centurion Cornelius invited him to go to visit them. Usually, the Jews did not associate with pagans, but led by the Spirit Peter went up to Caesarea(a place of a lot of pagan worship) and visited Cornelius. Cornelius was earlier visited by an angel who instructed him to invite Peter, Cornelius and the other Jews that were gathered there fell down and wanted to worship Peter.

Peter started to proclaim Jesus Christ to the Romans and they believed his teaching.
While Peter was still speaking these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word.

45The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also,
46for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded,
47‚ÄúCan anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?‚Äù Acts 10:44-47

We see that as God‚Äôs word was proclaimed it was accompanied by the great sign of the gift of the Holy Spirit. They also started praying in tongues and glorifying God. Nothing was hidden anymore, Peter was able to see clearly what he seen in the vision, that God made everything and everyone equal that there is no restrictions for anyone to become Christian. Jews and Gentiles alike both need Jesus to be saved.
We see a similar theme in the letter St Paul wrote to the church in Corinth.

When I came to you, brothers, proclaiming the mystery of God, I did not come with sublimity of words or of wisdom.
2For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3I came to you in weakness and fear and much trembling,
4and my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive (words of) wisdom, but with a demonstration of spirit and power,
5so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God. 1 Cor 2:1-5

Paul did not convince people with his good education and preaching skills. He proclaimed the mystery of God with signs and wonders with a demonstration of the spirit and power. If our faith is based only on human teaching and wisdom, we may not stand strong when trials and temptations come our way. There should be signs and wonders when the Word of God is proclaimed, there should be lives changed and hearts touched by the presence of the Holy Spirit. If the preaching is only head knowledge then we may not get too far, we have to interiorize it and let is work on our hearts.
For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with the wisdom of human eloquence, so that the cross of Christ might not be emptied of its meaning. 1 Cor 1:18
If we are only preaching with human eloquence then we might just be emptying the cross of its meaning. Let us who are preachers be very careful in listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, who will bring to our mind the correct verse or teaching that we should speak.
Let us not limit the working of the Holy Spirit.

‚ÄúWhat eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart, what God has prepared for those who love him, this God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.‚Äù 1 Cor 2:9,10

The Holy Spirit is our teacher and helper who will guide us to see the great banquet that God has prepared for us in heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 331 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 10:9-28
The dietary laws of clean and unclean animals were given to the Jews as a daily reminder to be followed until the Jews and Gentiles would become one body in Christ. The dietary laws were not meant to purify their souls.\
The Jewish men were God's first born sons because they were chosen to evangelize the world. The Jews were circumcised to belong to God's family.  The gentiles did not belong to God's family because they were not consecrated.  If the gentiles would be baptized, then they would be able to share the Body of Christ (Communion) with the Jewish Christians.\
The dietary laws were therefore a temporary sign only to set the Jews apart from the Gentiles (Mathew 15:17-20; Colossians 2:16-17).

Acts 10:39
*Peter said, ‚ÄúWe are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.‚Äù*
We are the children of the apostolic witnesses. That is why we still gather on the first day of every week (Sunday) to celebrate the feast of the Resurrection, giving thanks to God for ‚ÄúChrist, who is our life‚Äù (Colossians 3:4).

We live in memory of the Apostles‚Äô witness, like them eating and drinking with the risen Lord at the Altar. And we wait in hope for what they told us would come - the day when we too will ‚Äúappear with Him in glory.‚Äù

The apostolic testimony was not restricted only to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of these words and deeds of Jesus was to be made clear to the developing Christian community as the bearer of the Word of salvation (Acts 1:21‚Äì22).

Acts 10:40
*Peter said, ‚ÄúThen God raised him on the third day.‚Äù*
Peter said that God raised Jesus on the third day, but Jesus said that He had the power to take up His life after His death because He had received this command from His Father (John 10:18).

When we consider the human nature of Jesus, his body needed to be raised from the dead by a power outside of itself.  Even a perfect human nature (incorruptible or holy) cannot raise itself from the dead (Acts 13:37).

Therefore, the Spirit of Christ raised the Body of Christ from the dead, the Spirit being divine, because Jesus is fully God as well as fully human.\
That is why Jesus said, "destroy this temple (of His body) and *I will raise it up* on the third day‚Äù (John 2:19).

Since God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit work together in unity, it is fitting to say that ‚ÄúGod raised Jesus from the dead.‚Äù

Acts 10:44-48
*While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word.*
This second Pentecost was the gentile Pentecost.
Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit before they were baptized.  Although in the normal order the Holy Spirit is received after baptism, God can change the order as He wills when a person has strong desire to follow Christ.  In Catholic theology this is known as ‚Äúreceiving the grace of the sacrament through desire.‚Äù\
Therefore, a person can and will, in certain circumstances, often known to God alone, receive the grace of the sacrament of baptism before receiving the actual sacrament, as also in the case of Apollos (Acts 18:24-25).

The response of Cornelius was a sign that grace was efficaciously working in his life even before he was baptized / purified since God freely gives every human the grace to have faith in Christ, to repent and to be baptized (Ephesians 2:8) because God desires that every human should be saved.

1 Corinthians 1:10-17
The Corinthians had created factions in the Church in the name of Paul, Apollos and Cephas (Peter), depending on who baptized them, and they were also quarrelling with each other due to these factions.

Paul wasn‚Äôt called by God to focus on baptism.  Like any other preacher, Paul too was called to preach the Gospel to introduce Christ and the Cross to the people so that they may have faith in Christ.  If the people accepted Christ then they would be baptized but it is more important for the non-believers to first believe in Christ.

Divisions in the Church (the heavenly Jerusalem) existed since the beginning of the Church but that is against what was desired by God.  Jesus prayed that the Church may be one (John 17:11 & 20-21).

Divisions in the Church are a repetition of what happened at Babel.

Division of God‚Äôs Kingdom is the work of the devil who used the pride of the rulers to cause them to disobey God and thereby divide the earthly Jerusalem (Israel) into the northern and southern kingdoms.

The Corinthian congregation was also falling prey to the same trick of the devil.
Let us pray that we do not fall prey to the same trick by following those who create divisions in the Church.

1 Corinthians 1:22
*For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom......*
Most Jews saw the Crucifixion of Jesus as a helpless and weak man dying on the Cross.  Therefore, they were not convinced that Jesus was the Messiah because He didn‚Äôt look like He was capable of leading a nation.
According to the Greeks, Jesus was crucified because He did not have the wisdom to argue His case and defend Himself and the idea of resurrection was not logical because they did not believe in resurrection of the body.

Worldly wisdom is what the people of the world employ to escape suffering and punishment.
Godly wisdom is what the people of God employ to go through suffering and punishment.

1 Corinthians 1:31
*‚ÄúWhoever boasts, should boast in the Lord.‚Äù*
‚ÄúBoasting about ourselves or our achievements‚Äù is a claim that we live and are saved by our own resources.
‚ÄúBoasting in the Lord‚Äù on the other hand, is the acknowledgment that we live only from God and for God.

1 Corinthians 2:4-5
*My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.*
Our faith must be built on the power of Jesus, not on the priests or any spiritual leaders.  They are all human messengers of Christ and therefore likely to fall.
