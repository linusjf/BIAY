### Day 328 Do not conform yourselves to this age

The challenge that most Christians face today was faced back in the early Church. The Roman and Greek ways of life were ones of indulging in earthly pleasure and satisfying the body. St Paul exhorts us to offer up our lives as a sacrifice, pure and holy, and to be transformed by the renewal of the mind so that we do not conform to the ways of the world but instead be able to discern what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.

I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, your spiritual worship.
Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect. Rom 12:1,2

We should love the Bible and the teachings of the church, study it, and internalize it. We will gain strength and support from the Christian community around us. We are many parts yet on body and we should learn from each other and support one another on this journey.

For as in one body we have many parts, and all the parts do not have the same function,
so we, though many, are one body in Christ and individually parts of one another.
Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them: if prophecy, in proportion to the faith;
if ministry, in ministering; if one is a teacher, in teaching;
if one exhorts, in exhortation; if one contributes, in generosity; if one is over others, with diligence; if one does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.Rom 12:4-8

Each of us are different, some are good at teaching, some are good in generosity, and some are good in their acts of mercy. We have so many saints in the church today who have many Charisms and gifts.
We should above all accept and love all people in the Church, even if they may seen differently from us.
Few tips to remember:
Let love be sincere; hate what is evil, hold on to what is good
love one another with mutual affection; anticipate one another in showing honor
Do not grow slack in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
Rejoice in hope,
Endure in affliction
Persevere in prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the holy ones
Exercise hospitality.
Bless those who persecute, bless and do not curse them.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
Have the same regard for one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly; do not be wise in your own estimation.
Do not repay anyone evil for evil; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all.
If possible, on your part, live at peace with all.
Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good.
Roms 9:9-21

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
