### Day 307 Wisdom Preserves Her Followers

Wisdom has been at work in humanity right from creation. In Wisdom 10 we see the history of Israel in the exodus, by reviewing the dealings of Wisdom with the patriarchs. We can rest assured that those who seek wisdom will never be despaired, she will guide them to rest.

ADAM
She preserved the first-formed father of the world
when he alone had been created;
And she raised him up from his fall,
and gave him power to rule all things. Wisdom10:1-2

When our first father Adam fell wisdom guided him to rise up again. Wisdom though Adam and Eve how to continue life even after they failed. May wisdom help us today and tomorrow to rise up again and try to live out our calling as Christians.

CAIN
But when an unrighteous man withdrew from her in his anger,
he perished through his fratricidal wrath. Wisdom 10:3

We also see what happens when we ignore Wisdom, Cain in his anger committed murder. The lesson to learn is we should always listen to wisdom, even when our natural emotions are at work. Listen to the Holy Spirit when we are angry, worries or fearful least we make a big mistake.

NOAH
When on his account the earth was flooded, Wisdom again saved it,
piloting the righteous man on the frailest wood. Wisdom 10:4

Wisdom preserved Noah and his family when the whole earth was destroyed. Wisdom prompted Noah to build a huge Ark when natural thinking would have said Noah was foolish.
ABRAHAM

She, when the nations were sunk in universal wickedness,
knew the righteous man, kept him blameless before God,
and preserved him resolute against pity for his child. 10:5

Wisdom called Abraham to be the father of nations and made him the father of faith. Testing him by giving him a child at a ripe old age and once again asking him to sacrifice Isaac.

LOT

Where as a testimony to its wickedness,
even yet there remain a smoking desert,
Plants bearing fruit that never ripens,
and the tomb of a disbelieving soul, a standing pillar of salt.
Wisdom came to Lot and his wife, Lot agreed to move away from a sinful city and live a holy life, his wife looked back and ignored the calling of wisdom.

JACOB

She, when a righteous man fled from his brother‚Äôs anger,
guided him in right ways,
Showed him the kingdom of God
and gave him knowledge of holy things;
She prospered him in his labors
and made abundant the fruit of his works, Wisdom 10:10

When Jacob got the blessing of Isaac then his brother came after him to kill him. But wisdom guided him on the right path, even prospered him when he was unjustly made to work for his bride.

JOSEPH

She did not abandon a righteous man when he was sold,
but rescued him from sin.
She went down with him into the dungeon,
and did not desert him in his bonds,
Until she brought him the scepter of royalty
and authority over his oppressors,
Proved false those who had defamed him,
and gave him eternal glory. Wisdom 10:13-14
Wisdom did not leave Joseph when his jealous brothers sold him as a slave. Wisdom gave him the gift of interpreting dreams and he rose to the ranks of the Egyptian kingdom. Even when he was thrown in the dungeons because of the false accusation wisdom went down with him. He was able to interpret the king's dreams and execute a plan to save grain for a season of famine. This OT Joseph protected the break like our NT Joseph protected the bread of life.

MOSES

She entered the soul of the Lord‚Äôs servant,
and withstood fearsome kings with signs and wonders; Wisdom 10:16

Wisdom called him out of royal living to go into the wilderness, to lead a people who would not listen to him. Wisdom was with him when he did the miracles and wonders and commanded the Red Sea to part open. Wisdom was also there in his unbelief and helped him believe.
As we read the stories of the early patriarchs, faith fills our hearts and hope arises. We can be sure that wisdom is also with us as wisdom was with the earlier patriarchs, wisdom will come with us in our troubles and difficulties, and that wisdom will guide us and show us the right path. Let us never cease to seek the wisdom of the Lord.
Wisdom leads to a kingdom. Wisdom will preserve us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
