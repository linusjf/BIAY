### Day 324 Saved by grace

One of the big debates that Catholics and some protestants have is Are you saved by faith alone? The Catholic church does not believe we are saved by faith alone, although faith is necessary to be saved. Saved by Faith ‚Äúalone‚Äù is not found in the Bible.
We see Paul explaining how Abraham was not saved by circumcision but by his faith, he was justified, and he was not justified by the works he did. So let‚Äôs get it clear we cannot be saved by faith alone or by works alone. We are saved by grace, the grace that comes from the life death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
We do need faith to believe that we are saved, we also need to have works to prove that we truly have faith, for actions are a result of what we believe. But it‚Äôs not our effort not our faith alone or our works alone that justify us, it‚Äôs the blood of Christ that justifies us.

Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace\* with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have gained access \[by faith\] to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:1,2

We gain access to grace through faith, so faith is needed but is not the end, its not faith alone. It‚Äôs like flying a kite, we use some effort to get but we cannot sustain it forever, we need the wind(grace) to come and fly it. Like this example we need to believe and have faith but faith alone gets us into grace by which we are saved.
We should count our afflictions and trials as a blessing as, it produces endurance, endurance produces character, proven character produces hope and hope does not disappoint us, because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. So sufferings produces love and God is love.

Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance,
4and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope
5and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us. Romans 5: 4-5

We can be assured of God‚Äôs love for us and his saving mercy because he died for us while we were still sinners. We still have a choice to just leave Christ and ignore the price He paid for us on the cross. But he still loves us.
But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

9How much more then, since we are now justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath.
10Indeed, if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, once reconciled, will we be saved by his life. Rom 5: 8-10

We can rest assured of heaven if we have faith, and our faith produces works, but both our faith and works are not enough we need to be saved and Jesus saved us, while we were still sinners He died for us. We are washed by his blood and are redeemed, when we were sinners Jesus died for us how much more now that we are reconciled and are friends of God, we are trying to live a good Christian life, I‚Äôm sure we will be saved by God, by his grace and mercy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

Romans 4:16
Paul referred to Abraham as "our father in faith," not because Abraham started out with deep faith at his first encounter with God, but because over the passage of time (25 years) Abraham‚Äôs faith in God became strong by journeying with God.
Abraham is the first person in the Bible to be described as a prophet (Genesis 20:7) and this is a reminder for us that God‚Äôs prophets and leaders are often far from perfect.   While the Lord delights in using imperfect instruments like us, He‚Äôs never content to stop at our brokenness.  He always has bigger plans for us than we have for ourselves; and He longs to bring us on a journey of ever-deepening trust, just as He did thousands of years ago with Abraham, our father in faith.

Romans 5:12
*Sin came into the world through one man.*

Adam was the head of the family and a type/symbol of Christ and Eve was a type/symbol of the Church.\
Adam was supposed to protect his bride from evil just as Jesus saves His bride (the Church / the Christians) from evil (Ephesians 5:23-27).  Adam had the ultimate authority and therefore, like Jesus (Luke 4:3-12), he should have made the decision to reject Satan‚Äôs offer.  His decision was the final and definitive decision, not only for his family, but, for the entire human family. It was a lofty position given to him by God.  That is why they knew they were naked only after Adam ate the fruit (Genesis 3:7).

When the Adam (man) of the family does not obey God‚Äôs commandments, does not gather his family for daily prayers, does not help his family to stay out of mortal sin, does not ensure that his family attends Mass every Sunday, and supports his bride‚Äôs evil deeds instead of correcting her, then he is inviting the devil into his domestic Eden (home).  Like the first Eve, his bride too will eventually fall into temptation (gossiping, quarrelling, disrespecting others, etc.)  and gradually the entire family will start walking on the wrong path.

Romans 5:13
*‚Ä¶.. for up to the time of the law, sin was in the world, though sin is not accounted when there is no law.*

Before the Law was given, through Moses, sin did exist in the world but the wicked ones could not be held guilty because God had not yet given His law to the people.  Therefore, people followed the natural law and did what they felt was right.

Before the incarnation of Jesus the power of evil was greater than the power of good because Adam and Eve have given damaged souls (without divine life) to all humanity, and therefore majority of the old Covenant people followed the natural law because they found it difficult to lead good lives in the midst of evil.
But from the time of the incarnation, when God touched the earth (the womb of Mary), the world has been divinized and we are able to be peaceful.  When we are baptized we receive the grace and peace of Christ which helps the people of goodwill to move towards God.

Romans 5:15-16
*And the free gift is not like the result of the one person‚Äôs sin. For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation; but the gift, after many sins, brought acquittal.*
The sin of one man (Adam) destroyed his divine life and thereby damaged his soul and brought physical and eternal death (Hell).  The consequence of Adam‚Äôs sin spread to all humanity like a contagious disease.  Therefore, except Jesus and His mother, all humans are born with damaged souls (without divine life), by default, and are therefore subject to physical and eternal death.\
But the gift of eternal life which we receive through the redemption of one man (Jesus) does not spread to humanity as Adam‚Äôs sin did.

We can receive eternal life if we have divine life within us (John 6:54) which is possible only after we enter the Church with faith in Christ, followed by baptism.  Thereafter we must receive the Sacraments of Reconciliation & Eucharist regularly, with faith, follow all the teachings of Christ and obey all God‚Äôs commandments as well as the Law of the Church.

Romans 5:20
*Where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more.*
We tortured the divine Son of God and killed Him because of our sinful nature but Jesus offered the same tortured flesh and dripping Blood to God to save us because He loved us.
On Good Friday, Jesus transformed the greatest evil in human history into the greatest good for all humanity.

God permits evil in order to draw forth some greater good.

The Mosaic law did not have the power to change hearts.  Our hearts can be changed towards God only through the power of the Holy Spirit.  The Mosaic Law was powerful enough to teach but it wasn't powerful enough to save.

Sin comes to us naturally; we struggle to maintain holiness.

The old law could not give the people the power to keep the law.  It could only point out sin. Thus, it increased sin because it made clear what constituted sin.  But, through the sacraments, Jesus gives us the grace to maintain holiness and to be able to live the new law.

There is nothing to prevent human nature being raised up to something greater, even after sin.
Whenever we encounter evil, God will give us the grace to overcome it, if we live in obedience to God's commandments and remain in a state of grace at all times.
