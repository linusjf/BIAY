### Day 333 The resurrection of the body

We sometimes tend to think that only our souls go to heaven, our bodies decay and are gone in the earth. However, scripture and tradition help us understand that we will be resurrected both body and soul.

“The body, however, is not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body;
God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.” 1 Cor 6:13,14

God revealed the resurrection of the dead to his people progressively. Hope in the bodily resurrection of the dead established itself as a consequence intrinsic to faith in God as creator of the whole man, soul and body. CCC 992

St Paul urges us to avoid all sins against the body, especially sexual immorality.

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take Christ’s members and make them the members of a prostitute? Of course not!
16\[Or\] do you not know that anyone who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For “the two,” it says, “will become one flesh.” 1 Cor 6:15-16

We cannot indulge in any form of sexual immorality, whether it be prostitution or even lust of the eyes. When we give into these sins we are uniting ourselves to the evil in the world.
We are called to be united to Christ, one spirit with him.

But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
18Avoid immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:17,18

The one who commits sexual immoral sins, commits these sins against his/her own body. These sins can become very addictive and can weaken the conscience. These sins are mortal sins and can send us to hell if they are not forgiven.

Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Cor 6:9

Let us repent from all of these sins listed above, least we are denied entry into heaven. Let us not take these sins lightly, they are grave sins. We should keep our body holy as we are united with Christ. Our bodies will also be resurrected to heaven so let’s keep our body holy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.
