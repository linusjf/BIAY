### Day 327 The role of a Deacon in the Catholic Church

There are two types of deacons in the Catholic church, transitional deacons and permanent deacons. During the formation of priests, one of the important parts is being a transitional deacon where they spend time at a parish to have first-hand experience of ministry.
The second time type of deacons are permanent deacons, they can be either single or married men who feel the call to serve the church.

At the liturgy, deacons assists the bishop and priests. At the Mass, the deacon proclaims the Gospel, may be invited to preach the homily, and assists at the altar. The deacon may also baptize, witness and bless marriages, preside at the Liturgy of the Hours, and preside at funeral liturgies among many other duties.
The diaconate is not a new ministry but instituted in the early church. We read in the Acts of the Apostles.

At that time, as the number of disciples continued to grow, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
So the Twelve called together the community of the disciples and said, ‚ÄúIt is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve at table.
Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task,
whereas we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.‚Äù

The proposal was acceptable to the whole community, so they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit, also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
Even though the role of the deacons was the serve at tables, Stephen was an exceptional follower of Christ the Bible calls him a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit.

The diaconate was not any volunteer/temporary service but a full time /permanent role that is why we see them having an anointing.

They presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid hands on them. Acts 6:6
The deacons are not just called to do ordinary ministry but can be led by the Spirit to do great service to the church. Stephen was such a good example of going above and beyond one‚Äôs normal duties. We cannot contain the Spirit of God, or put the power of God in a box. The Lord chooses different people to do different works.
Now Stephen, filled with grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people. Acts 6:8

Certain members of the Synagogue come to debate with him and could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke, so they falsely accused before the Sanhedrin, his face was like the face of an angel and when he began to speak such wisdom poured out he was able to put together the salvation history of Israel and spoke with such convictions that they got more and more angry, their hearts were hardened to the Word of God. They decided to stone him to death, but Stephen was so filled with the Spirit that he was able to forgive them even of this sin that cost him his life. He prayed prayers like the ones Jesus‚Äô prayed on the cross.
‚ÄúLord Jesus, receive my spirit.‚Äù

60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he fell asleep. Acts 7:59,60

Thus the first Christina martyr was a deacon, Deacon Stephen. Let us pray for all our dear Deacons in the Church that they be filled with similar grace and zeal for the Kingdom.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 327 By Cynthia Dsilva

Acts 6:1-3
The conflict between the Hellenists and Hebrews led to a restructuring of the community that would better serve the community‚Äôs needs.

The apostles could have stopped proclaiming the Gospel and started attending to the needs of the widows OR they could have continued proclaiming the Gospel and assured the widows of their prayers for a solution.
But when God sends someone to us with a problem He expects us to get up from our comfort zone and help them practically and not just to assure them of spiritual support.  And God doesn't expect us to cancel worship with the excuse of attending to the needy.

The apostles understood this and took action to appoint deacons to attend to the needs of the widows so that the proclamation of the Gospel would continue while the widows would be taken care of.

By allowing problems in the Church, God teaches us how to move forward and how to manage the administration of His Kingdom on earth.  That is why God started His Kingdom with inexperienced people.  Their humility and dedication to serve the Lord would be the channels through which God would cause the growth of His holy Kingdom with His power.  Earthly credentials are of no use when doing God‚Äôs work.

Luke‚Äôs purpose for adding this episode is for introducing Stephen and his martyrdom which is recounted in Acts 7.

Acts 6:5-6
These 7 men were ordained to serve as deacons.  Their duty was to assist the Apostles.  They were not successors of the Apostles.
Their role was similar to the role of the Levites in the Temple.
Successors of the Apostles are called Bishops.

Romans 9:4-5
*They are Israelites, and to them belong the Sonship (adoption), the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.*

Paul has listed all the gifts which God has bestowed on the people of Israel.
This epistle was written by Paul around one or two decades after the Ascension of Jesus.  According to God's plan for salvation, the Gospel was to be preached to the Jews first and then to the gentiles (Romans 1:16).  The Jews were the people chosen to evangelize the other nations, because Israel was God‚Äôs first-born son and it was the duty of the first-born son to carry on the priestly duty of the father.  Even though Paul was called to preach to the gentiles, he always preached to the Jews first because of his concern for his kinsfolk. When the Jews refused to accept the Gospel Paul went to the gentiles.
Paul was therefore expressing sorrow about the fact that many of the Jews had still not accepted Jesus as their Messiah and Saviour, inspite of them being God's beloved people.

Although all humans are God's children in His image, through Adam (Genesis 1:26), *Sonship* is given only to the consecrated people who live and die in a Covenant relation with God because they bear the likeness of God.
When we destroy the divine life within us with a mortal sin, we retain the image of God but not His likeness.

God dwelt on earth in a special way, only with His consecrated people (the Israelites), in the *Glory cloud.*

The *covenants* were made only with Israel through Abraham and his chosen descendants.

The *old law* was given only to Israel.

Although people of other faiths also worship God in their own way, only Israel was trained on how to *worship* God the way He wants us to, that is, with a liturgical celebration, because God would choose some men from Israel and ordain them through the Messiah to perform priestly duties and offer the prescribed sacrifice to God to constantly purify God's people as long as they lived.

The *promises* of a new Covenant, a new creation and a new heart were given only to Israel. The new Covenant was made by Jesus in the Upper Room, the new creation began on the day of the Resurrection, and we receive a new heart when we are baptized.

In the journey of salvation, the *patriarchs* who were chosen from Israel were all part of the golden thread from Adam to the Messiah (Jesus). The greatest gift to mankind, the Messiah Himself, was one of their kinsfolk.

Thus, God showed His love for Israel by preparing them carefully and giving them the entire package for salvation but unfortunately they rejected God's gift.
