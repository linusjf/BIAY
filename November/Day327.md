### Day 327 The role of a Deacon in the Catholic Church.

There are two types of deacons in the Catholic church, transitional deacons and permanent deacons. During the formation of priests, one of the important parts is being a transitional deacon where they spend time at a parish to have first-hand experience of ministry.
The second time type of deacons are permanent deacons, they can be either single or married men who feel the call to serve the church.

At the liturgy, deacons assists the bishop and priests. At the Mass, the deacon proclaims the Gospel, may be invited to preach the homily, and assists at the altar. The deacon may also baptize, witness and bless marriages, preside at the Liturgy of the Hours, and preside at funeral liturgies among many other duties.
The diaconate is not a new ministry but instituted in the early church. We read in the Acts of the Apostles.

At that time, as the number of disciples continued to grow, the Hellenists complained against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
So the Twelve called together the community of the disciples and said, ‚ÄúIt is not right for us to neglect the word of God to serve at table.
Brothers, select from among you seven reputable men, filled with the Spirit and wisdom, whom we shall appoint to this task,
whereas we shall devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.‚Äù

The proposal was acceptable to the whole community, so they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit, also Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
Even though the role of the deacons was the serve at tables, Stephen was an exceptional follower of Christ the Bible calls him a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit.

The diaconate was not any volunteer/temporary service but a full time /permanent role that is why we see them having an anointing.

They presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid hands on them. Acts 6:6
The deacons are not just called to do ordinary ministry but can be led by the Spirit to do great service to the church. Stephen was such a good example of going above and beyond one‚Äôs normal duties. We cannot contain the Spirit of God, or put the power of God in a box. The Lord chooses different people to do different works.
Now Stephen, filled with grace and power, was working great wonders and signs among the people. Acts 6:8

Certain members of the Synagogue come to debate with him and could not withstand the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke, so they falsely accused before the Sanhedrin, his face was like the face of an angel and when he began to speak such wisdom poured out he was able to put together the salvation history of Israel and spoke with such convictions that they got more and more angry, their hearts were hardened to the Word of God. They decided to stone him to death, but Stephen was so filled with the Spirit that he was able to forgive them even of this sin that cost him his life. He prayed prayers like the ones Jesus‚Äô prayed on the cross.
‚ÄúLord Jesus, receive my spirit.‚Äù

60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúLord, do not hold this sin against them‚Äù; and when he said this, he fell asleep. Acts 7:59,60

Thus the first Christina martyr was a deacon, Deacon Stephen. Let us pray for all our dear Deacons in the Church that they be filled with similar grace and zeal for the Kingdom.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
