### Day 321 Where not our heart burning when He spoke to us

Oh how I wished I was Cleopas, he and his wife on the road to Emmaus had the pleasure of a long conversation with the risen Lord. Jesus probably did like a “Bible in a year - in a day” reading the Old Testament and explaining how Jesus is the fulfillment of the old testament promises, how Jesus is the new Adam, Moses, David, Elijah…. I cannot even imagine how uplifted and overwhelmed they must have felt, given how downcast they were feeling after Jesus' death.

Then they said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning \[within us\] while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us?” Luke 24:32

At the end of the journey when they years where opened by Jesus teaching and their hearts on fire, Jesus did something that would blow their socks off – he celebrated the Eucharist with them.

And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them.
31With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their sight. Luke 24:31

In the breaking of the bread, Jesus revealed His true presence and divinity. After they ate this bread their eyes were opened, and they ate the fruit of the new tree of life the cross. Our first parents ate the forbidden fruit and their eyes were closed. We should not be too jealous of Cleopas and his wife as we still have the Eucharist even till this day 2000+ years later. In the Eucharist, the scriptures are read, and they are opened up to us by the priest/deacon. And in the breaking of the bread Jesus’s true presence is felt. “This is my body and this is my blood” When we eat this bread our eyes are opened and we receive life, we receive nourishment, and strength for the journey to heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
