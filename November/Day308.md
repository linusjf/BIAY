### Day 308 Fight for the right fiercely, God’s horseman is ahead of us

Lysias, guardian and kinsman of the king and head of the government gathered eighty thousand infantry and all his cavalry and marched against the Jews.
He did not take God’s power into account at all, but felt exultant confidence in his myriads of foot soldiers, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

5So he invaded Judea, and when he reached Beth-zur, a fortified place about five stadia from Jerusalem, launched a strong attack against it. 6When Maccabeus and his companions learned that Lysias was besieging the strongholds, they and all the people begged the Lord with lamentations and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.7Maccabeus himself was the first to take up arms, and he exhorted the others to join him in risking their lives to help their kindred. Then they resolutely set out together. 2 Maccabees 11:4-8

Judas Maccabeus was the first to take up arms against the strong attack of Lysias and his army.
He even encouraged the others to join him in risking their lives to help the kindred. They resolutely set out together, without fear of losing their own lives against this strong attach.
When they decided to fight for the Lord’s people, a miracle happened -

8Suddenly, while they were still near Jerusalem, a horseman appeared at their head, clothed in white garments and brandishing gold weapons. 2 Macccabees 11:8
Imagine how that helped boost their confidence, it truly did. They were ready to fight this strong enemy but also ready to fight beast or even a iron gate.
Then all of them together thanked the merciful God, and their hearts were filled with such courage that they were ready to assault not only human beings but even the most savage beasts, or even walls of iron.
10Now that the Lord had shown mercy toward them, they advanced in battle order with the aid of their heavenly ally.11Hurling themselves upon the enemy like lions, they laid low eleven thousand foot soldiers and sixteen hundred cavalry, and put all the rest to flight.12Most of those who survived were wounded and disarmed, while Lysias himself escaped only by shameful flight. 2 Maccabees 11:9-12

Let us take courage from this knowing that when we decide to fight our battles, battle for the truth. God’s horseman is already standing ahead of you taking on the enemies. Whether we see the horseman or know – God is present whenever we try to do good. God has already started fighting for us, even before we can. He is placing angels ahead of us opening the way for us.

I will go before you
and level the mountains;
Bronze doors I will shatter,
iron bars I will snap.
I will give you treasures of darkness,
riches hidden away,
That you may know I am the LORD,
the God of Israel, who calls you by name. Is 42:2

Even though the horseman was there fighting that did not deter the Jews from fighting also. In fact that gave them such courage that they fought harder. We also should fight like fierce lions for the good, God is with us and is already fighting for us. God is Making a way, fighting the enemies, crushing the gates and mountains that are in our way.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

Wisdom 12:19
*You taught your people, by these deeds, that those who are righteous must be kind;  And you gave your children reason to hope that you would allow them to repent for their sins.*

God cares for all of us.  Though He is a God of justice, even those who defy and disbelieve Him may hope for His mercy if they turn to Him in repentance.

Though we are believers, we often defy God by committing sins.  Let us therefore turn to Him in repentance so that we may be the recipients of His mercy and not of His judgement.
