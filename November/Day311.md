### Day 311 Helping a troubled heart.

When we see troubled people, we usually either avoid them or try to cheer them on. Some people even go to the extent of betraying or abandoning someone when they are in trouble. This could be really hard on someone who desperately needs support.

The other approach some take is to try to cheer up the troubled person. Buy them a drink or try to divert their minds with something or the other. This does not really help the person in trouble. The proverb in today‚Äôs reading teaches us just that.

A bad tooth or an unsteady foot‚Äî
a trust betrayed in time of trouble.
Like the removal of clothes on a cold day, or vinegar on soda,
is the one who sings to a troubled heart. ‚Äì Proverbs 25:19-20

So what should be the right approach to someone who is in distress?
First thing to be done is to notice a person in trouble, in the parable of the good Smartian the priest and the Levite both did not even notice the person who was robbed and beaten.
But the Samaritan was moved with compassion, he stopped, took care of his wounds and even paid for his stay at an inn.

We should follow the approach of the good Smartian, be attentive to troubled people around us. We should do everything that we can to help out anyone who may be in trouble.
We are called to carry each other‚Äôs burdens.

‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù Gal 6:2

We should always make friends and have each other‚Äôs back.
‚ÄúTwo are better than one because they have a good return for their work; If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up.‚Äù Ecc 4:9-10

How pitiful it would be if you had no one who has your back, no one to pick you up when you fall. It usually would be the case if you did not pick someone up when they needed help. In the world we seem to be getting more and more isolated, we call it independence but I think we are missing out on something great.
We are God‚Äôs hands and God‚Äôs feet in this world. God promised that he would be close to the broken hearted. Let us make it our mission to be God‚Äôs hand and feet to the broken hearted person.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Ps 34:18

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
