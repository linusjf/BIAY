### Day 330 The worst sinners make the best saints.

Saul was a young devout Jew, who witnessed the start of the persecution when Deacon Stephen was Martyred by stoning. Paul consented to the execution of Stephen.
The witnesses laid down their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. Acts 7:58

Now Saul was consenting to his execution. Acts 8:1

Soon after the execution of Stephen on that day, severe persecution caused the church to scatter.
Saul was a zealous Jew and was thinking he was doing God‚Äôs when we went about persecuting the Christians.

Now Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
2and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that, if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way, he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.
3On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.
4He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù
5He said, ‚ÄúWho are you, sir?‚Äù The reply came, ‚ÄúI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
6Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do.‚Äù
7The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, for they heard the voice but could see no one.
8Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.
9For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank. Acts 9:1-9

Saul‚Äôs conversion account is so striking and dramatic that it seems unreal. Even though Saul did not crucify Jesus, Jesus said ‚ÄúSaul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?‚Äù. Later on in his letters, Paul will tell us the Jesus is the head and we are his body. What God started at Damascus will impact the early church and the future church ‚Äì ‚Äúus‚Äù in such a great way. Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles and helped build most of the early church doctrine and letters. The zeal that Saul showed towards his religion was something that Jesus probably admired. Paul would use that same zeal to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ later.

We should not undermine anyone, no matter how evil they may seem. We do not know their full story yet, God is still working on them. In an instance God can change their hearts and their lives can be amended. Let us continue to pray for them with great fervor.

We know the rest of the story, Ananias was instructed in a vision to go and pray over Saul, was initially reluctant because of Saul‚Äôs persecutor image. Nothing stopped Saul from being baptized. After which nothing stopped him from preaching Christ, he was given such great revelation and such great zeal for the kingdom that no one could stop him.
So let us pray for all the Sauls in our lives that they may be converted to Paul. That they see the real calling in their life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
