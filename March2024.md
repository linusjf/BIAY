### Complaining in the Desert

### Day 61: “Complaint of rebellion”

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves – where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us 🙏

### Spies Sent to Canaan

### Day 62: “Family Feud”

JOKE ALERT: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ 😁
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses’ wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it’s important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What’s important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick – the differences disappeared the brothers united – Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### Israel's Rebellion

[![Israel's Rebellion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day063.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0TIAYr9W5pw "Israel's Rebellion")

### Day 63: “Slow to anger and abounding in mercy” ###

The Israelites are a rebellious people, they were delivered from the strongest army – the Egyptians. God almighty the great ‘I AM’ is with them, He delivered them from Egypt – with supernatural events – the plagues, the parting of the Dead Sea, feeding in the desert, and water from the rock. Even though the Lord led them with a mighty hand and an outreached arm, even though the Lord was fighting for them. The Israelites were rebelling over and over again, they were a rebellious people. They even decided to go back to Egypt, they said let us appoint a captain and go back.

Is this not our story, do we not keep drifting away from the Lord. The Lord has done great things in our lives, he has provided us with a good life – and if you can read this today – you are more fortunate than half the people in the world or maybe even more, as they are so poor that they do not have internet access. We should stop complaining and remember all the sins the Lord delivered us from, this will help us realize how unworthy we are. We should not think of backsliding or the temporary pleasure we had when we committed sins in the past.

Even though we are so fickle-minded and rebellious, and we continuously fall back into our old sins. The Lord is patient – He is slow to anger and abounding in mercy.

We cannot mix the old and the new clothes – we cannot carry on with old sins and try to pretend that we are holy. The old has gone and the new has come.

“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old" Luke 5:36

Remember that the Lord is patient and is waiting for us to change, He has not left us even though we are not worthy, even though we keep going back to the old sins. May the Lord strengthen us and liberate us from our sinful past.

Also want to call out that we see some Israelites not listening to instructions, getting impatience, and wanting to take on the Amalekites and Canaanites on their own intuition – they decided to go out on their own strength without taking the Ark of the covenant or without the guidance of the Lord(the pillar smoke and fire) – they FAILED – the Amalekites and Canaanites came down and defeated them.

We have to listen to the Lord and wait on Him, not take things into our own hands. Just follow the instructions the Lord gives us and it will be good with us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏
