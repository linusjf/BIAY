### Complaining in the Desert

### Day 61: “Complaint of rebellion”

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves – where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us 🙏

### Day 62: “Family Feud”

JOKE ALERT: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ 😁
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses’ wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it’s important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What’s important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick – the differences disappeared the brothers united – Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏
