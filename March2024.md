### Complaining in the Desert ###

### Day 61: ‚ÄúComplaint of rebellion‚Äù ###

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves ‚Äì where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us üôè
