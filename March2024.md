### Complaining in the Desert

[![Complaining in the Desert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day061.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1VjA7vISyac "Complaining in the Desert")

### Day 61: “Complaint of rebellion”

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves – where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us 🙏

### Spies Sent to Canaan

[![Spies Sent to Canaan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day062.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UmoB_TfaWWo "Spies Sent to Canaan")

### Day 62: “Family Feud”

JOKE ALERT: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ 😁
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses’ wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it’s important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What’s important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick – the differences disappeared the brothers united – Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### Day 62 Anonymous

They are having sibling fights because Moses married a Cushite woman.
In God's sight Moses had done nothing wrong in marrying her, if that was so The Lord would have said something about him.  Moses is innocent.  So The Lord calls all three, and ONLY Miriam is punished. Why?

1. Consequences for our actions.
2. Immediately that unites Aaron and Moses.  All three are united in prayer again.

Moses who had been chosen as The Lord's prophet speaking specifically not only with God but on behalf of God.

The greatest miracle that has ever happened is The Incarnation and Redemption Salvation of the world.

Lord, give us the grace to say yes to You in everything.

Remember what The Lord has done.

### Israel's Rebellion

[![Israel's Rebellion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day063.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0TIAYr9W5pw "Israel's Rebellion")

### Day 63: “Slow to anger and abounding in mercy”

The Israelites are a rebellious people, they were delivered from the strongest army – the Egyptians. God almighty the great ‘I AM’ is with them, He delivered them from Egypt – with supernatural events – the plagues, the parting of the Dead Sea, feeding in the desert, and water from the rock. Even though the Lord led them with a mighty hand and an outreached arm, even though the Lord was fighting for them. The Israelites were rebelling over and over again, they were a rebellious people. They even decided to go back to Egypt, they said let us appoint a captain and go back.

Is this not our story, do we not keep drifting away from the Lord. The Lord has done great things in our lives, he has provided us with a good life – and if you can read this today – you are more fortunate than half the people in the world or maybe even more, as they are so poor that they do not have internet access. We should stop complaining and remember all the sins the Lord delivered us from, this will help us realize how unworthy we are. We should not think of backsliding or the temporary pleasure we had when we committed sins in the past.

Even though we are so fickle-minded and rebellious, and we continuously fall back into our old sins. The Lord is patient – He is slow to anger and abounding in mercy.

We cannot mix the old and the new clothes – we cannot carry on with old sins and try to pretend that we are holy. The old has gone and the new has come.

“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old" Luke 5:36

Remember that the Lord is patient and is waiting for us to change, He has not left us even though we are not worthy, even though we keep going back to the old sins. May the Lord strengthen us and liberate us from our sinful past.

Also want to call out that we see some Israelites not listening to instructions, getting impatience, and wanting to take on the Amalekites and Canaanites on their own intuition – they decided to go out on their own strength without taking the Ark of the covenant or without the guidance of the Lord(the pillar smoke and fire) – they FAILED – the Amalekites and Canaanites came down and defeated them.

We have to listen to the Lord and wait on Him, not take things into our own hands. Just follow the instructions the Lord gives us and it will be good with us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏

### Day 63 Maryanne C.M.

+God Hears every murmur against him, n there is a consequence for the same. Let us not murmur even in our hearts.
+The spies took 40 days and for each day they hd to spend a year in wilderness. Hence the 40years in wanderings.
+Those who hd to return with a strategy to proceed, returned with fear n defeat in their words. Acting on the reports of fear, the Israelites make plans to return to slavery!! Let us not be bogged down by the arrows of fear that the enemy strikes at us, but remain in confident faith like Caleb and Joshua.
+"...they were driven by fear and paralysed by distrust that marked their hearts..." Let us not be driven by fear in our lives, in Jesus' Name.
+"... bcoz they were unwilling to battle their children hd to do the battle..."
+"...let us take up arms against whatever enslaves us..."
\+ There is One Place for Worship.
+"...be careful if you r close to d Tabernacle or temple, you may not just eat whatever kind of meat that u wud like to..." This also pertains to other consumptions too, like what we listen to or watch!
+Deut 12 is more connected to worship than just abt eating.
Amen.🙏

### Revolt Against Moses

[![Revolt Against Moses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day065.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_ZxhfZw4644 "Revolt Against Moses")

### Day 65 “Why are there no women priests in the Catholic Church”

We see that Moses faced a lot of resistance. We have seen this come up over and over again, people revolt against Moses (actually revolt against the Lord – Moses is just following the Lord’s instructions).

1. We see Aaron and Miriam having an issue with Moses' wife

2. the spies have a problem and refuse to take on the tall people (even though the Lord defeated Egypt -the strongest nation for them)

3. we see a revolt among those who are non-Levites – as they want to become priests. (Only Levites were priests -as the Levites ordained themselves by taking a stand for the Lord by destroying the Baal worshipers – The Lord commanded that only Levites should be priests)

4. We see that Korah, Dothan, and Abiram accuse Moses of making up the rules and becoming a Price over them.

Moses fell on his face – meaning – he prayed – Moses was genuine – he was just doing what the Lord commanded. We see how they insisted, and the Lord answered directly – the earth opened and swallowed them up.

We see an increasing demand that Women should be allowed to be Catholic priests. There are a lot of merits to it – all of us have mothers and know how caring they are, they would make for a very caring priest. This would also demonstrate equality and help solve the vocation crisis or would have potentially prevented a lot of the sex abuse scandals. The list could go on, but are we not thinking like “Korah, Dothan and Abiram” – let us not think humanly (although it makes a lot of sense and is practical for women to become priests)

There could be many reasons for male priests but would state two.

1. JESUS APPOINTED ONLY MEN AS APOSTLES.

Jesus picked 12 apostles all of whom were men.

Some would say that Jesus was restricted to an era of a male-dominated society – I choose to differ – Jesus was never influenced by the society - he ate with sinners - tax collectors, prostitutes, pagans, -his disciples did not follow washing of the hands and fasting.

Jesus healed on the sabbath, healed leapers and women with the hemorrhoids touched his cloak. He never bothered about becoming unclean -because He was holiness Himself.

Jesus’ ministry was supported by many women and they were His best followers (even to the cross). Jesus was very caring towards women in the gospel -ex: Mary and Martha. He approached the Samaritan women at the well. He had nothing against women.

Mary his mother would have been a perfect priest – as she could literally say this is my body (as Jesus took his human body from her) when she lifted the hosts in consecration. But Jesus chose 12 men – it’s not men who decided that priests should be men. He washed the feet of the apostles in the upper room as we will read later in BIAY – washing the feet was a ceremony for anointing.

2. THE PRIEST REPRESENTS CHRIST

The priests are called to embody Christ (Persona Christi) He is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride, we cannot have a female bridegroom (no disrespect to anyone who feels otherwise – it’s the biblical definition of the bridegroom). The Eucharist is a wedding banquet – Jesus is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride. Jesus came to this world as a man and the priest needs to embody that. Also by nature/biology, the man provides the seed and the women nurture it and care for it to fulfillment as a baby. In the same way, the priests (Persona Christi) initiate Spiritual children through the sacraments of the church like Baptism, that's why we call the priests fathers as they are spiritual fathers. The church (laity – both women and men)like women nurture spiritual children until they reach heaven.

Although like St John Paul II says we need to celebrate the “genius of women” in the church – without women, no parish will last a week. Just look at the many talents and services women do for the functioning of the parish. Their maternal care and love for the priests and the congregation is commendable. Jesus first appeared to a woman and not to a man after He rose from the dead, the first evangelist was a woman. Women are called to greatness and to do great things for the Lord and for the church, to be evangelists, leaders of ministries, heads of councils, proclaimers of the word of God, Eucharistic Ministers, Lectors, counselors, prayer group leaders and even lead communion service(No consecration of bread) and many more ministries to complement the priests in their ministry. Men are priests not because they are better than women but because of the nature of Christ.

Hope my reflection was clear and to the point. We are called to worship God as He wants us to not how we want to.

If you have other opinions, I respect them and we are still brothers and sisters in Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Forbidden Forms of Worship

[![Forbidden Forms of Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day066.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Rn4UHDqh0F0 "Forbidden Forms of Worship")

### Day 66: Forbidden forms of worship – Magic, horoscopes, fortune-telling

We see the stern warning of the Lord that is given to the Israelites – preparing them for entry into the promised land.

“When you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations. 10 No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead.” Deuteronomy 18

There are some practices that have crept into our daily lives without us discerning properly?

One common thing is reading the daily horoscope prediction – or following sun signs.

For example – Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. I got a kick out of this description as I am supposedly Aries ;) but It’s BS 😀 There are so many Aries who are just the opposite. Hehe.

People read their fortune in the horoscope columns and believe it, or go to a Psychic, tarot card reader, or palm reader. It’s just like having a sun, moon, or star god, or believing that the stars and creation rule our lives instead of the creator.

Some people use spirit mediums to get solutions or to conjure the dead. There is an increase in satanism and occult practices. Witchcraft, voodoo dolls, and black magic are common in some cultures. They are allowing after-school Satanist clubs now, remember they threw out the 10 commandments and now allow this.

There are also new age practices each person is their own divinity – I’m my own god.

Many people follow superstations as well like – black cat crossing your path, touch wood, a horseshoe for good luck, sports superstitions.

All of these are placing our trust in the created things or practices, it's literally telling God that we trust in things of the world rather than in Almighty God.

We are breaking the first commandment the great Shema –

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might”" Deut 6

“Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.” Ps 20:7

Let us not put our lives and trust in created things, we owe that to the creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### God's Justice and Refuge

[![God's Justice and Refuge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day067.jpg)](https://youtu.be/W3v2a1gQl0Q "God's Justice and Refuge")

### Day 67 Anonymous

You care for justice, You care for us. Thank You Lord!

All the tribes of Israel were given land, property, etc. as their inheritance. But Levites were not given any inheritance, because The Lord Himself was their inheritance. The tithes would be given to them for their support and food.
Levites also have to give a tenth of their tithes from what they are receiving as tithes.
Wars of judgement
People of Cannan were living violent lives. God is using people of Israel to exact justice
You need to be faithful because thru you I am going to bless the people. God gives commandment knowing they wouldn't keep them.

### Reflection - Cathy Aggarao

This makes me reflect how priests come from a family, first. And the importance of making our family a domestic church. The active participation of families in parish and sacramental life leads to more young ones entering religious life or faithful professionals. I like how we are called to be sensitive to the needs of the religious and priesthood since we benefit from their works.
🙏Mother Mary, please pray for more youth to be open to religious and priestly life. Amen.

### The Bronze Serpent

[![The Bronze Serpent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day069.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IhUneF7QUKk "The Bronze Serpent")

### Day 69 Why do Catholic churches have a Crucifix and holy statues

The Catholics get a lot of flak for worshiping the crucifix or statues. We see the Israelites speak against God and against Moses again saying

“Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” 6 Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. 7 The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 8 And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.” 9 So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.

We see that those who sin and repented had to go and look at the pole and the serpent. Is God commanding idol worship here. No really “the pole and serpent” is just an icon for the people to pray to God, it was a place where people gathered to pray.

In the New Testament, Jesus brings this up again John 3.

And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

The Crucifix in the catholic church reminds us that Jesus became sin for us – he was cursed for our inequities – Jesus hangs on the cross with all our sin on Him – that’s why He looked so distressed and humiliated – when we look at the crucifix we need to be reminded of our sin – just as the Israelites looked at the bronze serpent and remembered their rebellion and their complaining – when they looked up to the bronze serpent they were healed. They are not healed by the pole and the serpent – but it serves as a reminder to ask God for healing.

In the same way, when Catholics pray at a crucifix or statue they are not praying or worshiping it – it is just an Icon to remember our sin and to ask God to heal us and give us eternal life.

The Holy statues are just icons of holy men and women whose example we ought to follow. I haven't met any catholic who worships a statue. 😀 Maybe you have, please introduce them to me. 😂

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Offense of Balaam

[![The Offense of Balaam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day070.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YTiFAPUE15A "The Offense of Balaam")

### Day 70 “God’s perfect will and permissive will”, “Talking donkey and angels - what? ”

We read about Balaam the soothsayer/prophet, going against the Lord’s command. Balaam initially accepted the Lord’s instruction about not cursing God’s chosen (this was God’s perfect will) and when Balaam was influenced with more money and influential people, he gave in. The Lord said OKAY you can go but you will say what I tell you (God’s permissive will).

We encounter this every day in our lives, we know what God wants of us – but we get influenced by this world – money and famous people tell us what to do. Even in the big decisions in life we tend to avoid God’s call – someone called to the religious life avoids it and regrets it later – the Lord is faithful even if we are not – he never leaves us and gives us the freedom to choose. Let us periodically spend time to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit to discern God’s will and let’s pray for the grace to accept His perfect will in our lives.

Like Jonah, the Lord will eventually take us on the path He predestined for us. The only difference is – if we listen to God’s voice we will have less resistance - less time in the fish's belly.

We see this incredible miracle of a talking donkey – the common knowledge is that donkeys are dumb animals. However we see that the dumb one was the human being, in this case, the donkey's eyes were opened to see the angel – with the drawn sword – the donkey was so good – trying to save Balaam’s life and its own I guess. We so often forget the spiritual realm. There are angels around us – our guardian angel and other angels that protect us.

For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways;
12 they will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. Ps 91

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
and he delivers them. Ps 34

Let us be aware of the lovely angels around us and don’t forget to pet your dog/cat. 😀

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Source of the Law

[![The Source of the Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day071.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9baaLM4owkY "The Source of the Law")

### Day 71 “If the Lord opens a door no one can close it”

We see Balak just won’t give up, he makes Balaam try again and again. Even though they build multiple alters and offer bulls and rams – the Lord will not change, what is man that he can attempt to change God’s mind/will.

As we live our Christian lives – we will have a lot of resistance, pushback, and even opposition. Do not worry the Lord is on our side, God is fighting for us.

Like Balak and Balaam, anyone against us (God’s chosen people) will have to say.

“He can I curse who God has not cursed” v8

“ Behold I receive a command to bless; he has blessed and I cannot revoke it ”v20 Numbers 23

Remember that nothing will happen to us that the Lord does not allow.

“No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from Me,” Says the Lord” (Isaiah 54:17).

Our God is for us and on our side, what can man do.

31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Rom 8

Just how – no nation could stop God’s people from entering the promised land. No one can close the door the Lord has opened in your life.

“Brave Soldier - Be positive, look up, and move on. He is with us. “

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 71 - Jenita

Living life as a Christian is challenging. Because always seem to be in a battle between our conscience and our desires. Even though we are rooted in God's words we waver from the plan God has for us.

But nothing can stop God's protection over us. So we just need to trust in God and move forward.

### The Plains of Moab

[![The Plains of Moab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day072.jpg)](https://youtu.be/86QY0R3QZ9c "The Plains of Moab")

### Day 72 “Rid yourself, family, and society of sin”

We see how faithful God is to the Israelites. We see the Lord is preventing Balaam from cursing the Israelites, he is unable to curse despite the pressure Balak put on him. The Lord has been leading the Israelites through the wilderness – feeding them and defeating many nations along the way – they are about to enter the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey. The Israelites should be praising God and worshiping Him, however, they are doing awful things to displease the Lord. They are doing shameful things with the Moabite women. Apart from going to the neighboring town one of the sons of Israel even brought a Midianite woman – walked past weeping Moses and Levites – and defiled the inner room of the tent. This would be like performing sexual acts on the altar of a catholic church. Phinehas a priest got up and put them to death and this stopped the plague.

I think the problem today is we have become comfortable with sin. We do not deal with sin as we should, we accept bad behavior and do not correct it. For example – earlier it was shameful for anyone to have sex before marriage or for anyone to live together before marriage. But today – everyone is very casual about the idea of living together before marriage just so that you can know the person and see if they are compatible. I don’t think this is working – look at the divorce rate it is through the roof.

We have become cowardly – if we see our kids doing this, we are afraid to correct them lest they stop talking to us. We are answerable to God; we have failed to correct our children and grandchildren.

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prob 13:24

Also, we tend to be timid with sin in our own lives. Sin can be imagined as a baby serpent – we should be running away from it; however, we keep it in our pocket - and bring it out every little while. One day this small serpent will become a huge anaconda and swallow us up.

Be aware!! Be aware!! of sin.

8 Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.1 Pet 5:8

Let us first discipline ourselves, then our children/family and then the society. This will stop the plague of the culture of death.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Inheritance of Land

[![Inheritance of Land](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day073.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FTEbxtb93Nk "Inheritance of Land")

### Day 73 “Catholic guilt”

We read in today’s Psalm about the fear of the Lord.

“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding.” Ps111:10

The fear of the Lord is indeed the beginning of wisdom, but what is the fear of the Lord. Am I supposed to be afraid of God, or am I supposed to be afraid of His wrath? Not true, we are not called to fear God, He is a loving and caring God – a God who sent His only son to die for us, the Father who knit us together in our mother’s womb, the Lord who does not slumber but watches over us, the one who knows when we come in and go out when we sit down and raise up, even before a word is on our lips – He knows it. We cannot be afraid of God – His nature is love itself.

What does the “fear of the Lord” mean – it means we should be afraid not to hurt Him who loves us much. We should be fearful to not offend Him, Him who loves us so deeply. We should be fearful to not let Him down, not to betray Him, when we have an opportunity to talk about Him.

The word “Catholics guilt” gets tossed around a lot. Folks tend to say that “Catholics are not even sure of their salvation” – “That they have an over-emphasis on their sin” – and “That they are running to confession all the time” --- All of those are NOT true – absolutely not true.

Catholics are very discerning and reverend people – we are not "a free for all – anything goes" type of people. We are serious about sin we define it very well, the catechism lists out all types of sin – venial and mortal, the deadly sins, the modern terms of sin (for example we have good definitions of sin like abortion, pornography, homosexuality, masturbation, rape, etc ) We are conscious of our sins, we carefully examine our hearts and go to confession. Once we make a confession – we know for a fact that our sins are forgiven – no doubt at all.

“whoever's sins you forgive are forgiven them” Jh 20”23

We come out rejoicing and celebrating – also heaven rejoices over one repented person than over 99 who don't need to.

Usually what people are referring to when they say Catholic guilt is a heresy called “Jansenism” from the 17th and 18th centuries.

Jansenism was an early modern theological movement within Catholicism, primarily active in the Kingdom of France, that emphasized original sin, human depravity, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination. It was declared a heresy by the Catholic Church.

In conclusion, the Catholics are very cognizant of their state of grace – their sin, once confessed it's forgiven and it’s out of the mind and we are a celebrating, rejoicing, and happy people.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 73 - Jenita

The census of the people again takes place before they enter the promised land after 40 long years. People who stayed faithful are blessed to enter the promised land.

This is a similar sign for us..

As we journey through the years on earth, may we remember that this journey will lead us to our savior, our final destination only by holding on to God. Let us remain faithful through the journey so that we too will be blessed to reach our promised land

### Joshua Appointed

[![Joshua Appointed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day074.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E2xL_CqTPZM "Joshua Appointed")

### Day 74 “Men and women are equal – both created in God’s image”

We see in today’s reading the daughters of Zelophehad - 5 of them came forward to demand equality for inheritance. Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah come up before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

What courage they must have had – to take a stand before the congregation.

“Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons. 4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father’s brothers.” Numbers 27:3,4

Moses needed to seek God’s guidance on this and sure enough the Lord said – yes Men and women are equal – the daughters should be given their due.

Moses brought their case before the Lord. 6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 7 The daughters of Zelophehad are right in what they are saying; you shall indeed let them possess an inheritance among their father’s brothers and pass the inheritance of their father on to them. Numbers 27:5-8

When God created man and women – He made no difference between the two. He created them both in His image.

So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. Gen 1:27

In Jesus’ earthly life he always took up for women the widows the orphans. Many women were his followers and supporters. Two of his good friends were Mary and Martha – and their brother Lazarus. Scripture scholars believed that Lazarus was physically challenged or very sick. The Greek word "asthenes" can be translated as "sick," "without strength," "feeble" or "insignificant."

Due to his condition, Lazarus was unable to care for the family and his sisters were not married because they had to care for Lazarus. Jesus loved them so dearly and cared for them – even brought back Lazarus to life.

Our God created everyone equal, men and women, black, white and brown, short, tall, weak, strong, smart, simple, special, normal. Jesus loves us all the same.

Let us stop hate or discrimination – we are called to love as God loves. Love everyone equally.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Keeping of Vows

[![The Keeping of Vows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day075.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mk2jOHxEPhI "The Keeping of Vows")

### Day 75 “Find your rest in the Lord”

We see the command to do no laborious work on the various feasts, the feast of the trumpets, the feast of booths, the feast of weeks… We read in the creation story that even God rested on the 7th day.

When something is repeated over and over again, that means it is very important. God wants us to be very clear about finding rest on Sunday. We work a lot all week long, from office work to household chores to running errands, all of which are mostly aimed at the earthly necessities – our calendars are full of that. God does not want us to be like Robots – working 24X7. We need to stop all this craziness at least on Sunday, turn our focus from business and work and other activities to nourish our souls.

Our focus on Sunday should be to go to church, not just show up – but prepare for it – study the Sunday scriptures in advance, examine our conscience may be on Saturday, and go to confession (prepare ourselves – have a day of atonement). Pick out the proper attire and keep it ready for Sunday Mass – remember it’s a wedding banquet that we are going to.

Also, "rest" meant that the Israelites would just stay in their tents and be with family. We should make use of Sunday for that – just stay home and delight in the family. Talk to each other/play board games or just cook out in the backyard.

In the gospel when Martha brought a complaint against Mary, Jesus said that the rest that Mary found listening to Him will not be taken away.

But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me.” 41 But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; 42 there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.” Luke 10:40-42

I hope we can be true to ourselves – not be distracted by many tasks but like Mary choose to sit at the feet of the Lord, as we enjoy our Sunday Mass and family time. If we pick this better part, it will not be taken away from us.

28 “Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” Matt 11:28-30

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### War Against Midian

[![War Against Midian](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day076.jpg)](https://youtu.be/lFFqQFmWLmY "War Against Midian")

### Day 76 “The freedom to choose – Choose life”

We read in today’s reading about choice, God gives us a choice, He could have just created us like rocks, trees, or wild animals that only have instinct. We have a rationale or reason and a choice, a choice to do good or bad to pick God or Evil.

The Catechism teaches

CCC 1730 God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him."26

I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, 20 loving the Lord your God, obeying him, and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days, so that you may live in the land that the Lord swore to give to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. Deuteronomy 30:19-20

In today’s scripture reading, we see God laying it out very clearly – He says that we need to pick either good or bad, life or death, blessing or curses. The choices we make allow God to save us. We are saved by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and resurrection – but we need to choose Jesus over sin. God will empower us to live a holy life and make good choices. Choices that bring blessings and a future in heaven. We need to make choices in life – choices that are pro-life and not pro-death, pro-choice at every stage from conception to natural death.

Our first parents Adam and Eve had a choice – but they messed up they picked evil over good – they listened to what the devil said over what God said. Even though they messed up – God gave us many more changes – which the Israelites kept messing up. Eventually, God gave us a new Eve – Mary who said “Yes” to God, and a new Adam – Jesus who said Yes to the will of the Father.

If we find ourselves in a place where we have made bad choices, let’s not fret – we need to return to God.

return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, 3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you Deut 30:2-3

We need to choose God, blessings flow when we choose God.

Psalm 91 starts with “He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High ” then the many blessings of protection are listed, but we need to dwell in Him first.

Also, Psalm 23 starts with – “The Lord is my shepherd” We need to make the Lord our shepherd which will bring many blessings – we will not be in need, He will make us lie down in green pastures, our cup will overflow.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### God is Faithful

[![God is Faithful](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day077.jpg)](https://youtu.be/LknGGOf2Ge4 "God is Faithful")

### Day 77 “Be strong and of good courage – the Lord goes with you, He will not fail you or forsake you”

Moses is getting up in age and it’s time for him to pass. Moses has lived a long life, a life of service – he was brought up in royalty – the Lord led him out of that comfortable life and made him the leader of the Israelites – he spent most of his life in the wilderness – the people of Israel have been revolting, complaining and falling into sin over and over again. God even tells Moses that after he dies the people are going to go back into sin and forsake the Lord. Even though the Lord will lead them into the promised land, the land flowing with milk and honey – they will despise Him even in their prosperity.

For when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they have eaten their fill and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant. Deut 31:20

BUT – even though the people backslide and give in to their own desires – God is faithful He is fighting for them and will never ever leave them. Even though we are unfaithful, God is faithful. He will remember His covenant from generation to generation. Even though we sin He is merciful. The Psalmist proclaims this in today’s Psalm

For great is his mercy towards us; and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Ps 117

If we examine our own lives, we see the same pattern of sin. We have complaints and grumbling when things go wrong, when we get sick or have so sufferings – we forsake the Lord. Even when we are prosperous, we forget the Lord, just like the Israelites who were given everything a land flowing with milk and honey – yet they turned to other gods and served them. So we cannot blame our circumstances or condition as we forsake the Lord when we are "in need" and when we are "full".

Our God loves us despite our sinfulness and shortcomings.

Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. Rom 5:7

Let us not be discouraged by our sin, but encouraged by God’s mercy and faithfulness. Let's remember this famous quote from St Faustina.

The greater the sinner, the greater the right he has to My mercy. - St Faustina

We need to read those words that Moses used to encourage Joshua. Maybe read it a few times and be encouraged today that God is Merciful and Faithful.

Be strong and of good courage, do not fear or be in dread of them: for it is the Lord your God who goes with you; he will not fail you or forsake you.” Deut 31:6

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Song of Moses

[![The Song of Moses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day078.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E1dXrYOBedk "The Song of Moses")

### Day 78 “Listen to the right music – it impacts us” “The one who sings prays twice"

I’m sure you have had a song stuck in your head, usually, it’s the refrain of a song or a line or the melody that keeps playing nonstop and you can’t get it out of your head. More than 90% of adults report that this happens to them at least once a week. Research suggests that songs may get stuck due to repetitive lyrics that activate the brain's reward system. There is some interesting science about how music can affect us, it stirs up emotions and memories and even leads us to do certain actions.

We see that the Lord who created and programmed us, uses this faculty of the human being – God knew that after Moses' death, the Israelites would fall into sin again, even after they enter the promised land and received everything they needed, they would still sin. God gave Moses a song that the people would sing and memories and get stuck in their heads. This was preparation for the time they would fall into sin and then this song would remind them of God’s goodness and they would return to God.

In the desert wondering, most of the commandments would have been taught verbally and they would call an assembly of the people are read the commandments of the Lord over and over again.

I think we should learn something from this, if we listen to music with very a negative message or hate, we will eventually become that. If we listen to Christian music that has the word of God in its lyrics, we will praise God while we listen and the songs and lyrics will also get stored in our brain and be brought up when we need it.

I listen to good music, even when I’m working – the brain is powerful enough to praise God and work at the same time. Let us find some good Christina music and binge-listen.

Not only listen, but we also got to sing it as well. Don’t worry if you don’t have a good voice.

The bible says - Make a joyful noise

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.

Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.

Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise:

be thankful unto him, and bless his name. PS 100:1,4

St. Augustine had this very famous saying

“The one who sings prays twice”.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Psalms of Ascent

[![Psalms of Ascent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day079.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VHkF-YokdRE "Psalms of Ascent")

### Day 79: “Moses’ great example to "Bless those who curse you"”

As we read the final blessing of Moses, Man-O-Man what a gem of a person Moses. The people of Israel were not “happy campers” they companied, and they accused Moses of so many things – they were afraid that the Egyptian army would kill them, complaints about lack of water, food, no meat, no garlic, fear of fighting tribes with tall people, they were a people that never headed Moses’ words(God’s instruction) and stiff-necked people.

But Moses did not count all their failures and say "you cursed people, you ruined my life, I could not even see the promised land". Instead, Moses blesses them, and does not curse them. There is a lesson to learn, we are called to bless and not curse.

Even if people are hard to handle and can get in our hair, we must have a heart like Moses that blesses and not curses. We need a heart of Jesus that is able to say “Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing”

bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 29 To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from him who takes away your cloak do not withhold your coat as well. Luke 6:28-29

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Cities of Refuge

[![Cities of Refuge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day080.jpg)](https://youtu.be/MkrOjI8JEdk "Cities of Refuge")

### Day 80 “God is watching over us – 24X7”

Sometimes, we can feel that God is distant or not concerned about us. We may experience loneliness and even go into depression if we do not get the help and support, we need.

Let us be reminded that God is aware of everything that is happening in our lives. The Psalm in today’s readings is a big reminder that God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord is our keeper, He will be our shade and not let our foot be moved. Apart from protecting us physically, He will preserve our souls. He will keep us from evil from this time on and forevermore. Another Psalm that reminds us of this is "Psalm 139" – God knows when we sit down, rise up, come in, go out, He knows our times of activity and rest, even before a word is on our lips He already knows it.

When it was time for the Israelites to go and worship the Lord and offer their sacrifices and tithes. They would have to go up (even if they were in the North) because they were going up to Mount Zion. Imagine going on a trek up the mountain ascending the mountain to pray. What would our attitude be?

Can’t help but admire the trust the psalmist had in the Lord. The Psalmist looked up to the hills, looked up to the skies, and looked up to God. He did not look at the problems or difficulties around him, but lifted up his eyes and set his gaze on the Lord.

I lift my eyes up to the hills, from where does my help come?

We should fix our gaze on Jesus, we should not be overly obsessed with our own problems and issues. Because our help comes from the Lord. And as we look up let us remember that God is always lovingly looking at us. He cares for us.

Let us just read today’s Psalm and pray it again. In fact, we should pray it every day, it will remind us that God is watching over us.

I lift up my eyes to the hills—

from where will my help come?

2 My help comes from the Lord,

who made heaven and earth.

3 He will not let your foot be moved;

he who keeps you will not slumber.

4 He who keeps Israel

will neither slumber nor sleep.

5 The Lord is your keeper;

the Lord is your shade at your right hand.

6 The sun shall not strike you by day,

nor the moon by night.

7 The Lord will keep you from all evil;

he will keep your life.

8 The Lord will keep

your going out and your coming in

from this time on and forevermore.

PS 121

Congratulations on completing two books Numbers and Deuteronomy. 80 days of reading God’s word. It feels Awesome. Praise the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Israel Crosses the Jordan

[![Israel Crosses the Jordan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day081.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6e_ec2fwcPA "Israel Crosses the Jordan")

### Day 81 “Stack up stones of good memories, remember what the Lord has done”

Human tendency is to forget, forget the good things that have been done to us. One usually clings to negative things or experiences. The people of Israel started their journey with the parting of the Red Sea – it was a great miracle and one to be remembered forever. However, the people forgot it too soon, they kept doubting the Lord and complaining from time to time. Now the Lord our faithful God has journeyed with them, guiding them by smoke and fire every step of the way. The Lord also prepared their hearts to enter the promised land, they were given the 10 commandments and detailed instructions on moral law, details about worship. They are ready to enter the promised land – a land flowing with milk and honey.

The desert wanderings started with the parting of the read sea and ends with the parting of the Jordan – as soon as the feet of those carrying the Tabernacle entered the Jordan the river stopped flowing (again this should not be assumed as low tide/water – there is a mention that the Jordan usually overflowed its banks) - the Lord commanded each tribe to pick one stone from the dept of the banks of the river Jordan – to remind them that the Lord did dry up the Jordan. This would be a memory for generations to come so that the Israelites would remember the faithfulness of the Lord. Just as each tribe picked up one stone from the depts of the Jordan, we need to pick up something when we are going through the depts/difficult times(sickness, job loss, losing a loved one, etc) – to remember that the Lord has brought us through it.

We need to have some way to remember the good things the Lord has done for us. Just as we pick up souvenirs when we visit a new place. A prayer journal is a good idea, highlighting your bible, writing up reflections. I have all my reflections from day 1 till now stored in a file, I plan to read them as I go through the BIAY again maybe in 2024, (if Ascension does the catechism in a year in 2023)

We need to memorize the word of God as well, as the Lord commanded to write them on the doorposts and on your garments. We need to read and re-read the living word of God until it is written on our hearts.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 81 Maryanne C.M.

### Day 81 -  Jenita

🎶"God will make a way, where there seems to be no way"🎶

This song certainly rings a jingle in my head, as it very much speaks of how God does the unimaginable to make us move forward in this journey of life.

Whatever maybe our situation, whatever be our position in life.. We must remember that we serve a faithful God who does marvelous miracles which cannot be explained by human intelligence. We serve a God will will move mountains and part seas and rivers just so we can go into green pastures.

We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we in testing times we may look at these rocks(miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope.

He will never leave us nor forsake us! !!

What a mighty God we serve

### Day 81 - Gabriella

Commenting on *Jenita’s* note above, I totally agree with her heartfelt reflection.

_We only need to pick up stones of his wonderful deeds for us as a remembrance of his faithfulness, so that when we are in testing times we may look at these rocks (miracles) and know that we are not alone and that there is hope._

These words reminded me of our Lord’s
🌹Blessed Mother, Our Lady Undoer of Knots Novena, meditation part for day 4 as it reads:

*O Mother, ask Jesus to heal my paralytic faith which gets down hearted with the stones on the road.*

\*Along with you, dearest Mother, may I see these stones as friends. Not murmuring against them anymore but giving endless thanks for them, may I smile trustingly in your power.\*  \_*Mary, Undoer of Knots, pray for me. Mary is the Sun and no one is deprived of her warmth.*\_

Praise God for His steadfast love and mercy through Her endless intercession!

*Deuteronomy 31:8*
“The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”

### The Valley of Achor

[![The Valley of Achor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day082.jpg)](https://youtu.be/D-UdZ6xWcWw "The Valley of Achor")

### Day 82 Holding on to sin

We are all aware of the fall of Jericho, the great and fortified city that was standing in the way of the Israelites entering the promised land. An angel with a drawn sword appeared to Joshua and said the same thing that was said to Moses at the start of Moses Exodus – “Put off the shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy”. Joshua like Moses in the burning bush experienced a closeness to the Lord, something that would help them lead the people confidently.

The Lord gave Joshua special instructions to march around the city with the ark of the covenant for 7 days with trumpet blasts and on day 7 the walls of Jericho would fall. I guess we do similar prayers when we take the Eucharistic Lord in processions around the neighborhood.

The Lord instructed the Israelites not to take anything from the land that they conquered, lest these things defile them. However, Achan was lured into collecting some of the spoils. Because of his sin, the Lord was not with Israel when they attempted to capture this tiny hill city of Ai. The sin of Achan caused 36 good Israelites to be slain by the Ai. Even after seeing this Achan did not come forth, his sin had to be revealed by the Lord. That is when they had to stone Achan in the valley of Achor (trouble/sadness/destruction/shame), let us be reminded that it is our own sin that brings destruction, God does not want to see us get hurt or lose our soul.

Let us take a life lesson from this, we should not hold on to certain sins. One usually tends to hold onto a few favorite sins, the ones we really enjoy. Let us pray for the strength to let go of the things of the world, lest we lose our souls.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Gibeonite Trickery

[![The Gibeonite Trickery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day083.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UM8fMnMckKM "The Gibeonite Trickery")

### Day 83 Strategy and deception

We see how Joshua was instructed to use a Military ambush strategy to conquer Ai. Just yesterday we read how Ai defeated the Israelites because the Lord was not with them. The Lord can use our mistakes and write straight with crooked lines, the Lord asked Joshua to set ambush soldiers and then flee as they did the previous time, once the Ai men started following the fleeing Israelites the Ambush soldiers would go in and set the city on fire. The Lord used the mistakes of the Israelites to bring victory. We also read of the hasty decision that the Israelites made towards making a covenant with the Gibeonites, the Gibeonites deceived the Israelites pretending to have come from far away. However, the Lord blesses this decision and graphs the Gibeonites into the Israelites. We will see how the Gibeonites will bear very useful people in the future.

In our lives we may have made wrong decisions may be married the wrong person, took up the wrong job, wasted out family inheritance, did bad things when we were young – like drugs/alcohol/guns, maybe even have a criminal record. Let us not be disheartened but entrust everything to the Lord for our God can use our scares to bring healing to the nations.

All things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose: Romans 8:28

Also, we need to have a strategy to defeat our enemies, our enemy is sin and the devil. We need to learn how to avoid sin, for example – if you struggle with sins of gossip, then give yourself a time limit when you talk about others or choose to never name people – use words like us instead of him/her.

If you struggle with lust, then ensure you are never along with your devices.

If you struggle with anger, then have a strategy to never speak until you calm down.

Come up with a strategy to fight and burn up sin in our lives.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Sun Stands Still

### Day 84 Nature obeys God

God is the creator of everything and everything is in place just by His will. If God wills the sun to stop shining, it will. We see in today’s reading how the surrounding Kings are plotting to join forces and kill the Israelites. However they do not know that they are actually fighting against God, we read that there were more men slain by Hailstones as compared to by the sword.

the Lord threw down huge stones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the Israelites killed with the sword. Josh 10:11

The Lord was fighting for them, they won not by the power of their army, but by the mighty hand of the Lord. The Lord made the sun stand still until the Israelites won.

There are many examples even in our modern times where we see nature obey God’s people. For example, the spinning of the sun at Fathima.

The Miracle of the Sun (Portuguese: Milagre do Sol), also known as the Miracle of Fátima, is a series of events reported to have occurred miraculously on 13 October 1917, attended by a large crowd who had gathered in Fátima, Portugal, in response to a prophecy made by three shepherd children, Lúcia Santos and Francisco and Jacinta Marto. The prophecy was that the Virgin Mary (referred to as Our Lady of Fátima), would appear and perform miracles on that date. Newspapers published testimony from witnesses who said that they had seen extraordinary solar activity, such as the Sun appearing to "dance" or zig-zag in the sky, careen towards the Earth, or emit multicolored light and radiant colors. According to these reports, the event lasted approximately ten minutes.

Also, St Thomas Apostle of India did some great miracles – to convert the Hindu's who believed nature was God.

According to tradition, St. Thomas made his first conversions by a miracle. At the village of Palur, he found some Brahman priests throwing handfuls of water into the air as they performed their purification prayers. Thomas threw some water into the air himself, and it hung suspended in the form of sparkling flowers. Tradition continues that most of the Brahmans embraced Christianity on the spot, and that the rest fled

Speaking about nature gods, the native Americans in Mexico and around worshiped Aztec gods of the sun and the moon, when I visited Mexico City I went to the huge pyramids of the sun and the moon gods. That’s when the Miraculous picture of our lady was given to the people, Our Lady of Guadalupe has the moon under her feet and the sun behind her, she has stars in her mantle – however, her eyes were looking downwards in humility depicting that she is not God. This image was not painted -it supernaturally appeared when the peasant Juan Diego – tried to show the flowers he collected on the hill to the Bishop, there was a bright light and the painting appeared.

There are so many mysterious attributes to the image – it never faded after centuries – even though it was on a poor-quality peasants cloak, the painting technique understood, there was a bomb blast next to it but it wasn’t destroyed, the eyes have exact imagery that is seen in a natural eye – with actual people seen in the retina.

This image converted millions of people to the faith.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
