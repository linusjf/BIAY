### Complaining in the Desert

[![Complaining in the Desert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day061.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1VjA7vISyac "Complaining in the Desert")

### Day 61: “Complaint of rebellion”

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves – where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us 🙏

### Spies Sent to Canaan

[![Spies Sent to Canaan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day062.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UmoB_TfaWWo "Spies Sent to Canaan")

### Day 62: “Family Feud”

JOKE ALERT: WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ 😁
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses’ wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it’s important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What’s important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick – the differences disappeared the brothers united – Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### Day 62 Anonymous

They are having sibling fights because Moses married a Cushite woman.
In God's sight Moses had done nothing wrong in marrying her, if that was so The Lord would have said something about him.  Moses is innocent.  So The Lord calls all three, and ONLY Miriam is punished. Why?

1. Consequences for our actions.
2. Immediately that unites Aaron and Moses.  All three are united in prayer again.

Moses who had been chosen as The Lord's prophet speaking specifically not only with God but on behalf of God.

The greatest miracle that has ever happened is The Incarnation and Redemption Salvation of the world.

Lord, give us the grace to say yes to You in everything.

Remember what The Lord has done.

### Israel's Rebellion

[![Israel's Rebellion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day063.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0TIAYr9W5pw "Israel's Rebellion")

### Day 63: “Slow to anger and abounding in mercy”

The Israelites are a rebellious people, they were delivered from the strongest army – the Egyptians. God almighty the great ‘I AM’ is with them, He delivered them from Egypt – with supernatural events – the plagues, the parting of the Dead Sea, feeding in the desert, and water from the rock. Even though the Lord led them with a mighty hand and an outreached arm, even though the Lord was fighting for them. The Israelites were rebelling over and over again, they were a rebellious people. They even decided to go back to Egypt, they said let us appoint a captain and go back.

Is this not our story, do we not keep drifting away from the Lord. The Lord has done great things in our lives, he has provided us with a good life – and if you can read this today – you are more fortunate than half the people in the world or maybe even more, as they are so poor that they do not have internet access. We should stop complaining and remember all the sins the Lord delivered us from, this will help us realize how unworthy we are. We should not think of backsliding or the temporary pleasure we had when we committed sins in the past.

Even though we are so fickle-minded and rebellious, and we continuously fall back into our old sins. The Lord is patient – He is slow to anger and abounding in mercy.

We cannot mix the old and the new clothes – we cannot carry on with old sins and try to pretend that we are holy. The old has gone and the new has come.

“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old" Luke 5:36

Remember that the Lord is patient and is waiting for us to change, He has not left us even though we are not worthy, even though we keep going back to the old sins. May the Lord strengthen us and liberate us from our sinful past.

Also want to call out that we see some Israelites not listening to instructions, getting impatience, and wanting to take on the Amalekites and Canaanites on their own intuition – they decided to go out on their own strength without taking the Ark of the covenant or without the guidance of the Lord(the pillar smoke and fire) – they FAILED – the Amalekites and Canaanites came down and defeated them.

We have to listen to the Lord and wait on Him, not take things into our own hands. Just follow the instructions the Lord gives us and it will be good with us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us 🙏

### Day 63 Maryanne C.M.

+God Hears every murmur against him, n there is a consequence for the same. Let us not murmur even in our hearts.
+The spies took 40 days and for each day they hd to spend a year in wilderness. Hence the 40years in wanderings.
+Those who hd to return with a strategy to proceed, returned with fear n defeat in their words. Acting on the reports of fear, the Israelites make plans to return to slavery!! Let us not be bogged down by the arrows of fear that the enemy strikes at us, but remain in confident faith like Caleb and Joshua.
+"...they were driven by fear and paralysed by distrust that marked their hearts..." Let us not be driven by fear in our lives, in Jesus' Name.
+"... bcoz they were unwilling to battle their children hd to do the battle..."
+"...let us take up arms against whatever enslaves us..."
\+ There is One Place for Worship.
+"...be careful if you r close to d Tabernacle or temple, you may not just eat whatever kind of meat that u wud like to..." This also pertains to other consumptions too, like what we listen to or watch!
+Deut 12 is more connected to worship than just abt eating.
Amen.🙏

### Revolt Against Moses

[![Revolt Against Moses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day065.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_ZxhfZw4644 "Revolt Against Moses")

### Day 65 “Why are there no women priests in the Catholic Church”

We see that Moses faced a lot of resistance. We have seen this come up over and over again, people revolt against Moses (actually revolt against the Lord – Moses is just following the Lord’s instructions).

1. We see Aaron and Miriam having an issue with Moses' wife

2. the spies have a problem and refuse to take on the tall people (even though the Lord defeated Egypt -the strongest nation for them)

3. we see a revolt among those who are non-Levites – as they want to become priests. (Only Levites were priests -as the Levites ordained themselves by taking a stand for the Lord by destroying the Baal worshipers – The Lord commanded that only Levites should be priests)

4. We see that Korah, Dothan, and Abiram accuse Moses of making up the rules and becoming a Price over them.

Moses fell on his face – meaning – he prayed – Moses was genuine – he was just doing what the Lord commanded. We see how they insisted, and the Lord answered directly – the earth opened and swallowed them up.

We see an increasing demand that Women should be allowed to be Catholic priests. There are a lot of merits to it – all of us have mothers and know how caring they are, they would make for a very caring priest. This would also demonstrate equality and help solve the vocation crisis or would have potentially prevented a lot of the sex abuse scandals. The list could go on, but are we not thinking like “Korah, Dothan and Abiram” – let us not think humanly (although it makes a lot of sense and is practical for women to become priests)

There could be many reasons for male priests but would state two.

1. JESUS APPOINTED ONLY MEN AS APOSTLES.

Jesus picked 12 apostles all of whom were men.

Some would say that Jesus was restricted to an era of a male-dominated society – I choose to differ – Jesus was never influenced by the society - he ate with sinners - tax collectors, prostitutes, pagans, -his disciples did not follow washing of the hands and fasting.

Jesus healed on the sabbath, healed leapers and women with the hemorrhoids touched his cloak. He never bothered about becoming unclean -because He was holiness Himself.

Jesus’ ministry was supported by many women and they were His best followers (even to the cross). Jesus was very caring towards women in the gospel -ex: Mary and Martha. He approached the Samaritan women at the well. He had nothing against women.

Mary his mother would have been a perfect priest – as she could literally say this is my body (as Jesus took his human body from her) when she lifted the hosts in consecration. But Jesus chose 12 men – it’s not men who decided that priests should be men. He washed the feet of the apostles in the upper room as we will read later in BIAY – washing the feet was a ceremony for anointing.

2. THE PRIEST REPRESENTS CHRIST

The priests are called to embody Christ (Persona Christi) He is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride, we cannot have a female bridegroom (no disrespect to anyone who feels otherwise – it’s the biblical definition of the bridegroom). The Eucharist is a wedding banquet – Jesus is the bridegroom, and the church is the bride. Jesus came to this world as a man and the priest needs to embody that. Also by nature/biology, the man provides the seed and the women nurture it and care for it to fulfillment as a baby. In the same way, the priests (Persona Christi) initiate Spiritual children through the sacraments of the church like Baptism, that's why we call the priests fathers as they are spiritual fathers. The church (laity – both women and men)like women nurture spiritual children until they reach heaven.

Although like St John Paul II says we need to celebrate the “genius of women” in the church – without women, no parish will last a week. Just look at the many talents and services women do for the functioning of the parish. Their maternal care and love for the priests and the congregation is commendable. Jesus first appeared to a woman and not to a man after He rose from the dead, the first evangelist was a woman. Women are called to greatness and to do great things for the Lord and for the church, to be evangelists, leaders of ministries, heads of councils, proclaimers of the word of God, Eucharistic Ministers, Lectors, counselors, prayer group leaders and even lead communion service(No consecration of bread) and many more ministries to complement the priests in their ministry. Men are priests not because they are better than women but because of the nature of Christ.

Hope my reflection was clear and to the point. We are called to worship God as He wants us to not how we want to.

If you have other opinions, I respect them and we are still brothers and sisters in Christ.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Forbidden Forms of Worship

[![Forbidden Forms of Worship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day066.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Rn4UHDqh0F0 "Forbidden Forms of Worship")

### Day 66: Forbidden forms of worship – Magic, horoscopes, fortune-telling

We see the stern warning of the Lord that is given to the Israelites – preparing them for entry into the promised land.

“When you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations. 10 No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead.” Deuteronomy 18

There are some practices that have crept into our daily lives without us discerning properly?

One common thing is reading the daily horoscope prediction – or following sun signs.

For example – Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. I got a kick out of this description as I am supposedly Aries ;) but It’s BS 😀 There are so many Aries who are just the opposite. Hehe.

People read their fortune in the horoscope columns and believe it, or go to a Psychic, tarot card reader, or palm reader. It’s just like having a sun, moon, or star god, or believing that the stars and creation rule our lives instead of the creator.

Some people use spirit mediums to get solutions or to conjure the dead. There is an increase in satanism and occult practices. Witchcraft, voodoo dolls, and black magic are common in some cultures. They are allowing after-school Satanist clubs now, remember they threw out the 10 commandments and now allow this.

There are also new age practices each person is their own divinity – I’m my own god.

Many people follow superstations as well like – black cat crossing your path, touch wood, a horseshoe for good luck, sports superstitions.

All of these are placing our trust in the created things or practices, it's literally telling God that we trust in things of the world rather than in Almighty God.

We are breaking the first commandment the great Shema –

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might”" Deut 6

“Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.” Ps 20:7

Let us not put our lives and trust in created things, we owe that to the creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

[![God's Justice and Refuge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day067.jpg)](https://youtu.be/W3v2a1gQl0Q "God's Justice and Refuge")

### Day 67 Anonymous

You care for justice, You care for us. Thank You Lord!

All the tribes of Israel were given land, property, etc. as their inheritance. But Levites were not given any inheritance, because The Lord Himself was their inheritance. The tithes would be given to them for their support and food.
Levites also have to give a tenth of their tithes from what they are receiving as tithes.
Wars of judgement
People of Cannan were living violent lives. God is using people of Israel to exact justice
You need to be faithful because thru you I am going to bless the people. God gives commandment knowing they wouldn't keep them.

### Reflection - Cathy Aggarao

This makes me reflect how priests come from a family, first. And the importance of making our family a domestic church. The active participation of families in parish and sacramental life leads to more young ones entering religious life or faithful professionals. I like how we are called to be sensitive to the needs of the religious and priesthood since we benefit from their works.
🙏Mother Mary, please pray for more youth to be open to religious and priestly life. Amen.

### The Bronze Serpent

[![The Bronze Serpent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day069.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IhUneF7QUKk "The Bronze Serpent")

### Day 69 Why do Catholic churches have a Crucifix and holy statues

The Catholics get a lot of flak for worshiping the crucifix or statues. We see the Israelites speak against God and against Moses again saying

“Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we detest this miserable food.” 6 Then the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died. 7 The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 8 And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a poisonous serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten shall look at it and live.” 9 So Moses made a serpent of bronze, and put it upon a pole; and whenever a serpent bit someone, that person would look at the serpent of bronze and live.

We see that those who sin and repented had to go and look at the pole and the serpent. Is God commanding idol worship here. No really “the pole and serpent” is just an icon for the people to pray to God, it was a place where people gathered to pray.

In the New Testament, Jesus brings this up again John 3.

And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

The Crucifix in the catholic church reminds us that Jesus became sin for us – he was cursed for our inequities – Jesus hangs on the cross with all our sin on Him – that’s why He looked so distressed and humiliated – when we look at the crucifix we need to be reminded of our sin – just as the Israelites looked at the bronze serpent and remembered their rebellion and their complaining – when they looked up to the bronze serpent they were healed. They are not healed by the pole and the serpent – but it serves as a reminder to ask God for healing.

In the same way, when Catholics pray at a crucifix or statue they are not praying or worshiping it – it is just an Icon to remember our sin and to ask God to heal us and give us eternal life.

The Holy statues are just icons of holy men and women whose example we ought to follow. I haven't met any catholic who worships a statue. 😀 Maybe you have, please introduce them to me. 😂

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Offense of Balaam

[![The Offense of Balaam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day070.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YTiFAPUE15A "The Offense of Balaam")

### Day 70 “God’s perfect will and permissive will”, “Talking donkey and angels - what? ”

We read about Balaam the soothsayer/prophet, going against the Lord’s command. Balaam initially accepted the Lord’s instruction about not cursing God’s chosen (this was God’s perfect will) and when Balaam was influenced with more money and influential people, he gave in. The Lord said OKAY you can go but you will say what I tell you (God’s permissive will).

We encounter this every day in our lives, we know what God wants of us – but we get influenced by this world – money and famous people tell us what to do. Even in the big decisions in life we tend to avoid God’s call – someone called to the religious life avoids it and regrets it later – the Lord is faithful even if we are not – he never leaves us and gives us the freedom to choose. Let us periodically spend time to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit to discern God’s will and let’s pray for the grace to accept His perfect will in our lives.

Like Jonah, the Lord will eventually take us on the path He predestined for us. The only difference is – if we listen to God’s voice we will have less resistance - less time in the fish's belly.

We see this incredible miracle of a talking donkey – the common knowledge is that donkeys are dumb animals. However we see that the dumb one was the human being, in this case, the donkey's eyes were opened to see the angel – with the drawn sword – the donkey was so good – trying to save Balaam’s life and its own I guess. We so often forget the spiritual realm. There are angels around us – our guardian angel and other angels that protect us.

For he will command his angels concerning you
to guard you in all your ways;
12 they will lift you up in their hands,
so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. Ps 91

The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
and he delivers them. Ps 34

Let us be aware of the lovely angels around us and don’t forget to pet your dog/cat. 😀

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Source of the Law

[![The Source of the Law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day071.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9baaLM4owkY "The Source of the Law")

### Day 71 “If the Lord opens a door no one can close it”

We see Balak just won’t give up, he makes Balaam try again and again. Even though they build multiple alters and offer bulls and rams – the Lord will not change, what is man that he can attempt to change God’s mind/will.

As we live our Christian lives – we will have a lot of resistance, pushback, and even opposition. Do not worry the Lord is on our side, God is fighting for us.

Like Balak and Balaam, anyone against us (God’s chosen people) will have to say.

“He can I curse who God has not cursed” v8

“ Behold I receive a command to bless; he has blessed and I cannot revoke it ”v20 Numbers 23

Remember that nothing will happen to us that the Lord does not allow.

“No weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment You shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from Me,” Says the Lord” (Isaiah 54:17).

Our God is for us and on our side, what can man do.

31 What then are we to say about these things? If God is for us, who is against us? 32 He who did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give us everything else? Rom 8

Just how – no nation could stop God’s people from entering the promised land. No one can close the door the Lord has opened in your life.

“Brave Soldier - Be positive, look up, and move on. He is with us. “

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 71 - Jenita

Living life as a Christian is challenging. Because always seem to be in a battle between our conscience and our desires. Even though we are rooted in God's words we waver from the plan God has for us.

But nothing can stop God's protection over us. So we just need to trust in God and move forward.

### The Plains of Moab

[![The Plains of Moab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day072.jpg)](https://youtu.be/86QY0R3QZ9c "The Plains of Moab")

### Day 72 “Rid yourself, family, and society of sin”

We see how faithful God is to the Israelites. We see the Lord is preventing Balaam from cursing the Israelites, he is unable to curse despite the pressure Balak put on him. The Lord has been leading the Israelites through the wilderness – feeding them and defeating many nations along the way – they are about to enter the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey. The Israelites should be praising God and worshiping Him, however, they are doing awful things to displease the Lord. They are doing shameful things with the Moabite women. Apart from going to the neighboring town one of the sons of Israel even brought a Midianite woman – walked past weeping Moses and Levites – and defiled the inner room of the tent. This would be like performing sexual acts on the altar of a catholic church. Phinehas a priest got up and put them to death and this stopped the plague.

I think the problem today is we have become comfortable with sin. We do not deal with sin as we should, we accept bad behavior and do not correct it. For example – earlier it was shameful for anyone to have sex before marriage or for anyone to live together before marriage. But today – everyone is very casual about the idea of living together before marriage just so that you can know the person and see if they are compatible. I don’t think this is working – look at the divorce rate it is through the roof.

We have become cowardly – if we see our kids doing this, we are afraid to correct them lest they stop talking to us. We are answerable to God; we have failed to correct our children and grandchildren.

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prob 13:24

Also, we tend to be timid with sin in our own lives. Sin can be imagined as a baby serpent – we should be running away from it; however, we keep it in our pocket - and bring it out every little while. One day this small serpent will become a huge anaconda and swallow us up.

Be aware!! Be aware!! of sin.

8 Discipline yourselves, keep alert. Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.1 Pet 5:8

Let us first discipline ourselves, then our children/family and then the society. This will stop the plague of the culture of death.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 73 “Catholic guilt” ###

We read in today’s Psalm about the fear of the Lord.

“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all those who practice it have a good understanding.” Ps111:10

The fear of the Lord is indeed the beginning of wisdom, but what is the fear of the Lord. Am I supposed to be afraid of God, or am I supposed to be afraid of His wrath? Not true, we are not called to fear God, He is a loving and caring God – a God who sent His only son to die for us, the Father who knit us together in our mother’s womb, the Lord who does not slumber but watches over us, the one who knows when we come in and go out when we sit down and raise up, even before a word is on our lips – He knows it. We cannot be afraid of God – His nature is love itself.

What does the “fear of the Lord” mean – it means we should be afraid not to hurt Him who loves us much. We should be fearful to not offend Him, Him who loves us so deeply. We should be fearful to not let Him down, not to betray Him, when we have an opportunity to talk about Him.

The word “Catholics guilt” gets tossed around a lot. Folks tend to say that “Catholics are not even sure of their salvation” – “That they have an over-emphasis on their sin” – and “That they are running to confession all the time” --- All of those are NOT true – absolutely not true.

Catholics are very discerning and reverend people – we are not "a free for all – anything goes" type of people. We are serious about sin we define it very well, the catechism lists out all types of sin – venial and mortal, the deadly sins, the modern terms of sin (for example we have good definitions of sin like abortion, pornography, homosexuality, masturbation, rape, etc ) We are conscious of our sins, we carefully examine our hearts and go to confession. Once we make a confession – we know for a fact that our sins are forgiven – no doubt at all.

“whoever's sins you forgive are forgiven them” Jh 20”23

We come out rejoicing and celebrating – also heaven rejoices over one repented person than over 99 who don't need to.

Usually what people are referring to when they say Catholic guilt is a heresy called “Jansenism” from the 17th and 18th centuries.

Jansenism was an early modern theological movement within Catholicism, primarily active in the Kingdom of France, that emphasized original sin, human depravity, the necessity of divine grace, and predestination. It was declared a heresy by the Catholic Church.

In conclusion, the Catholics are very cognizant of their state of grace – their sin, once confessed it's forgiven and it’s out of the mind and we are a celebrating, rejoicing, and happy people.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 74 “Men and women are equal – both created in God’s image” ###

We see in today’s reading the daughters of Zelophehad - 5 of them came forward to demand equality for inheritance. Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah come up before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

What courage they must have had – to take a stand before the congregation.

“Our father died in the wilderness; he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but died for his own sin; and he had no sons. 4 Why should the name of our father be taken away from his clan because he had no son? Give to us a possession among our father’s brothers.” Numbers 27:3,4

Moses needed to seek God’s guidance on this and sure enough the Lord said – yes Men and women are equal – the daughters should be given their due.

Moses brought their case before the Lord. 6 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 7 The daughters of Zelophehad are right in what they are saying; you shall indeed let them possess an inheritance among their father’s brothers and pass the inheritance of their father on to them. Numbers 27:5-8

When God created man and women – He made no difference between the two. He created them both in His image.

So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. Gen 1:27

In Jesus’ earthly life he always took up for women the widows the orphans. Many women were his followers and supporters. Two of his good friends were Mary and Martha – and their brother Lazarus. Scripture scholars believed that Lazarus was physically challenged or very sick. The Greek word "asthenes" can be translated as "sick," "without strength," "feeble" or "insignificant."

Due to his condition, Lazarus was unable to care for the family and his sisters were not married because they had to care for Lazarus. Jesus loved them so dearly and cared for them – even brought back Lazarus to life.

Our God created everyone equal, men and women, black, white and brown, short, tall, weak, strong, smart, simple, special, normal. Jesus loves us all the same.

Let us stop hate or discrimination – we are called to love as God loves. Love everyone equally.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
