### Complaining in the Desert

[![Complaining in the Desert](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day061.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1VjA7vISyac "Complaining in the Desert")

### Day 61: ‚ÄúComplaint of rebellion‚Äù

We see how the Israelites get tired of eating Manna and complain about it. They remember their times as salves ‚Äì where they had meat and herbs and garlic. They felt that they received all this for free, little did they realize that they were captive slaves. They had been slaves for generations and their mindset was that of slaves, even though they slogged all day to eat a tasty meal, they did not realize it, they thought it was free food.

We can sometimes get into this rut and try to find satisfaction with earthly stuff - food, luxury, comfort, pleasure. All these are just but an icon to the eternal glory we will receive. Just like the Israelites we can become crabby and complain when we do not get the things we are used to.

We can be complaining about the weather, the traffic, the pandemic, our spouse, our kids, our priests, our community. We need to be a people of praise and not a people of complaints and insults. We need to be a people of joy and not ones with crushed spirits.

A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Prov 17:22

Let us have a cheerful spirit and praise and pray instead of complaining.

May the Holy Spirt Lead us üôè

### Spies Sent to Canaan

[![Spies Sent to Canaan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day062.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UmoB_TfaWWo "Spies Sent to Canaan")

### Day 62: ‚ÄúFamily Feud‚Äù

JOKE ALERT: WHAT‚ÄôS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IN-LAWS AND OUTLAWS.
THE OUTLAWS ARE WANTED, AND THE IN-LAWS ARE \_\_\_ üòÅ
We see this played out over and over again, families fighting over petty things. We see sibling rivalry, fights with the in-laws, jealousy, quarrels, disagreement, enmity, family members not talking to each other. We should realize all of us have weaknesses and shortcomings, no one is perfect, and some people are harder to love. We can pick our friends but family is given to us. (well we can pick our spouse and in-laws I guess)
We see Aaron and Miriam, speaking ill of Moses‚Äô wife. They seem to be upset that she is from a different race. The scripture does not think it‚Äôs important to tell us why they were angry/upset with Moses for marrying her. What‚Äôs important is that the Lord is listening to every conversation, he hears all our gossip and complaints. Even before we speak a word He knows it. Whatever we speak in secret will be spoken on the rooftops someday. Be careful how you speak, guard your tongue, and guard your heart. Some people are just so hard to handle because they are reacting out of hidden hurts and wounds. We need to pray for the grace to avoid taking ill of our family lest we will be struck with a disease like Miriam.
However the Lord knows how to unite families, as soon as Miriam got sick ‚Äì the differences disappeared the brothers united ‚Äì Aaron asks Moses to pray, and Moses prays from his heart, let's see what happens next.
Let's take some time to pray for our family and in-laws.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

### Day 62 Anonymous

They are having sibling fights because Moses married a Cushite woman.
In God's sight Moses had done nothing wrong in marrying her, if that was so The Lord would have said something about him.  Moses is innocent.  So The Lord calls all three, and ONLY Miriam is punished. Why?

1. Consequences for our actions.
2. Immediately that unites Aaron and Moses.  All three are united in prayer again.

Moses who had been chosen as The Lord's prophet speaking specifically not only with God but on behalf of God.

The greatest miracle that has ever happened is The Incarnation and Redemption Salvation of the world.

Lord, give us the grace to say yes to You in everything.

Remember what The Lord has done.

### Israel's Rebellion

[![Israel's Rebellion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/March/jpgs/Day063.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0TIAYr9W5pw "Israel's Rebellion")

### Day 63: ‚ÄúSlow to anger and abounding in mercy‚Äù

The Israelites are a rebellious people, they were delivered from the strongest army ‚Äì the Egyptians. God almighty the great ‚ÄòI AM‚Äô is with them, He delivered them from Egypt ‚Äì with supernatural events ‚Äì the plagues, the parting of the Dead Sea, feeding in the desert, and water from the rock. Even though the Lord led them with a mighty hand and an outreached arm, even though the Lord was fighting for them. The Israelites were rebelling over and over again, they were a rebellious people. They even decided to go back to Egypt, they said let us appoint a captain and go back.

Is this not our story, do we not keep drifting away from the Lord. The Lord has done great things in our lives, he has provided us with a good life ‚Äì and if you can read this today ‚Äì you are more fortunate than half the people in the world or maybe even more, as they are so poor that they do not have internet access. We should stop complaining and remember all the sins the Lord delivered us from, this will help us realize how unworthy we are. We should not think of backsliding or the temporary pleasure we had when we committed sins in the past.

Even though we are so fickle-minded and rebellious, and we continuously fall back into our old sins. The Lord is patient ‚Äì He is slow to anger and abounding in mercy.

We cannot mix the old and the new clothes ‚Äì we cannot carry on with old sins and try to pretend that we are holy. The old has gone and the new has come.

‚ÄúNo one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old" Luke 5:36

Remember that the Lord is patient and is waiting for us to change, He has not left us even though we are not worthy, even though we keep going back to the old sins. May the Lord strengthen us and liberate us from our sinful past.

Also want to call out that we see some Israelites not listening to instructions, getting impatience, and wanting to take on the Amalekites and Canaanites on their own intuition ‚Äì they decided to go out on their own strength without taking the Ark of the covenant or without the guidance of the Lord(the pillar smoke and fire) ‚Äì they FAILED ‚Äì the Amalekites and Canaanites came down and defeated them.

We have to listen to the Lord and wait on Him, not take things into our own hands. Just follow the instructions the Lord gives us and it will be good with us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us üôè

### Day 63 Maryanne C.M.

+God Hears every murmur against him, n there is a consequence for the same. Let us not murmur even in our hearts.
+The spies took 40 days and for each day they hd to spend a year in wilderness. Hence the 40years in wanderings.
+Those who hd to return with a strategy to proceed, returned with fear n defeat in their words. Acting on the reports of fear, the Israelites make plans to return to slavery!! Let us not be bogged down by the arrows of fear that the enemy strikes at us, but remain in confident faith like Caleb and Joshua.
+"...they were driven by fear and paralysed by distrust that marked their hearts..." Let us not be driven by fear in our lives, in Jesus' Name.
+"... bcoz they were unwilling to battle their children hd to do the battle..."
+"...let us take up arms against whatever enslaves us..."
\+ There is One Place for Worship.
+"...be careful if you r close to d Tabernacle or temple, you may not just eat whatever kind of meat that u wud like to..." This also pertains to other consumptions too, like what we listen to or watch!
+Deut 12 is more connected to worship than just abt eating.
Amen.üôè

### Day 66: Forbidden forms of worship ‚Äì Magic, horoscopes, fortune-telling

We see the stern warning of the Lord that is given to the Israelites ‚Äì preparing them for entry into the promised land.

‚ÄúWhen you come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, you must not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations. 10 No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, or who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead.‚Äù Deuteronomy 18

There are some practices that have crept into our daily lives without us discerning properly?

One common thing is reading the daily horoscope prediction ‚Äì or following sun signs.

For example ‚Äì Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination. I got a kick out of this description as I am supposedly Aries ;) but It‚Äôs BS üòÄ There are so many Aries who are just the opposite. Hehe.

People read their fortune in the horoscope columns and believe it, or go to a Psychic, tarot card reader, or palm reader. It‚Äôs just like having a sun, moon, or star god, or believing that the stars and creation rule our lives instead of the creator.

Some people use spirit mediums to get solutions or to conjure the dead. There is an increase in satanism and occult practices. Witchcraft, voodoo dolls, and black magic are common in some cultures. They are allowing after-school Satanist clubs now, remember they threw out the 10 commandments and now allow this.

There are also new age practices each person is their own divinity ‚Äì I‚Äôm my own god.

Many people follow superstations as well like ‚Äì black cat crossing your path, touch wood, a horseshoe for good luck, sports superstitions.

All of these are placing our trust in the created things or practices, it's literally telling God that we trust in things of the world rather than in Almighty God.

We are breaking the first commandment the great Shema ‚Äì

‚ÄúHear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might‚Äù" Deut 6

‚ÄúSome trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.‚Äù Ps 20:7

Let us not put our lives and trust in created things, we owe that to the creator.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.üôè
