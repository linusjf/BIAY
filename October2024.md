### BIAY Day 275 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 3:9
*Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “If it will please the king, let a decree be issued to destroy the Jews.”*

The king had promoted Haman to a very high rank, seating him above all his fellow officials. Thereafter all the king’s servants who were at the royal gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, as ordered by the king.

Mordecai, the Jewish guard, was also working under Haman, but he would not kneel and bow down to Haman.  When his colleagues reminded him daily, he explained that, because he was a Jew and in obedience to the commandment given by God (Exodus 20:5), he could not kneel and bow down to anyone except God, even though it was the king’s order (Esther 3:2).  When Haman heard about it his pride was hurt and he was filled with anger.  Thereafter he started on a mission to destroy not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the land (men, women and children), and he made it look like he was destroying all the enemies of the king.

Haman had every reason to rejoice and be content due to his high ranking position in the kingdom, but he allowed pride to rule his life and it ultimately destroyed him and his entire family (Esther 9:7-10).

If we have been promoted in whichever area we serve, let us be careful to ensure that pride does not rule our lives.  Whatever level we have been elevated to, let us always use it to serve others with humility.
