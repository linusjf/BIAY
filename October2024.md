### Esther Becomes Queen

[![Esther Becomes Queen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day275.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mPcKNfRKj8o "Esther Becomes Queen")

### BIAY Day 275 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 3:9
*Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ‚ÄúIf it will please the king, let a decree be issued to destroy the Jews.‚Äù*

The king had promoted Haman to a very high rank, seating him above all his fellow officials. Thereafter all the king‚Äôs servants who were at the royal gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, as ordered by the king.

Mordecai, the Jewish guard, was also working under Haman, but he would not kneel and bow down to Haman.  When his colleagues reminded him daily, he explained that, because he was a Jew and in obedience to the commandment given by God (Exodus 20:5), he could not kneel and bow down to anyone except God, even though it was the king‚Äôs order (Esther 3:2).  When Haman heard about it his pride was hurt and he was filled with anger.  Thereafter he started on a mission to destroy not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the land (men, women and children), and he made it look like he was destroying all the enemies of the king.

Haman had every reason to rejoice and be content due to his high ranking position in the kingdom, but he allowed pride to rule his life and it ultimately destroyed him and his entire family (Esther 9:7-10).

If we have been promoted in whichever area we serve, let us be careful to ensure that pride does not rule our lives.  Whatever level we have been elevated to, let us always use it to serve others with humility.

### Day #275 We live in a broken world

When we read the old testament with this 21st-century lens we cannot help but say that the stuff they did is just wrong. For example, the way the kings treated the queens and the concubines is just wrong.
We read about king Ahasuerus who had these banquets for his ministers, nobles, and governors, the armies of Persia and Media were also present for this really long party which lasted one hundred and eighty days.
When the king was drunk with wine, he ordered that his queen Vashti be brought out so that everyone could admire her beauty, but she refused to come out. Good for her to take a stand against the king ‚Äì even though it cost her the crown.

7 For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, since they will say, ‚ÄòKing Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.‚Äô 18 This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen‚Äôs behavior will rebel against the king‚Äôs officials, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath! 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. 20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.‚Äù
21 This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan proposed; 22 he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, declaring that every man should be master in his own house. Esther 1
In that male-dominated society, women were put down and treated like servants. Queen Vasthi was expelled from the king‚Äôs presence because of her disobedience. They needed to pick a new queen, and there is a process that can make a 21st-century audience sick.
12 The turn came for each girl to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their cosmetic treatment, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women. 13 When the girl went in to the king she was given whatever she asked for to take with her from the harem to the king‚Äôs palace.

Imagine the poor self-image those women would have had if they had to be treated for months together just so that the King can pick them. We can read this saying ‚Äì how corrupt they were but we need to check our own hearts, do we treat each other‚Äôs bodies like objects? In this pornographic age ‚Äì beauty has become ‚Äògod‚Äô ‚Äì both men and women treat their bodies like objects. People classify others based on looks, appearance and style. We have lost the true beauty of the soul. Physical beauty will fade away but a beautiful heart gets more beautiful.
Right from the start, God created both men and women equal and they were both created in the image and likeness of God. God never wanted the Kings to have many wives and concubines. In fact, as we read many times over - God forbid the kings of Israel from having many wives. Most of the Jewish kings met their downfall because of their many wives and their disobedience to God.

Let us thank God for the progress we have made when it comes to respecting women. We in the 21st century may criticize the Old Testament people, but are our hearts clean of corruption?
Do we look at Jesus present in our brothers and sisters?

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Haman's Plan

[![Haman's Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day276.jpg)](https://youtu.be/94bkfSB7XCM "Haman's Plan")

### Day #276 Take a stance for what is right.

Ester 3:1-2 ‚ÄúMordecai Refuses To Honor Haman. Sometime later, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, giving him a higher rank and seating him above all his royal nobles. All the royal officials who were at the king‚Äôs gate would kneel down and render homage to Haman, for that is what the king had ordered to be done toward him. But Mordecai refused to kneel and bow down to him.‚Äù
Mordecai‚Äôs refusal to kneel did not sit well with Haman. Haman came up with a plan to wipe out the Jews. Based on Haman‚Äôs advice King Ahasuerus send out a decree to kill all those who did not abide by the kingdom ordinances, specifically the Jews. King Ahasuerus wants to have peace and tranquility in the kingdom at any cost.
Although we may never need to kill someone who does not agree with us, we may exclude and alienate them. We sometimes like to live in a shell ‚Äì where we allow on those who agree with us or keep things that make us happy. We may want to throw out church teachings, commandments and laws that we don‚Äôt like and live according to what gives ‚Äúus‚Äù peace or makes us happy. We may want to even distance ourselves from people who reveal our truth or who correct us and keep us on track.

A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. Prov 21:6

We sometimes try to get peace from earthly securities like our bank balance, our position in society or influential friends or family. We try to gain a fortune in any way possible by lying or cheating others ‚Äì let us remember this will not bring us peace.
We are willing at times to make a comprise of our faith and beliefs just so that we can fit into society or gain money. Let us learn from Mordecai and take a stance for the truth even if it will cost us something. We will have true peace and deliverance when we stand for the truth and do what is right in the eyes of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 276¬†By Cynthia Dsilva

Nehemiah 8:2‚Äì10
After the Babylonians were defeated by the Persians, King Cyrus of Persia decreed that the Jews who were exiled (from 587 to 537 BC) could return home to Jerusalem.¬† They rebuilt their ruined temple (Ezra 6:15‚Äì17) and under Nehemiah finished rebuilding the city walls (Nehemiah 6:15) around 450 BC.

During this time, God raised Ezra and commissioned him to go to Jerusalem and preach to the people. Ezra was a Scribe and a Priest (v.1, 2 & 9) who had studied the Law at one of the schools of the Jewish Scribes in Babylon.¬† This is first time we hear of a wooden platform (pulpit) in the Temple (v.4).

The Book of Nehemiah gives us a glimpse of the details of the liturgical service of the old Covenant.

Ezra, the Priest, was conducting a liturgical service.¬† He read the Law (the Word of God), it was explained to the congregation, then they celebrated with a sacrificial meal.

This was a prototype or shadow of the liturgical service (the Mass) of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, during the liturgical service the Priest reads the Gospel (the Word of God), explains it to the congregation, teaches them how to apply it to their lives and then they celebrate with the sacrificial meal (Communion).

*Ezra read the Law from early morning to midday (six hours)* (v.3).

The people were so hungry for the Word of God that they didn‚Äôt mind sitting in the Temple for six hours to hear it (v.3).

*When Ezra opened the scroll, all the people stood up* (v.5).

When the Priest reads the Gospel during Mass, the congregation stands to hear the Word of God in reverence because the Priest is reading the message from our God and heavenly King (Jesus).

*At the end of the Reading, the people answered ‚ÄúAmen, amen‚Äù* (v.6).

At the end of the Readings when we give a positive response to the Word of God (v.6) (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ, etc.) we are swearing to God that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7).¬† Saying ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù and doing otherwise means we are breaking our oath.

*After the Law (the Word of God) was read, the Priests interpreted the Law to help the people understand, while the people remained sitting* (v.7-8).

After the 3 readings and Gospel are read in Church, the congregation sits to hear the Priest interpret the Gospel and explain how the New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is revealed in the New, and how we can apply it to our lives.

*When the people heard the Law and the consequences for disobedience, they wept because they realized how far they had gone from God due to no one being available to read the Law to them.¬† They understood that they themselves were responsible for their exile due to their sins (v.9).*

When a person realizes that he/she has been walking in the wrong direction, and repents, it is normal for him/her to cry because that is the time the Holy Spirit is activated and therefore the evil spirits must leave the soul, thus causing some reaction.

*But Ezra and the Levites consoled the people that this was not a time for weeping and grieving. They had renewed their Covenant with God during the liturgical service, so it was a time for rejoicing* (v.9).

In the New Covenant Church also, after our venial sins are forgiven and after we have heard the Word of God and offered the divine sacrifice (the Lamb of God), we are covered with white robes because we have renewed our Covenant with God.¬† It is therefore not a time for us to weep or grieve over our past sins.¬† It is a time for rejoicing with the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal.

*Ezra and the priests advised the people to share the sacrificial meal* (v.10).

In the New Covenant Church also, the priests must ensure to share the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal with those who are not able to attend the liturgical service (the elderly, the sick, the disabled, etc.).¬† However, it is the duty of the lay congregation to inform the priests of any such persons so that Communion can be given to them at their homes.

Although the Judeans rebuilt the Temple, their knowledge of the faith was very poor because there was no one to read the Word of God to them so the people had not heard the Word of God for many years. Moreover, they did not have access to the written Word of God, because copying and printing was not very common in those days.

But 2500 years later, in today‚Äôs world we are blessed to have so many ways to read the Word of God. We have hard copies, online text Bibles, online audio Bibles, etc. So let us not waste this opportunity which God has given us to have access to His Word. Let us make use of it as much as we can before it is too late.

### Such a Time as This

[![Such a Time as This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day277.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z3UE1ws8JtU "Such a Time as This")

### Day #277 Pray hard in times of trouble.

The Jews face being wiped out and there seems to be no way out as King Ahasuerus already passed the ordinance to kill anyone who does not comply. Mordecai is such a good example of not backing off when the enemy threatens. He and the other Jews resort to mourning and prayer.

When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the king‚Äôs gate, for no one might enter the king‚Äôs gate clothed with sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king‚Äôs command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. Esther 4:4

Mordecai also requested that queen Esther make supplications on behalf of the Jews. However it was not permitted for queen Ester to approach the king unless she was called. In that province, if anyone went to the King without being called they could face death.
This information did not deter Mordecai, he went on to remind Queen Esther.

‚ÄúDo not think that in the king‚Äôs palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father‚Äôs family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.‚Äù Esther 4:13,14

This advice gave Esther courage and she agreed to this difficult calling.
‚ÄúGo, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.‚Äù Esther 4:16

When we face tough situations we may want to run away or ignore it, but we should pray hard and face them instead. We should not just think about ourselves but about everyone else as well. We may be filled with fear but we should surrender our fear to the Lord and realize our current position and calling in life, maybe we were born for such a time as this. Maybe God has put us in a position so that we can help God‚Äôs people. Let us not fear to take a stand for the truth, even if it may cost our lives. We cannot do it on our own, we have to pray and surrender like Esther who prayed for 3 days before she approached the King.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
