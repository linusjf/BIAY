### Esther Becomes Queen

[![Esther Becomes Queen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day275.jpg)](https://youtu.be/mPcKNfRKj8o "Esther Becomes Queen")

### BIAY Day 275 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 3:9
*Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, ‚ÄúIf it will please the king, let a decree be issued to destroy the Jews.‚Äù*

The king had promoted Haman to a very high rank, seating him above all his fellow officials. Thereafter all the king‚Äôs servants who were at the royal gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, as ordered by the king.

Mordecai, the Jewish guard, was also working under Haman, but he would not kneel and bow down to Haman.  When his colleagues reminded him daily, he explained that, because he was a Jew and in obedience to the commandment given by God (Exodus 20:5), he could not kneel and bow down to anyone except God, even though it was the king‚Äôs order (Esther 3:2).  When Haman heard about it his pride was hurt and he was filled with anger.  Thereafter he started on a mission to destroy not only Mordecai but all the Jews in the land (men, women and children), and he made it look like he was destroying all the enemies of the king.

Haman had every reason to rejoice and be content due to his high ranking position in the kingdom, but he allowed pride to rule his life and it ultimately destroyed him and his entire family (Esther 9:7-10).

If we have been promoted in whichever area we serve, let us be careful to ensure that pride does not rule our lives.  Whatever level we have been elevated to, let us always use it to serve others with humility.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

### Day #275 We live in a broken world

When we read the old testament with this 21st-century lens we cannot help but say that the stuff they did is just wrong. For example, the way the kings treated the queens and the concubines is just wrong.
We read about king Ahasuerus who had these banquets for his ministers, nobles, and governors, the armies of Persia and Media were also present for this really long party which lasted one hundred and eighty days.
When the king was drunk with wine, he ordered that his queen Vashti be brought out so that everyone could admire her beauty, but she refused to come out. Good for her to take a stand against the king ‚Äì even though it cost her the crown.

7 For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, since they will say, ‚ÄòKing Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.‚Äô 18 This very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen‚Äôs behavior will rebel against the king‚Äôs officials, and there will be no end of contempt and wrath! 19 If it pleases the king, let a royal order go out from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she. 20 So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low alike.‚Äù
21 This advice pleased the king and the officials, and the king did as Memucan proposed; 22 he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, declaring that every man should be master in his own house. Esther 1
In that male-dominated society, women were put down and treated like servants. Queen Vasthi was expelled from the king‚Äôs presence because of her disobedience. They needed to pick a new queen, and there is a process that can make a 21st-century audience sick.
12 The turn came for each girl to go in to King Ahasuerus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their cosmetic treatment, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics for women. 13 When the girl went in to the king she was given whatever she asked for to take with her from the harem to the king‚Äôs palace.

Imagine the poor self-image those women would have had if they had to be treated for months together just so that the King can pick them. We can read this saying ‚Äì how corrupt they were but we need to check our own hearts, do we treat each other‚Äôs bodies like objects? In this pornographic age ‚Äì beauty has become ‚Äògod‚Äô ‚Äì both men and women treat their bodies like objects. People classify others based on looks, appearance and style. We have lost the true beauty of the soul. Physical beauty will fade away but a beautiful heart gets more beautiful.
Right from the start, God created both men and women equal and they were both created in the image and likeness of God. God never wanted the Kings to have many wives and concubines. In fact, as we read many times over - God forbid the kings of Israel from having many wives. Most of the Jewish kings met their downfall because of their many wives and their disobedience to God.

Let us thank God for the progress we have made when it comes to respecting women. We in the 21st century may criticize the Old Testament people, but are our hearts clean of corruption?
Do we look at Jesus present in our brothers and sisters?

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Haman's Plan

[![Haman's Plan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day276.jpg)](https://youtu.be/94bkfSB7XCM "Haman's Plan")

### Day #276 Take a stance for what is right.

Ester 3:1-2 ‚ÄúMordecai Refuses To Honor Haman. Sometime later, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, giving him a higher rank and seating him above all his royal nobles. All the royal officials who were at the king‚Äôs gate would kneel down and render homage to Haman, for that is what the king had ordered to be done toward him. But Mordecai refused to kneel and bow down to him.‚Äù
Mordecai‚Äôs refusal to kneel did not sit well with Haman. Haman came up with a plan to wipe out the Jews. Based on Haman‚Äôs advice King Ahasuerus send out a decree to kill all those who did not abide by the kingdom ordinances, specifically the Jews. King Ahasuerus wants to have peace and tranquility in the kingdom at any cost.
Although we may never need to kill someone who does not agree with us, we may exclude and alienate them. We sometimes like to live in a shell ‚Äì where we allow on those who agree with us or keep things that make us happy. We may want to throw out church teachings, commandments and laws that we don‚Äôt like and live according to what gives ‚Äúus‚Äù peace or makes us happy. We may want to even distance ourselves from people who reveal our truth or who correct us and keep us on track.

A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. Prov 21:6

We sometimes try to get peace from earthly securities like our bank balance, our position in society or influential friends or family. We try to gain a fortune in any way possible by lying or cheating others ‚Äì let us remember this will not bring us peace.
We are willing at times to make a comprise of our faith and beliefs just so that we can fit into society or gain money. Let us learn from Mordecai and take a stance for the truth even if it will cost us something. We will have true peace and deliverance when we stand for the truth and do what is right in the eyes of God.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 276¬†By Cynthia Dsilva

Nehemiah 8:2‚Äì10
After the Babylonians were defeated by the Persians, King Cyrus of Persia decreed that the Jews who were exiled (from 587 to 537 BC) could return home to Jerusalem.¬† They rebuilt their ruined temple (Ezra 6:15‚Äì17) and under Nehemiah finished rebuilding the city walls (Nehemiah 6:15) around 450 BC.

During this time, God raised Ezra and commissioned him to go to Jerusalem and preach to the people. Ezra was a Scribe and a Priest (v.1, 2 & 9) who had studied the Law at one of the schools of the Jewish Scribes in Babylon.¬† This is first time we hear of a wooden platform (pulpit) in the Temple (v.4).

The Book of Nehemiah gives us a glimpse of the details of the liturgical service of the old Covenant.

Ezra, the Priest, was conducting a liturgical service.¬† He read the Law (the Word of God), it was explained to the congregation, then they celebrated with a sacrificial meal.

This was a prototype or shadow of the liturgical service (the Mass) of the new Covenant.

In the new Covenant, during the liturgical service the Priest reads the Gospel (the Word of God), explains it to the congregation, teaches them how to apply it to their lives and then they celebrate with the sacrificial meal (Communion).

*Ezra read the Law from early morning to midday (six hours)* (v.3).

The people were so hungry for the Word of God that they didn‚Äôt mind sitting in the Temple for six hours to hear it (v.3).

*When Ezra opened the scroll, all the people stood up* (v.5).

When the Priest reads the Gospel during Mass, the congregation stands to hear the Word of God in reverence because the Priest is reading the message from our God and heavenly King (Jesus).

*At the end of the Reading, the people answered ‚ÄúAmen, amen‚Äù* (v.6).

At the end of the Readings when we give a positive response to the Word of God (v.6) (Amen, thanks be to God, praise to you Lord Jesus Christ, etc.) we are swearing to God that we will live by it, just as the ancient Israelites did (Exodus 24:7).¬† Saying ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù and doing otherwise means we are breaking our oath.

*After the Law (the Word of God) was read, the Priests interpreted the Law to help the people understand, while the people remained sitting* (v.7-8).

After the 3 readings and Gospel are read in Church, the congregation sits to hear the Priest interpret the Gospel and explain how the New Testament is hidden in the Old, and the Old Testament is revealed in the New, and how we can apply it to our lives.

*When the people heard the Law and the consequences for disobedience, they wept because they realized how far they had gone from God due to no one being available to read the Law to them.¬† They understood that they themselves were responsible for their exile due to their sins (v.9).*

When a person realizes that he/she has been walking in the wrong direction, and repents, it is normal for him/her to cry because that is the time the Holy Spirit is activated and therefore the evil spirits must leave the soul, thus causing some reaction.

*But Ezra and the Levites consoled the people that this was not a time for weeping and grieving. They had renewed their Covenant with God during the liturgical service, so it was a time for rejoicing* (v.9).

In the New Covenant Church also, after our venial sins are forgiven and after we have heard the Word of God and offered the divine sacrifice (the Lamb of God), we are covered with white robes because we have renewed our Covenant with God.¬† It is therefore not a time for us to weep or grieve over our past sins.¬† It is a time for rejoicing with the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal.

*Ezra and the priests advised the people to share the sacrificial meal* (v.10).

In the New Covenant Church also, the priests must ensure to share the sacrificial (Eucharistic) meal with those who are not able to attend the liturgical service (the elderly, the sick, the disabled, etc.).¬† However, it is the duty of the lay congregation to inform the priests of any such persons so that Communion can be given to them at their homes.

Although the Judeans rebuilt the Temple, their knowledge of the faith was very poor because there was no one to read the Word of God to them so the people had not heard the Word of God for many years. Moreover, they did not have access to the written Word of God, because copying and printing was not very common in those days.

But 2500 years later, in today‚Äôs world we are blessed to have so many ways to read the Word of God. We have hard copies, online text Bibles, online audio Bibles, etc. So let us not waste this opportunity which God has given us to have access to His Word. Let us make use of it as much as we can before it is too late.

### Such a Time as This

[![Such a Time as This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day277.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z3UE1ws8JtU "Such a Time as This")

### Day #277 Pray hard in times of trouble.

The Jews face being wiped out and there seems to be no way out as King Ahasuerus already passed the ordinance to kill anyone who does not comply. Mordecai is such a good example of not backing off when the enemy threatens. He and the other Jews resort to mourning and prayer.

When Mordecai learned all that had been done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went through the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry; 2 he went up to the entrance of the king‚Äôs gate, for no one might enter the king‚Äôs gate clothed with sackcloth. In every province, wherever the king‚Äôs command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes. Esther 4:4

Mordecai also requested that queen Esther make supplications on behalf of the Jews. However it was not permitted for queen Ester to approach the king unless she was called. In that province, if anyone went to the King without being called they could face death.
This information did not deter Mordecai, he went on to remind Queen Esther.

‚ÄúDo not think that in the king‚Äôs palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews. 14 For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father‚Äôs family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to royal dignity for just such a time as this.‚Äù Esther 4:13,14

This advice gave Esther courage and she agreed to this difficult calling.
‚ÄúGo, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. After that I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.‚Äù Esther 4:16

When we face tough situations we may want to run away or ignore it, but we should pray hard and face them instead. We should not just think about ourselves but about everyone else as well. We may be filled with fear but we should surrender our fear to the Lord and realize our current position and calling in life, maybe we were born for such a time as this. Maybe God has put us in a position so that we can help God‚Äôs people. Let us not fear to take a stand for the truth, even if it may cost our lives. We cannot do it on our own, we have to pray and surrender like Esther who prayed for 3 days before she approached the King.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Esther 6:1-11

Mordecai was not given honor for saving the King's life (Esther 2:21-23) but Mordecai being a humble man, did not complain or do anything to remind the king about it.¬† He continued doing his gatekeeper‚Äôs duty and focused on worshipping the living God and would not let anyone change that for him. God saw his heart for almost 7 years and then took the necessary action to shower Mordecai with blessings.

God allowed Haman to make the ungodly command that all his subordinates must kneel and bow down to him, because God wanted to test Mordecai's faithfulness.

God allows the ungodly ones to make evil plots against His people to spiritually heal the good ones or to glorify the holy ones.

For the Lord will raise the humble, but the haughty eyes He will bring down. (Psalm 18:27).

When we obey the devil our physical destruction may or may not happen but our eternal destruction is definite.

We get whatever we give others and whatever we wish for others.

Let us therefore spread love and compassion, wherever we go, and wish the prosperity of others.

Let us avoid spreading anger, hatred and envy, and wishing the destruction of others.

Esther 6:13
*Haman‚Äôs wife and friends said to him, ‚ÄúIf Mordecai, before whom your downfall has begun, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him, but will surely fall before him.‚Äù*

He, who had planned the destruction of God‚Äôs faithful people and their families, himself met with destruction along with his family.

God has sent each one of His chosen people to the earth with a mission, but Satan always stirs up his disciples to plant obstacles or to destroy the mission.¬† Those who plot to destroy God's people before His mission is accomplished, will meet their own destruction.¬† It is for God to decide when we should leave the earth. Satan cannot destroy us (body and soul) if we allow God to control our lives and remain obedient to His commandments.¬† That is not a guarantee for a long life.¬† It just means that we will have sufficient time to accomplish the mission which God assigned to us for the growth of His Kingdom on earth (the Church), and God will be with us all the way through.

When God is for us, no one can be against us (Romans 8:31), and no weapon fashioned against us shall prosper (Isaiah 54:17), but God will be for us only if we obey Him.

### Power in Weakness

[![Power in Weakness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day278.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z-VCoqUsnS0 "Power in Weakness")

### Day #278 When we are weak He is strong.

After praying for 3 days, Queen Esther surrendered everything to God and went to meet the king adorned in splendor.

‚Äú She was radiant with perfect beauty, and she looked happy, as if beloved, but her heart was frozen with fear. 6 When she had gone through all the doors, she stood before the king. He was seated on his royal throne, clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones. He was most terrifying.
7 Lifting his face, flushed with splendor, he looked at her in fierce anger. The queen faltered, and turned pale and faint, and collapsed on the head of the maid who went in front of her. 8 Then God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself. He comforted her with soothing words, and said to her, 9 ‚ÄúWhat is it, Esther? I am your husband. Take courage; 10 You shall not die, for our law applies only to our subjects. Come near.‚Äù Esther 15:5-10

God came to her assistance and saved Queen Esther, what her beauty could not do God did. Had the Lord not intervened and changed the heart of the King, Queen Esther would have lost her life as that was the law of the Kingdom that anyone who appears before the king without his permission would die.

We can be assured that the God who saved Queen Esther and the Israelites will also save us. We need to trust in God and surrender every situation to his providence. God will come through when our earthly ability and strength fails. He will never let us suffer beyond our ability. When we are weak He is strong, His grace is sufficient for us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè

### BIAY Day 278 By Cynthia Dsilva

Esther 8:8
*The king said to Queen Esther, ‚ÄúYou may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king‚Äôs ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king‚Äôs ring cannot be revoked.‚Äù*

Haman managed to convince the king that all the Jews must be destroyed because they were not obeying the king‚Äôs laws and therefore there was no reason for the king to tolerate them (Esther 3:8-9); and the king agreed.  Haman did this to take revenge on Mordecai for not bowing down to him (Esther 3:5-6).

When we are in the midst of a negative and difficult situation we are usually faced with a difficult choice; one would be God‚Äôs way and the other would be the devil‚Äôs way.  God does not intervene in the situation until we make our choice according to His Will.

If we choose to follow God‚Äôs way, irrespective of what the consequences may be, only then God will intervene and steer the situation in our favor according to His plan.
If we choose to go the devil‚Äôs way, then God will NOT intervene and we will meet our destruction, if not in this world then definitely in the next world.

When the people of Israel were going to face a death penalty, Esther was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let her people die, OR
2. to risk her life to save her nation.

Esther made an unselfish choice.  She knew that if she went to the king‚Äôs inner court without being called by the king, she could be put to death (Esther 4:11).  Esther, however, did not care about her own comfort and safety.  She decided she would risk her life to save her nation.  She chose Option 2 (Esther 4:16).  God was pleased and intervened to save her nation from annihilation.  As a result many non-Jews converted to Judaism (Esther 8:17).

If Esther had chosen Option 1, then she may have been safe temporarily, but eventually she too would have perished along with her people according to the decree.

But this was only a shadow of the new Covenant.

When the world was going to face the eternal death penalty (Hell), due to original sin, Mary was faced with a difficult decision:

1. to save her life and let the world perish, OR
2. to risk her life to save the world.

Like Esther, Mary made an unselfish choice.  She chose option 2.
Mary risked her life to bear a child when she was still unmarried, knowing that she could be stoned to death according to the Mosaic Law.  But Mary did not care about her own comfort and safety.  She was more concerned about the redemption of the world and she knew how important it was for God.  She therefore chose to do God‚Äôs Will.  God was pleased and intervened to send an angel to speak to Joseph to accept Mary as his wife so that she could be saved from being stoned.  Thereafter God sent His Son to save the world from eternal damnation.  As a result many Jews and non-Jews converted to Christianity.

If we are faced with a difficult decision to choose between benefits or safety of ourselves and that of others, let us make unselfish choices, like Esther and Mary, so that we may be blessed along with the others.

*Thank you, mamma Mary, for your unconditional ‚Äúyes.*‚Äù

### Blessings and Burdens

[![Blessings and Burdens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day279.jpg)](https://youtu.be/opplObEb-fE "Blessings and Burdens")

### Day #279 Live life in moderation.

We live in a consumeristic and materialistic world today, where everyone is in a race to get the best. Most of the conversations revolve around the best cars, gadgets, makeup, and house. People boast about the holidays they took or how much they spent on destination weddings. This generation wants the most extravagant experiences, the most lavish travel, comfort and luxuries are all we seek after. We want to satisfy all the senses and are focused on this world more than eternal life.

Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.
18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the unfaithful for the upright.
19 Better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.
20 The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. Prov 21:17-20

Today‚Äôs proverb helps us keep our appetites in check, we should not be lovers of pleasure if not we will end up becoming poor ‚Äì both financially and spiritually. It‚Äôs better to live in a desert than with a spouse who wants materialistic stuff and keeps on nagging and complaining until it's provided, BTW it‚Äôs not just the wife who nags. ü§£

The wise store up riches and save for the future, the foolish burn holes in their credit cards and get into debt. We should learn from the St Benedict and live a balanced life.
St. Benedict also displayed a spirit of moderation. His monks are allowed clothes suited to the climate, sufficient food and sufficient sleep (7 1/2‚Äì8 hours). The working day is divided into three roughly equal portions: five to six hours of liturgical and other prayer; five hours of manual work, whether domestic work, craft work, garden work, or fieldwork; and four hours reading of the Scriptures and spiritual writings. This balance of prayer, work, and study is another of Benedict‚Äôs
Let us be like wise people, work-eat-live-sleep-save-spend in moderation. Love the Lord and our families in excess, build up treasures for ourselves that moths and rust can‚Äôt destroy.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day #280 Days of Remembrance

Most human beings have a problem of forgetting, we forget birthdays and anniversaries. Apart from forgetting dates we even forget the blessings, mercies, and love of the Lord. We should consider ourselves blessed as the mother church reminds us of the important things. We have feast days, memorials, solemnities, and Holy days of obligation. We have ordinary times and then we have Seasons like Advent, Lent, Easter, and Christmas. If we ever wondered why they were needed every year, one answer could be to help us remember and another answer could be so that we can go deeper in our understanding and love of them.
The Catholic church did not invent this process of remembering things, we just do as the Jewish people did. The feasts and memorials were set up as per God‚Äôs direction.
We read about the feast of `Purim` which reminds them of God‚Äôs intervention, God saved His people, rescued them from death and vindicated them.
So the next them we feel that repeating feasts and seasons is redundant let us dig deeper and immerse ourselves more and more into the life of the church, the sacraments, and the liturgy.
Didn‚Äôt Jesus as us to remember Him in the breaking of the bread?
And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‚ÄúThis is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù Luke 22:19

Even the followers of Jesus devoted themselves to remembering the Lord in the Eucharist and in the teachings of the Lord.
They devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. Acts 2:42
Hope this inspires all of us to frequent the sacraments and study his word more.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Good and Evil

[![Good and Evil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day281.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NWGQu2xBNqU "Good and Evil")

### Day #281 Does God really love us?

There are some fundamental questions that every human being across every generation asks of God. Even though the Bible has a lot of verses on God‚Äôs love we tend to doubt His love.
‚ÄúI have loved you,‚Äù says the Lord.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have you loved us?‚Äô Malachi 1:2

The world would say, ‚ÄúIf God loves us He would let us do what we want‚Äù Or ‚ÄúIf God loves us he would not let any suffering come into the world‚Äù. We need to realize that God has a plan for us a plan for us to be united with Him, for even if we have everything we want in this world we will not be satisfied we will only be satisfied if we rest in God.
Instead of serving that Lord with all their hearts, the priest at the time of prophet Malachi were corrupt and defiled the worship of God.

‚ÄúIt is you priests who show contempt for my name.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have we shown contempt for your name?‚Äô
7 ‚ÄúBy offering defiled food on my altar.
‚ÄúBut you ask, ‚ÄòHow have we defiled you?‚Äô Malachi 1:6

It‚Äôs not just the priests but also marriages were not kept sacred. First of all the people were marrying foreign wives and the children were learning idol worship. Also, divorce was rampant and immortality was on the rise.
For I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and covering one‚Äôs garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So take heed to yourselves and do not be faithless. Malachi 2:16

It seemed that humanity would never be able to redeem itself as we had dug ourselves into this rabbit hole of selfishness.

The last prophet before John the Baptist, Malachi reveals God‚Äôs plan to redeem humanity.

5 Lo, I will send you the prophet Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes. 6 He will turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse. Mal 4:5

Here is the prophecy of John the Baptist and his role in preparing the way of the Lord. John proclaims that the Kingdom of God is at hand, that the redeemer of the world is coming with healing in his wings, that the sun of righteousness will rise and we will have a new covenant with holy priest offering a holy Sacrifice of the Mass and with Marriages where there is love and holiness.
The question we need to ask ourselves is ‚ÄúHas the world really changed, does my life reflect God‚Äôs love, are our priests serving the Lord with a pure heart, are marriages holy, is there divorce today because we read from Malachi that God hates divorce.‚Äù
Let us prepare for the second coming of Christ, the Church asks us to prepare for it every time we are called to repentance. We hear John the Baptist cry to prepare the way of the Lord every Advent and Lent. Let those who have ears hear!!!

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

Malachi 2:1-3
*And now, O priests, this command is for you.  If you will not listen, if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, then I will send the curse on you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.  I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my presence.*

God was warning the priests because His priesthood was defiled.
God was also warning the married couples because the priests of the old Covenant were married men and, along with their priesthood, their marriages were also defiled.
Like marriage, the Covenant with the priesthood was to be a lifetime bond, but the priests had become lukewarm in their duties. They compromised with the Word of God to please the people.
This was a warning for all priests unto the end of time.

If the priests continue in their ungodly practices then God will discard them from His Kingdom like the dung from the sin offerings (Exodus 29:14).

Malachi 3:1
*Behold, I send my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts.*

Just as God sent an angel before Israel to prepare the way and lead them in their exodus toward the promised land (Exodus 23:20) so also God promised to send a messenger of the Covenant, the new Elijah (John the Baptist), to prepare the way by turning the hearts of the people to the Father before the coming of the new Israel (Jesus) who would lead His people in the new exodus (Mark/1/2) towards the promised land (Heaven).

Jesus suddenly came to His Temple, without any public announcement, on the days He was to be circumcised and presented, and Simeon & Anna recognized Him (Luke 2:21-38).

Malachi 3:13-15
*You have spoken harsh words against me, says the LORD.*
*You ask, ‚ÄúWhat have we spoken against you?‚Äù*
*You have said, ‚ÄúIt is useless to serve God; what do we gain by observing God‚Äôs requirements, and by going about as mourners before the LORD of hosts?  We call the arrogant blessed; for evildoers not only prosper but even test God and escape.‚Äù*

Like those people, we too can get caught up in the circle of questioning God when things are constantly going wrong in our lives, inspite of obeying God always, while the ungodly ones seem to be prospering.

### Day 282 Patient Endurance

Life can be tough and we will have many opportunities to lose our cool. We can get angry and frustrated, resulting in hasty decisions or even harmful actions. We read some wise words from Sirach which can help us in times of anger.

Unjust anger cannot be justified, for anger tips the scale to one‚Äôs ruin. Those who are patient stay calm until the right moment, and then cheerfulness comes back to them. They hold back their words until the right moment; then the lips of many tell of their good sense. Sirach 1:22-24

We need to be patient and clam and wait for the right moment which is easier said than done. The Fear of the Lord can help us in times of anguish.

For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline, fidelity and humility are his delight. Sirach 1:27
The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish Sirach 1:18

The fear of the Lord is glory and exultation, and gladness and a crown of rejoicing. 12 The fear of the Lord delights the heart, and gives gladness and joy and long life. Sirach 1: 11-13

The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a haughty person will find it hard to experience wisdom. The Fear of the Lord isn‚Äôt us getting afraid of God but it‚Äôs being afraid of offending the Lord with our sin. The next time we get angry imagine that Jesus is there in place of the person we are angry with and see if we are able to say the same things to them.
The Fear of the Lord drives out all fear of the world. Like some of the Jews that we read about in 1 Maccabees who did not fear being persecuted. Alexander the great died and gave his 4 generals authority, they wanted to setup pagan religions and forced the Jews to accept it. Some Jews gladly accepted it while other decided to endure the suffering they were put to, suffering unto death.
We are called to be people of patient endurance. We are to love the Fear of the Lord so we will be able overcome the fear of the world.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Mattathias Attacks

[![Mattathias Attacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day283.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Hb1pUfIbetw "Mattathias Attacks")

### Day #283 Zeal and righteous anger

THROUGH THE GENERATIONS THERE ARE SO MANY HEROES IN THE BIBLE WHO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, THE ZEAL FOR THE LAW OR FOR THE HOUSE OF THE LORD CONSUMES THEM AND THEY ARE FILLED WITH RIGHTEOUS ANGER. WE SEE ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IN MATTATHIAS, A PRIEST WHO SAW THE BLASPHEMIES BEING COMMITTED BY SOME OF THE JEWS UNDER THE GREEK RULE. IN ORDER TO PLEASE THE KING AND HAVE A GOOD LIFE THEY DECIDED TO PARTAKE IN PAGAN WORSHIP.
The King's officers who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town where Mattathias lived and suggested that he partake in the pagan worship.
‚ÄúYou are a leader, honored and great in this town, and supported by sons and brothers. 18 Now be the first to come and do what the king commands, as all the nations and the people of Judah and those who are left in Jerusalem have done. Then you and your sons will be numbered among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.‚Äù 1 Maccabees 2:17-18

Mattathias would not cave in to such temptations but the zeal within him would grow stronger.

9 But Mattathias answered and said in a loud voice: ‚ÄúEven if all the nations that live under the rule of the king obey him and have chosen to obey his commandments, every one of them abandoning the religion of their ancestors, 20 I and my sons and my brothers will continue to live by the covenant of our ancestors. 21 Far be it from us to desert the law and the ordinances. 22 We will not obey the king‚Äôs words by turning aside from our religion to the right hand or to the left.‚Äù
23 When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein, according to the king‚Äôs command. 24 When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal, and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and slaughtered him on the altar. 25 At the same time he killed the king‚Äôs officer who was forcing them to sacrifice, and he tore down the altar. 26 Thus he burned with zeal for the law, just as Phinehas did against Zimri son of Salu. 1 Maccabees 2: 9-26

Let us try to put ourselves in his shoes or one second, would we cave in or run away or would we fight like him. He was fearless and did not let any pressures or temptations of the world deter him, he was filled with righteous anger. Does this not remind you of Jesus cleansing of the temple of the money changers.
‚Äúzeal for your house will consume me‚Äù in John 2:17

Then Mattathias cried out in the town with a loud voice, saying: ‚ÄúLet everyone who is zealous for the law and supports the covenant come out with me!‚Äù 28 Then he and his sons fled to the hills and left all that they had in the town. At that time many who were seeking righteousness and justice went down to the wilderness to live there, 30 they, their sons, their wives, and their livestock, because troubles pressed heavily upon them. Maccabees 2:27-30

Mattathias was that spark the set the fire of Zeal in many people and they were able to withstand the persecution, even fight for the right of worship.
May we be feel inspired to take a stance for the Lord, may the zeal of righteous anger fill our hearts and minds as we read these stories of these heroes in the Bible.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

## BIAY Day 283 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Maccabees 2:15-22
It would have been more easier for Mattathias and his family to maintain their peace and become wealthy by obeying the evil king.  But they chose to obey the true heavenly King and resist the earthly king so they revolted against Antiochus and eventually won the battle 3 years later.

Let us make sure that we too have the same zeal for the Lord so that we resist evil even if it means we have to give up our wealth and comfort.

1 Maccabees 2:62
*Do not fear the words of sinners, for their splendour will turn into dung and worms.*
Whenever we receive hurtful comments (criticism, humiliation, threats, etc.) from others, let us remember that there is a Word of God for us.
We must just brush off any type of comment that hurts or wounds us, for these are the words of those who obey the evil one and they have no power over us.  If we are still holding onto hurtful words, let us let-go and pray for the person who used them. Their words will never have any impact on us, and their words will never have authority over us.  We are children of God, so we need not fear the words of sinners.

Sirach 4:26
*Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, and do not try to stop the current of a river.*
A flowing river is a symbol of God‚Äôs flowing grace.  When we don't confess our sins we block the inward flow of grace into our lives.  An honest confession opens the floodgates of Heaven.

### Near Occasion of Sin

[![Near Occasion of Sin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day284.jpg)](https://youtu.be/34gZvSG-cTk "Near Occasion of Sin")

### Day 284 Guard yourself against lust and avoid the near occasion of Sin.

Sirach has some good advice for anyone struggling with the sin of lust. It seems to be addressing a man but as we know most of the Bible is written with a masculine perspective but that was just how things were written back then. This advice is relevant for both genders, especially in our modern-day lifestyle. And Sirach was a book written by a father to his son, giving him a lot of advice about living a virtuous life.

Do not go near a loose woman,
or you may fall into her snares.
4 Do not dally with a female singer,
or you may be caught in her activities.
5 Do not look intently at a virgin,
or you may stumble and incur penalties for her.
6 Do not give yourself to prostitutes,
or you may lose your inheritance.
7 Do not look around in the streets of a city
or wander about in its deserted sections.
8 Turn away your eyes from a shapely woman,
and do not gaze at beauty belonging to another;
many have been seduced by a woman‚Äôs beauty,
and by it passion is kindled like a fire.
9 Never dine with another man‚Äôs wife
or revel with her at wine,
or your heart may turn aside to her,
and in blood you may plunge into destruction. Sirach 9:3-9

There advice given to us here is very practical and apt to the lifestyle that is portrayed in Media. Many TV soaps and movies portray extra marital affairs as glorious and pre-marital live in relationships a norm. Scenes like ‚Äúa man and women walk into a bar meet for the first time and end up in bed‚Äù, has caused the younger generation to think that has perverted the marital act as a pleasure seeking activity.
Unlike the times when Sirach was written where people had to go out in the streets to look for opportunities to lust, our generation has this at the finger tips ‚Äì the internet has allowed for anyone to access any content they wish. As parents and guardians we need to setup parental controls and boundaries for our younger eyes. Not just the younger eyes but for everyone, we are to avoid the near occasion of sin.

There is some good advice for married people as well to avoid wine and dine with other women or another mans wives or another woman‚Äôs husband.

9 Never dine with another man‚Äôs wife
or revel with her at wine,
or your heart may turn aside to her,
and in blood you may plunge into destruction. Sir 9:9

The Media is polluting minds by showing martial affairs as desirable, and cheating seems to be prevalent. This has caused a high divorce rate and society has made it the norm, re-marrying does not seem to help as people end up trying a few marriages and then finally give up on the idea of marriage.
Many good willing married people seem to fall into the trap of prostitution just because they did not guard themselves well. The advice ‚Äúto not go near loose women ‚Äú from Sirach is apt as no man or woman in an intoxicated state when given an opportunity to indulge in sexual activity can resist. Even the most good willing spouse will succumb to this temptation because we are all weak human beings and the flesh is very weak. The only way is to pray and avoid these evil opportunities.
The next time someone invites you to a party where you know there is a lot of drinking or to a bar that is in a shady part of town, just politely decline.
But always remember God‚Äôs Mercy is available to you if feel convicted of any sin in your thoughts, words, or deeds. Like we pray in the act of contrition ‚Äì let us avoid the near occasion of sin.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Story of Hanukkah

[![Story of Hanukkah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day285.jpg)](https://youtu.be/JZCJsc-Lt-E "Story of Hanukkah")

### Day 285 Do not be boastful.

We can sometime become boastful about the stuff we have or our accomplishments. Almost every commercial is encouraging us to buy a better car, house or appliances. In order to keep up with the world we are trying to get slimmer, prettier, better hair or skin.
You must have heard the term ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù ‚Äì loosely put - people are doing something in order to show that they have as much money as other people, rather than because they really want to do it. Many have gone to their ruin because of keeping up with others. Instead we should just live by our means and not compare with our neighbor.
Do not make a display of your wisdom when you do your work,
and do not extol yourself when you are in difficulty.
Better those who work and have plenty
than those who boast and lack bread.
My child, honor yourself with humility
and give yourself the esteem you deserve. Sirach 10:26-28

Let us not make a display of our accomplishments but clothe ourselves with humility instead. They say pride goes before a fall, so stay humble and give the glory to God.
We also should not honor people who are rich or good good-looking or popular but those who fear the Lord and live a life of faith.
Do not praise individuals for their good looks or loathe anyone because of appearance alone. Sir 11:2

Many rulers have been utterly disgraced, and the honored have been handed over to others. Sir 11:6

We should not praise and honor only those in power or the rich and popular so the Lord can change their fortunes overnight. Instead praise those who fear the Lord or serve the poor, like Mother Teresa or any other saint that only honors God.
Whose offspring are worthy of honor? Those who fear the Lord.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Battle to Choose God

[![The Battle to Choose God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day286.jpg)](https://youtu.be/0OxsyVxbCEM "The Battle to Choose God")

### Day 286 Self-care is choosing Life.

In the race of life, some people end up sacrificing a lot of their lives in the pursuit of making it big in life. Some have a good intention to make life easy for their kids and end up depriving themselves of a good life.
Whoever accumulates by depriving himself, accumulates for others; and others will live in luxury on his goods.
If a man is mean to himself, to whom will he be generous? He will not enjoy his own riches. Sirach 14:4,5
We should have a good balance between saving and spending, without overdoing either of them. We should take good care of our health as well, many people neglect their health and work 2 or 3 jobs to increase their wealth. Also, we have made our lives overly busy with many unwanted things. We set very high living standards for ourselves and end up struggling to pay off our debt.
My son treat yourself well, according to your means, and present worthy offerings to the Lord. Sirach 14: 11
It‚Äôs easier said than done, we should spend according to our means. If we could just follow this simple rule in life, we would never be envious or jealous of others.
Do not lift a weight too heavy for you,
or associate with anyone wealthier than you.
How can the clay pot go with the metal cauldron?
When they knock together, the pot will be smashed: Sirach 13:2
Let us remember that God provides for us and supplies all our needs, not our wants. We are given the freedom to choose let us choose good.
If you choose, you can keep the commandments, and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice. He has placed before you fire and water; stretch out your hand for whichever you choose. Before each person are life and death, and whichever one chooses will be given. Sirach 15:15-17
I pray that each one of us will be able to choose life, the good Christian life of moderation of earthly goods. We should store up riches in heaven and leave our children with a rich inheritance of good values and a Christian life.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Eleazar's Sacrifice

[![Eleazar's Sacrifice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/October/jpgs/Day287.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SmO0KJZi4R8 "Eleazar's Sacrifice")

### 287 Loved one‚Äôs not choosing Christ.

The number one concern parents have is their children are not prayerful and are not living a holy life. It can be frustrating to see your kids go astray and make wrong choices in life. Sometimes parents feel as though it would have been better if this prodigal child had never been born in the first place.

Do not yearn for worthless children,
or rejoice in wicked offspring.
Even if they be many, do not rejoice in them
if they do not have fear of the LORD.
Do not count on long life for them,
or have any hope for their future.
For one can be better than a thousand;
rather die childless than have impious children! Sirach 16: 1-3

We see the strong language used here in the Proverbs and may feel that the father in the proverb is too harsh. But I think it can be justified that the father truly wants the good of the child, he wants the child to do good and to have a good future. This is not just applicable for children but can be extended to any relationship, sometimes the children are in the Lord and the parents are away, many a times its one spouse in the Lord and the other one in the world.
Life can get very frustrating when we don‚Äôt see a child, spouse, parent, sibling or friend turning away from the Lord. It can be very painful to see a loved one trapped in addictions and lured into the traps of the world. We may reach a point of depression when we look at them ruin their lives, but we are called to have hope, hope against hope trusting God with every situation and every person. We have to take on the heart of the Father of the prodigal son who waits everyday for his son‚Äôs return. We are to pray and be open to God‚Äôs grace, hoping that the loved one will turn back to the Lord. Let us remember that God waits with us for them, we are not on our own but are partnering with God when we give someone a second chance. Let us ask great saints like St Monica to pray for us to be able to wait for others to change, remember waiting is loving.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
