### Cattle, Boils, and Hail ###

### Day 32: “Habitual sins” - Michael Eltham ###

We see Pharoah doing it again. He asks for the plague to be taken away and promises to send God’s people to worship – but when the plague is taken away – he goes back to hardening his heart again.

Isn’t that the case with us and our habitual sins?

The first time is always the hardest time to commit a sin. We need to really fight against our conscience (hopefully a well-formed conscience) and do the bad deed. After committing the sin – and the momentary pleasure has passed – one feels very sorry for their sin, they possibly make a confession and decide to never commit that sin again.

More often than not, one slips into the same sin again, goes through the process of repentance again.

This sin continues over and over again and becomes what we call a “Habitual sin”.

The person is in bondage to the sin unless the person truly has “metanoia”(a change of mind/heart) and allows the Holy Spirit to strengthen them through the sacramental life.

Let us join the Psalmist in this prayer for habitual sin.

Ps 19: 13 “Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent of the great transgression.”

Also, don’t be discouraged even St Paul prayed three times for the thorn in his flesh to be taken away and was given the answer that 

“My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” 2 Cor 12:19

May all our bondages to habitual sin be broken in Jesus' name.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 32 - Gabriella ###

We are so blessed by our heavenly Father to know how merciful and loving He is to each and every soul. I have now gained a clear perspective on Pharaoh’s behaviour and heart. 

I have also often pondered why does God harden Pharaoh’s heart? He did not take away his free will. In fact God revealed himself to Pharaoh who knew God was above all gods and in spite of this Pharaoh obstinately refuses to acknowledge God. And God shows His goodness, His power but it was Pharaoah who hardened his heart. 

*Hebrews 3:7–8*
Therefore the Holy Spirit says, 'Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in rebellion. . . “

### Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born ###

### Day 33: “Idols and false gods” ###

We see the 10 plagues and would wonder why 10; Fr Mike explains it so beautifully about the 10 gods that the Egyptians had and Pharoah would not be content until he saw all those gods defeated. Our God, “God Almighty”, “the great I AM - Yahweh”, “the First and the Last”, “the source of all good” destroyed every false Egyptian god with each plague.

God wanted to free His people so that they can go and worship Him.

We have many false gods and idols in our lives. The dictionary meaning for god is “(in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity. “

Let us examine our hearts to see what is it that has power over us? What is it that controls us?

Could be our sins, incorrect beliefs, things, status, power, or people. Or it could be us creating God in our own image instead of learning who He is and how he wants to be worshiped.

Moses tells Pharaoh that they need to also take the cattle along with them to worship the Lord because Moses does not know how God would want them to offer sacrifice.

Moses was not being sneaky but being honest here.

We need to be honest as we journey through the BIAY and see what unfolds, how does God want us to worship? What does Jesus command us to do? “Do this in memory of me”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
