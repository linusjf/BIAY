### Cattle, Boils, and Hail ###

[![Cattle, Boils, and Hail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day032.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SvEX0iOA8xU "Cattle, Boils, and Hail")

### Day 32: “Habitual sins” - Michael Eltham ###

We see Pharoah doing it again. He asks for the plague to be taken away and promises to send God’s people to worship – but when the plague is taken away – he goes back to hardening his heart again.

Isn’t that the case with us and our habitual sins?

The first time is always the hardest time to commit a sin. We need to really fight against our conscience (hopefully a well-formed conscience) and do the bad deed. After committing the sin – and the momentary pleasure has passed – one feels very sorry for their sin, they possibly make a confession and decide to never commit that sin again.

More often than not, one slips into the same sin again, goes through the process of repentance again.

This sin continues over and over again and becomes what we call a “Habitual sin”.

The person is in bondage to the sin unless the person truly has “metanoia”(a change of mind/heart) and allows the Holy Spirit to strengthen them through the sacramental life.

Let us join the Psalmist in this prayer for habitual sin.

Ps 19: 13 “Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent of the great transgression.”

Also, don’t be discouraged even St Paul prayed three times for the thorn in his flesh to be taken away and was given the answer that 

“My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” 2 Cor 12:19

May all our bondages to habitual sin be broken in Jesus' name.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 32 - Gabriella ###

We are so blessed by our heavenly Father to know how merciful and loving He is to each and every soul. I have now gained a clear perspective on Pharaoh’s behaviour and heart. 

I have also often pondered why does God harden Pharaoh’s heart? He did not take away his free will. In fact God revealed himself to Pharaoh who knew God was above all gods and in spite of this Pharaoh obstinately refuses to acknowledge God. And God shows His goodness, His power but it was Pharaoah who hardened his heart. 

*Hebrews 3:7–8*
Therefore the Holy Spirit says, 'Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in rebellion. . . “

### Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born ###

[![Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day033.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YqYQ4HePEOE "Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born")

### Day 33: “Idols and false gods” ###

We see the 10 plagues and would wonder why 10; Fr Mike explains it so beautifully about the 10 gods that the Egyptians had and Pharoah would not be content until he saw all those gods defeated. Our God, “God Almighty”, “the great I AM - Yahweh”, “the First and the Last”, “the source of all good” destroyed every false Egyptian god with each plague.

God wanted to free His people so that they can go and worship Him.

We have many false gods and idols in our lives. The dictionary meaning for god is “(in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity. “

Let us examine our hearts to see what is it that has power over us? What is it that controls us?

Could be our sins, incorrect beliefs, things, status, power, or people. Or it could be us creating God in our own image instead of learning who He is and how he wants to be worshiped.

Moses tells Pharaoh that they need to also take the cattle along with them to worship the Lord because Moses does not know how God would want them to offer sacrifice.

Moses was not being sneaky but being honest here.

We need to be honest as we journey through the BIAY and see what unfolds, how does God want us to worship? What does Jesus command us to do? “Do this in memory of me”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Passover Instituted ###

[![The Passover Instituted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day034.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7sPdLnUkhRE "The Passover Instituted")

### Day 34: “Who is worthy” - Michael Eltham ###

We all are familiar with what went down in the Passover. The explanation today in the podcast is remarkable, so many items to talk about. However, will stick to one. The uncircumcised shall not eat of the lamb.

As described by Justin Martyr in the ~150 AD that the Eucharist was only received by some, even today only the baptized are allowed to receive communion.

Modern beliefs (15th century) of “Saved by Faith alone” run into hot water when we go deeper in scripture and learn the true meaning, not just what it means in the 21st century, but by understating the traditions and history of the Israelites. Below are some points on why Baptism is considered so important to be saved, to be integrated into the church, and to prepare us to receive the Eucharist.

Unlike the common definition for born again – “Believe in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved”

Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.” John 3:5

Water & Spirit

We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.

2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again – we have the theme of water and Spirit.

3. We see the Israelites crossing the red see(water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.

Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.

4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land

5. Jesus was baptized – in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.

6. So you are being saved by BAPTISIM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)

7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)

8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession

9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Crossing the Red Sea ###

[![Crossing the Red Sea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day035.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ckv9Lc74htE "Crossing the Red Sea")

### Day 35: “The Lord is fighting for us” - Michael Eltham ###

We see how the Israelites get impatient and start complaining, that they were better off in Egypt.

But God tells us not to give us, not to succumb to the small trials we face. We need to “be still”, for the Lord is fighting for us. Does that mean we need to do nothing? Or maybe it means we need to stand our ground, keep doing good, resist the enemy and persevere.

Let us not trust in our own ability or strength. We need to just keep moving forward in the direction the Lord is leading us, even though it seems hard and there is no possible solution.

The Lord will make a way where there seems to be no way, He will open up the sea to lead us a dry path. Just keep doing what He commands you to do, our perseverance will be rewarded with a "breakthrough".

The Lord will crush the enemy that pursues us, that comes after us. The Lord will wipe them out from the face of the earth, like Pharoah and his chariots – there will be none left.

“If God is for us, who can be against us?” Rom 8:31

“Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.” Ps 20:7

Jer 20:11 “”

But the Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. “

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 35 Anonymous ### 

Joseph's bones were carried out of Egypt as told by him.  This is an eye-opener to me, as I wondered why remains are preserved even today.
GOD has revealed Himself in humility,  poverty, allowed us to torture Hiim.
The Lord fights for you, you have to only keep still.

### Manna From Heaven ###

[![Manna From Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day036.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1WTXCYU6f7U "Manna From Heaven")

### Day 36: “Murmuring for Manna to Murmuring about the True presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.” - Michael Eltham ###

A few weeks after the great Miracle of the Red Sea parting, the Israelites start their murmuring.

They look back at the days of their slavery and say it would have been better for us to have died in the land of Egypt, at least we had enough to eat. God rains Manna from heaven, the bread that came down from heaven. This bread that they ate sustained them for the journey to the promised land.

This was just a prefiguration of what we have today in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the bread of life, the bread that came down from Heaven. Jesus was born in Bethlehem - which means “House of Bread”.

Jesus offers us His body in the Eucharist, our daily Manna. The food that will sustain us on our journey to the promised land – Heaven.

Jesus referred to this incident in John 6

“I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”

Most people started “murmuring” after this teaching – about eating his flesh. They said this teaching was too difficult and they stopped following Jesus. If the bread he offered was just symbolic and not real flesh, they would have not left, Jesus meant His flesh. We will deep dive into this when we get to John.

Are we murmuring about the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist? The Eucharist is truly Jesus’ Body and Blood, the food that will sustain us on our journey to Heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 36 Simitra ###

Exodus 16:17-18, "And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat".

Irrespective of the quantity they collected, those who collected  much did not have left over and those who collected less were not in lack.

This is so profound. If only we can look at this and know that no matter how much we accumulate it will never be sufficient for our greed however those who are in poverty are  living their lives relying on God to give them their fill each day and so are filled.

So let us live to worship God. We are given six days to work and keep one day -the Sabbath Holy as it is the day that we are to praise and worship God for his goodness. One day to praise and thank God, so that we remember that we have His grace with us on the six days that we work.

### Day 36 Anonymous ###

God is training them. Trying to teach His people who He is and the degree to which they can trust Him.  He is faithful.   We have to be obedient to Him, His commandments.   He told the people of Israel not to keep food He gave them for the next day.  Yet some disobeyed and kept, but next day it was spoilt.  God shows how truthful He is.  But when God commanded them to gather on the sixth day for 2 days as it was Sabbath, Holy to The Lord, the food never spoilt.  Such is the Power of God Almighty.  What He says He does.
All Glory to HIM!

### The Mystical Works of God ###

[![The Mystical Works of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day037.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E1KpvQIdeco "The Mystical Works of God")

### Day 37: “Water from the Rock - Jesus” - Michael Eltham ###

Before we get into the water from the rock, there is a moving image of the power of intercessory prayer. We see when Moses held up his hands the Israelites prevailed and when he put his hand down the Amaleks prevailed. When his hands grew weary Arron and Hur helped lift them up.

The life lesson to learn here is – when we encounter difficult situations and big problems(war) we need to lift up our arms in prayer (Be still for the Lord is fighting for us – we ought to keep praying and stand our ground) and when we get weary of praying we need our family, friends and community to support us in prayer.

“Israelites the fault finders” sounds a little harsh when we call them out like this, but aren’t we being fault finders when we call out their fault. Let’s put ourselves in their shoes and we would possibly do the same if we were without water. We would probably say “Isn’t God with us?”

The Lord command Moses to strike the rock with his rod and water flowed out. This quenched their thirst.

Jesus the new Moses is the rock Himself, the rock of ages, the stone that the builders rejected.

When the soldiers pierced His side, blood and water poured out. The living water – the Holy Spirit – the water that Jesus spoke about at the well to the Samaritan women.

“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” Jh 4:13

Jesus fulfils this promise on Pentecost, He send the Holy Spirit the Living waters to become within us a spring of water gushing  up to eternal life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Ten Commandments ###

[![The Ten Commandments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day038.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vAZYQXQl-zI "The Ten Commandments")

### Day 38 “Relationship and Rules” - Michael Eltham ###

No relationship will flourish without rules. There is no sport without rules, no school without school rules, imagine driving on a road without any traffic rules, would you put your money in a bank with no rules and anyone could withdraw your money. Rules are for the common good of all.

When you buy any product, it will always come with a manual to use the product. No one will put stainless steel containers in a microwave or fill water in a car gas tank. Without knowing we are following rules in the world, what if you decide to not believe in the law of gravity and decide to walk off a skyscraper. Foolishness. :)

God gave us commandments not to burden us or to make us miserable. But to give us a guideline to live the good life. Just imagine if everyone followed the commandments, if everyone had a right relationship with God, honored their parents, did not steal, kill, or commit adultery. It would have been heaven on earth. Being human we tend to dabble with sin, we look for momentary satisfaction and a shortcut (For example: eating the forbidden fruit to become like God)

Sin causes shame, like Adam and Eve we want to hide from God. We lose our right relationship with God which leaves us empty. We try to fill this emptiness with more temporary satisfaction by committing more sin. We will never rest until we rest in God.

Let us rise up and go to the Father who is waiting for us. Try again to follow His commandments so that it will be good with us and we are in the right state with God, we will walk with Him fearlessly in the Garden in the cool of the evening.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Slavery in the Old Testament ###

[![Slavery in the Old Testament](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day039.jpg)](https://youtu.be/otX2IGrq7wI "Slavery in the Old Testament")

### Day 39 “God delivered Israelites from slavery, now He will slowly remove slavery from their hearts”  - Michael Eltham ###

Like Fr Mike explained so beautifully, God must deal gently with us broken human beings. If we take the reading out of context, we can tend to say that God likes slavery and hence made rules for the slaves. If God does not stoop down to our level, we will not be able to bare God, just like when God spoke to his people on mount Sanai a few chapters ago it was like thunder and the people requested Moses that God not speak to them, rather Moses be the listener. 

A nocturnal creature like a rodent – would flee to hide when there is a bright light turned ON. In the same way, if God reveals Himself to us directly, we will die of awe. We will be blinded like Saul(St Paul) we will be consumed by His fire of Love. God is dealing gently with the Israelites who were slaves for generations (400 years), slavery is a way of life for them. It’s just like bringing an abused pet home, we need to first let the pet know that we are not going to hurt it. We need to give it space, and offer it some calm, some care, although we want to go and hug it and tell it that we mean no harm, the pet is not in a state to understand care and love – it will bite us if we approach it with too much of enthusiasm. It took God little time to get the Israelites out of slavery (Egypt) but will take many years to get slavery (Egypt) out of their hearts. Let us journey with them, as the Lord journeys with us to lead us slowly and gently to wholeness as He leads the Israelites to the promised land both physically and mentally. 

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Laws of Justice ###

[![Laws of Justice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day040.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zDgMhpvzoFU "Laws of Justice")

### Day 40: “Only Mortal sin makes us unworthy of receiving communion, not just bodily discharge” - Michael Eltham ###

We are invited to the great banquet, the lamb’s supper – we receive Jesus’ body and blood. To respond to this invitation, we must prepare ourselves for so great and so holy a moment. 

St. Paul urges us to examine our conscience: "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself."218 Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion. CC 1385

The reason I bring it up is for us not to get too worried about instructions in Leviticus about becoming unclean from bodily discharge. Remember these instructions are Baby steps that will evolve into solid teaching by the time Jesus comes.

The only thing that makes us unworthy of receiving communion is Mortal sin. If the bodily discharge is due to a mortal sin then you are unworthy due to the mortal sin, not the bodily discharge alone.

“But what comes out of the man, that is what defiles him.
 From within the man, from his heart,
 come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,
 adultery, greed, malice, deceit,
 licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.
 All these evils come from within and they defile.”Mk 7:21-23

Jesus is making it very clear that we should not pay too much attention to outward things but focus on the heart, for from the heart comes sin and it is sin that defiles us.

Congratulations on making it to day 40, the number 40 means a long time in the bible. Kudos to us.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### The Day of Atonement ###

[![The Day of Atonement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day041.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7HQsLHrXcw4 "The Day of Atonement")

### Day 41: “Atonement for sins – Confession & Eucharist” ###

Instructions given for atonement of sins are so detailed and clear, two lambs were needed – one for the priests and one for the people, placing the sins on the lamb and sacrificing one and sending the other one out to the wilderness to die.

Jesus is the spotless lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. He does not need two lambs as He was the priest himself, a priest in the order of Melchizedek, He had no sins and only had to carry the sins of the people.

“ Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for those of the people; this he did once for all when he offered himself. “ Heb 7:27

We need not offer lambs, goats, or bulls anymore as Jesus paid for our sins once and for all. However, we are invited to celebrate the Lamb's supper everyday “Do this in memory of me”.

We are invited to the “Atonement of sins” and the sacrifice literally every day at Mass and mandatory once a week on Sunday.

We need to prepare for Mass by checking our hearts for any unconfessed sins.

We need to pray with the Psalmist and examine our conscience

Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts. See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

Ps 139:23-24

If our sins are Venial then a Confession is not Mandatory as the truly repented "Venial" sins are forgiven at Mass, but if it’s a Mortal sin we need to make a confession to be made worthy to receive communion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

As we hear the laws and detailed instructions, we can’t help but realize how privileged we are, we don’t live in barbarous times. We live in Nations that have laws and regulations. We also have something called the natural and moral law. We have manners and acceptable social behavior. Let’s thank the Lord for He is the source of all good. 

James 1:17 “ Everything good comes from God”.

CCC 1961 God, our Creator and Redeemer, chose Israel for himself to be his people and revealed his Law to them, thus preparing for the coming of Christ. The Law of Moses expresses many truths naturally accessible to reason. These are stated and authenticated within the covenant of salvation.

Many of these laws are still relevant today and that’s why marriage is not permitted for those closely related, the human race has come a long way.

However, we notice that the sexual immorality that was happening back then is still happening in our sociality today. Instead of correcting the bad behavior, society praises them and the government law permits it.

We need to heed the warning of the Lord lest our nations will be destroyed.

Lev 18: 22-24

“Men, you must not have sexual relations with another man as with a woman. That is a terrible sin!

“Men, you must not have sexual relations with any animal. This will make you filthy. And women, you must not have sexual relations with any animal. It is against nature!

“Don’t make yourself unclean by doing any of these wrong things! I am throwing nations off their land and giving it to you because they did those terrible sins.

They made the land filthy. Now the land is sick of those things, and it will vomit out the people who live there.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 42 - Jenita ###

In these reading we see how God constantly watches and cares for his children. 

He sees to their every need and ensures they are fit to be in his presence. 

The people show acts of trust, and thats what we need to learn today. 


Trust in God and obey his laws

### Day 42 Anonymous ###

Despite His wonders they did  not believe. 
Their  heart was not steadfast towards Him.
The temptations to 
Forget what U hv done.
How good You are, and how fickle  we can be.
3 -laws-  a particular kind of Society,  temple worship and sexual morality - this is an universal, absolute commandment.

### Day 43: “The Tabernacle, His presence” - Michael Eltham. ###

We could get lost in the details as we read today's reading about the “blueprint” of the Tabernacle. Whenever I see a lot of detail documented the stance I take is that the thing is of great importance. The more the details the greater the importance. “If we have no plan we are planning to fail” A few things that struck home when I was hearing the readings was the close similarity of the worship in the Catholic Church thousands of years later. The concept of the bread of the presence – where bread is always present with a lampstand near it, every catholic church has one and this makes the church holy.

The Old Testament bread was just bread offered up to the Lord, but our NT bread is the consecrated body of Jesus, the true flesh of Jesus. (John 6) This is not just biblical but also proven by countless Eucharistic Miracles that have taken place down the centuries. Many of the Miracles have been scientifically evaluated and found to be supernatural – Like when the bleeding host was evaluated – it turned out to be the heart tissue of a middle-aged man in distress. So many other similarities like the Holy of Holies – the general area and the altar of the church. The table of offering the cherubim and the mercy seat etc. One thing to call out is Catholics do not worship any of the images or statues – they are just visuals for us to worship God, we do worship Jesus who is present in the Tabernacle and that’s why we bow down.

And let us not forget that the mercy seat was built on top of the ark of the covenant – just to remind us that God’s mercy is above the law. He loves us first and has mercy towards us, the law is something we need to follow to be better lovers of God and Neighbour. But His Mercy exceeds the law. We are saved by His Mercy and not by following the law.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### Day 43 Simitra ###

Exodus 25:30
And you shall set the bread of the Presence on the table before me always.

The bread of the presence was placed in the Holy Place for which there was no direct access to the people of Israel.

However today Jesus the bread of Life is not only placed in the Tabernacle daily but is also willingly entering into our hearts. How blessed we are as Roman Catholics to receive the presence of God through the Holy Eucharist DAILY. Thank you Jesus for nourishing us with your body, the bread of life daily.

### Priestly Garments ###

### Day 44: “Priests' clothes during Worship aren’t Jeans and T-shirt” - Michael Eltham ###

The detailed description of the vestments in today's reading can get to you. Hope this pictures, I found on the internet will help.

In our modern day and age we see fashion and style becoming increasingly immodest. This has crept into the church, we see a few Church goers, may be even some “Choir members” or lectors not wear appropriate attire. We also see that in some non-Catholic demonization, there is an over emphasis on how the Stage looks – lights -sound, rock start pastors, pastors preaching in Jeans/shorts/t-shirts or overly fancy suits. All that is okay for a Christian concert or a social event. It’s important to give our best to God, however we need to follow His instructions when it comes to true Worship. When we attend Mass, we are celebrating the grand wedding feast of the Lamb – we are His bride and He is our bridegroom. We need to be modest and dressed well to honor Him.

The Priest is persona Christi – represents Christ. The Vestments – are meant to obscure the individuality of the priest and to draw attention to Christ. He is no longer black, white or brown or young, old, weak, strong -he loses his identity – Like John the Baptist said “He must increase and I Must decrease”

The priest like in the OT had 12 stones on his breastplate to represent the 12 tribes of Israel. He carried God’s people in His heart when we offered the sacrifice. Even our priest carry the people in their heart when they offer the sacrifice of the Mass. Each part of the Bishop's vestment means something worth learning about.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.

### Day 45: “Holy Priests and celibacy” ###

When major clergy scandals come up, we can very easily blame the priests and the bishops. However, we need to remember that priests come from families and from the community. There is a lot of sin and corruption in this world that has influenced everyone laity and priests alike. We need to pray and support our brother priests to lead a holy life. And we need to also bring to justice those who have violated the innocence of others.

The catholic priests are called to imitate Jesus at a higher level, hence are also called to celibacy.

Below is an excerpt from “Catholic Answers ”

In examining the issue of celibacy, we should first address its historical development in the life of the Church and then its spiritual basis and relevance for today’s clergy.

Our Lord presented celibacy as a legitimate lifestyle not only by His very life since He never married but also in His teaching. When our Lord emphasized that marriage was a covenant between husband and wife and thereby prohibited divorce and re-marriage (cf. Matthew 19:3-12), He concluded, “Some men are incapable of sexual activity from birth; some have been deliberately made so; and some there are who have freely renounced sex for the sake of God’s reign.” Traditionally, our Church– as evidenced in the Catechism (#1579)– points to this “free renunciation of sex for the sake of God’s reign” as a basis for celibacy.

Nevertheless, in the early Church, clerical celibacy was not mandated. St. Paul in his first letter to St. Timothy wrote, “A bishop must be irreproachable, married only once, of even temper, self-controlled, modest, and hospitable” (3:2) and “Deacons may be married but once and must be good managers of their children and their households” (3:12). However, one should not erroneously construe this teaching to mean that a bishop, priest, or deacon had to be married; St. Paul admitted that he himself was not married (I Corinthians 7:8).

Let us pray for our priest today.

### Set Apart for God ###

[![Set Apart for God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day046.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UYClL-9IDGo "Set Apart for God")

### Day 46: “Holy Oil, Holy water, Holy stuff, Sacramentals” ###

It’s fascinating to see how many of the practices in the catholic church stem from OT instructions from the Lord. The sabbath law, the consecrating of cups, temples, altars, and priests.

We see that priests were anointed with oil. One thing to call out is there is no intrinsic power in the oil or the oil on its own has no power - it’s the method God prescribes.

Just as we dedicate different bowls for different purposes, the bowls used to feed the dogs won’t be used to feed the kids.

When something is blessed – all we do is mark it for special use, for a supernatural purpose.

That’s why the priests are anointed and set apart to do God’s work.

Even oils, water, salt, medals, prayer cloths, bibles, pictures, and statues are used, once blessed are called “sacramentals” They are used for sacramental purposes and for personal prayer use.

The blessed items are holy and will help remind us to pray and even ward off evil. It can be used when praying prayers of healing or deliverance. Many miracles have taken place with the use of sacramentals.

One of the Biblical references for sacramentals can be seen in acts, where handkerchiefs from Paul healed sick people.

Acts 29: 11, 12 “God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits came out of them.”

Go on Sprinkle some Holy water 😃

Joke: How do you make holy water? 

Boil the hell out of it. 😂

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Golden Calf ###

[![The Golden Calf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day047.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rCAaZjEWy34 "The Golden Calf")

### Day 47: “Man-O-Man what a man - Moses” “We the stiff-necked people want to make God in our own image” “Be a Levite – on the Lord’s Side” ###

There is a lot going on in this one Chapter on the Golden calf. Moses goes up for a time of awesome experience with God, receives tablets that were written by God’s own finger.

The people waiting for Moses go impatient and uncertain, remember God performed great Miracles for these people – brought them out of Egypt by making a dry path in the red sea, manna from heaven, water from the rock, quails from the sky, etc. Yet they get impatient they go to Aaron for a solution.

Aaron does the unthinkable – he takes all the gold and makes a calf. Are we not like Aaron and the Israelites, we go impatient and want to take things into our own hands. Isn’t this Pandemic making us a little impatient and we just want to take things into our own hands.

In general, we tend to take what is good and make it the “ultimate”. We take the good things of this world like science, riches, medicine, technology, learning, job, spouses, children, earthly leaders and make little gods out of them, rather than using the things of this world we start misusing them, and then we eventually become salves of these false gods of power, fame, status, fitness, looks, beauty, health. We are a stiff-necked people who want to even take control of God, we want to make of HIM an idol, put him on the shelf when we don’t want Him, bring Him out when we need Him.

On one side we see the evil stiff-necked people and on the other side, we see this Holy Man Moses.

He puts himself on the line - Interceding for the people he prays “Lord blot out my name – but please forgive them”. Just how Abraham pleaded for Sodom and Gomorrah and Moses for the idolaters – You and Me are called to be Intercessorsfor this broken and sinful world.

We are called to be Levites, the tribe that ordained themselves by standing up for the Lord. When Moses cried out “Who is on the Lord's side” the Levites took up sword and slay 3000 Men.

We need to be defenders of the faith in this world, we need to take a stand against all evil. Please don’t take up swords and start slaying people, but take up the Word of God, the double edge sword, learn it, and use it to slay the evil forces, evil thoughts, and evil theory in this world.

We need to proclaim the Word of God and give every soul an opportunity to be saved.

May the Holy Spirit Lead us.🙏

### God's Presence ###

[![God's Presence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day048.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-LqhdCd_rjo "God's Presence")

### Day 48: “Personal relationship with God” “Eucharistic Adoration - Our tent of the presence” ###

We see this beautiful relationship that Moses had with God. He goes up into the Tent of the Presence regularly and spends time with God. When he came out his face was transformed glowing and radiant. Although he did not see God’s face (no one can live after seeing God's face) when Moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the Lord would speak with Moses. Even though Moses wanted to see God in all His glory the Lord spared Moses and told him that no one could live if they saw God in all His glory. He did see God's back.

Let us not feel jealous of Moses, we have our own tent of meeting in the Eucharistic Lord. When we go to Eucharistic Adoration, we see God’s face in the host. It is truly God’s face because He said “This is my body”. The only reason we don’t see Jesus in all His splendor and glory is for our sake. If we see God’s glory fully revealed we will not be able to live. Although the effect is the same, if you look at people who frequent Eucharistic adoration, their faces will be glowing. Look at pictures of many saints their faces seem aglow, and they have a hallow as well. All saints love adoration, Mother Theresa would frequent adoration before and after her busy day – this gave her the strength needed to serve the poor and the ability to see Jesus in each person she met.

To be able to live this life of vows, these four vows, we need our life to be woven with the Eucharist. That’s why we begin our day with Jesus in the Holy Eucharist. With him, we go forward. And when we come back in the evening we have one hour of adoration before Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and at this you will be surprised, that we have not had to cut down our work for the poor.

-Saint Mother Theresa.

Here in the adoration, we can like Moses ask for anything and it will be given to us.

If it’s not for God's presence, we cannot move forward. Like Moses we need to tell the Lord unless you come with us we will not go anywhere. I'm sure the Lord will grant us this request.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### The Year of Jubilee ###

[![The Year of Jubilee](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day049.jpg)](https://youtu.be/rG1InQh9tjg "The Year of Jubilee")

### Day 49: “A willing and cheerful giver” ###

As we read the blueprint that God gives the Israelites, the details are so many. If I was given these instructions, I would say let’s just make a square box for the tablets and get done with it. I would think why all this fuss about the hooks, the poles, the mercy seat, the curtains, the jewelry, the altars, the utensils, the lamps.
But the Israelites responded with great willingness, they came everyone whose heart stirred him, everyone whose spirit moved him, men and women, with different skills weaving, constructing, etc. The people started looking for stuff in their houses, they brought jewelry, fine cloth, anything of value, they brought stuff every day.
“The people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the Lord has commanded us to do. So the people were restrained from bringing; for the stuff they had was sufficient to all the work and more” Ex 35:5,7
There is something for us to learn from the Israelites, we need to cultivate this attitude towards God’s work. We should go out of our way to give towards the Gospel, give of our time, our talent, and our resources. We should be willing and our hearts should be stirring to do God’s work and to love our neighbor.
“God loves a cheerful giver.” 2 Cor 9:7
May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Day 49 Anonymous ### 

There's no greater act that any human can do than the Act of Worship!
Open our hearts to trust in You, to love You, Lord.  
Jubilee Year - The year of restoration.  In this year every Israelite slave would be restored to freedom, 
because they are not meant to be slaves.  "I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF EGYPT."
Thank You Lord, for Your mercies n not letting us be slaves forever!

### Sacrificial Offerings ###

[![Sacrificial Offerings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day050.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RsiztOG3g-E "Sacrificial Offerings")

### Day 50 “Obedience” - Michael Eltham ###
In Leviticus 26 we see detailed explanations on what happens to those who are obedient and those who disobey.
The promise of the Lord for the obedient are many, the most important is “I will walk with you, I will be your God”. I think this is important as we recall the story of creation, where God walked with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening. It’s reminding me of that story where a prince of a kingdom wanted to give gifts to a few dedicated people, others picked land and gold but one maiden picked the prince himself. She said, “If I have the prince, I have everything else”. That is the best choice that we need to make as well.
We also see the detail of wrath, looks like those who disobey the Lord, get more and more punishment. Like a good Father, God does not want to punish us but cause us to choose him over things of the world, we need to be obedient to be restored to what our first parents lost. If we are obedient the promise is great, “I will walk with you, I am you, God”. We will walk with the Lord in the cool of the evening. We will experience His presence in our daily lives.
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. 🙏

### Israel's Worship of God ###

[![Israel's Worship of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day051.jpg)](https://youtu.be/waXS43o9qa0 "Israel's Worship of God")

### Day 51 “Getting worship of God right” "Votive offerings" ###
Some would argue that God is Omnipresent, and we can worship Him anywhere, there is no need for a structure. Yes, we can worship God anywhere, there is no harm in that. But if we have been paying close attention, we see detailed instructions about the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, the altars, the screens, the lampstand, and most important the consecration of the place to be dedicated for the worship of the most High God.
Of course, the Lord is present when you read your bible at home, He is present when you sing praise songs while driving, He is present in your family prayer and person prayer. However, He calls us to go to Church, the place dedicated to His worship, community worship. We see in the reading how the cloud of smoke engulfed the tabernacle, the presence of the Lord was so strong that the Levites could not even go in. We need to be sensitive to the presence of God when we go to church, bow down and adore Him in the tabernacle. And as we will read later – how Jesus will teach us "how to worship", and we will read how the apostles were dedicated to the breaking of bread and if we like we can go deeper and learn how the early Christians and the church fathers worshiped God (not part of the Bible, but can be found in early historic records and writings) it’s amazing how the Eucharist is the fulfillment of the earlier sacrifices and the one method of worship that was instituted by Jesus and practice and preserved through the generations in its original state. We will learn more as we read through the BIAY. But for now, let us remember that we need to Get worship right, not how we want to, but how God prescribes it.
Votive Offering – Many people were so moved by the Lord that they wanted to give more than what is asked. That’s why we see the value of work(wages) of different people men, women of diff ages had a different Shekel value. It was for those who could not offer sacrifice because there were not Levites, yet wanted to offer more than what was asked of them. Hence they gave their value of wages in the votive offering. 
We need to ask ourselves – what is my votive offering. Am I just doing the minimum required or am I moved by the Lord to do more than I am asked?
How about going beyond the Sunday obligation and going to church on a few weekdays.
If we have an attitude of “If I wake up I’ll go” we need to change it and be more precise like the Levites, measure out what we can do and what we want to do for the Lord, dedicated it to the Lord and He will make sure all hurdles are removed for us to do what we intend to do.
Congratulations on completing Exodus and Leviticus!!!
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 52 “Names, names, names – God was serious when he said I have called you by name” - Michael Eltham ###
As we hear the names and the numbers we tend to tune out, it’s totally normal for us. Our capacity as human beings is limited, we can only care for ourselves, our family, and our friends.
However the Lord cares for everyone, he loves each one of us so intimately that
“He knows when we sit down and when we raise up, when we go out and when we come in. Even before a word is on our lips He already knows it.” Ps 139.
“Even your very hair is numbered: – Mat 10
He chose us
“You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you” John 15
“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” Jer 1:5
This knowledge is too much for us to understand, that our creator can love each one in such a personal way. We cannot even imagine how the Lord can love billions and billions and zillions of people across centuries. That he can care about every little thing about each person that ever existed. Even the most complex network of computer servers cannot come close to the knowledge of God. We are truly blessed to be God's chosen children. 
My favorite part of today’s psalm - 84:
Better is one day in your courts
  than a thousand elsewhere;
 I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God
  than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
I have never come out of prayer sad or hopeless. Every time we pray – we encounter God and no one leaves the presence of God sad and hopeless.
“Prayer is the best weapon we possess. It is the key that opens the heart of God.”
St Padre Pio.

### Day 53 “Following the guidance of the Lord” - Michael  Eltham ###

We see how the Lord gives them detailed instruction on how to deal with the different cities/tribes that they come across. He said that he should not fight some people (Esau’s descendants) but buy food and water from them, and then fight with those who do not let them pass. God has a plan for them, he knows the future and will guide them according to His path.

In the same way, the Lord has plans for us.

Jer 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”

We need to lean on the Lord in prayer to hear His heart and to learn what He wants of us.

“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.” Prov 3:5-6

We can find God’s heart as we read His word. His word will guide us on the right path.

“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” Ps 119:105

And always remember just as the tribe of Judah always marched first. Our praise should also go up first. Judah means praise.

May this Psalm be our song, may praise always be on our lips.

Ps 34: “I will bless the Lord at all times;
  his praise shall continually be in my mouth.”
