### Cattle, Boils, and Hail ###

[![Cattle, Boils, and Hail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day032.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SvEX0iOA8xU "Cattle, Boils, and Hail")

### Day 32: “Habitual sins” - Michael Eltham ###

We see Pharoah doing it again. He asks for the plague to be taken away and promises to send God’s people to worship – but when the plague is taken away – he goes back to hardening his heart again.

Isn’t that the case with us and our habitual sins?

The first time is always the hardest time to commit a sin. We need to really fight against our conscience (hopefully a well-formed conscience) and do the bad deed. After committing the sin – and the momentary pleasure has passed – one feels very sorry for their sin, they possibly make a confession and decide to never commit that sin again.

More often than not, one slips into the same sin again, goes through the process of repentance again.

This sin continues over and over again and becomes what we call a “Habitual sin”.

The person is in bondage to the sin unless the person truly has “metanoia”(a change of mind/heart) and allows the Holy Spirit to strengthen them through the sacramental life.

Let us join the Psalmist in this prayer for habitual sin.

Ps 19: 13 “Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me. Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent of the great transgression.”

Also, don’t be discouraged even St Paul prayed three times for the thorn in his flesh to be taken away and was given the answer that 

“My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” 2 Cor 12:19

May all our bondages to habitual sin be broken in Jesus' name.

May the Holy Spirit lead us.🙏

### Day 32 - Gabriella ###

We are so blessed by our heavenly Father to know how merciful and loving He is to each and every soul. I have now gained a clear perspective on Pharaoh’s behaviour and heart. 

I have also often pondered why does God harden Pharaoh’s heart? He did not take away his free will. In fact God revealed himself to Pharaoh who knew God was above all gods and in spite of this Pharaoh obstinately refuses to acknowledge God. And God shows His goodness, His power but it was Pharaoah who hardened his heart. 

*Hebrews 3:7–8*
Therefore the Holy Spirit says, 'Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in rebellion. . . “

### Locusts, Darkness, and Death of the First Born ###

### Day 33: “Idols and false gods” ###

We see the 10 plagues and would wonder why 10; Fr Mike explains it so beautifully about the 10 gods that the Egyptians had and Pharoah would not be content until he saw all those gods defeated. Our God, “God Almighty”, “the great I AM - Yahweh”, “the First and the Last”, “the source of all good” destroyed every false Egyptian god with each plague.

God wanted to free His people so that they can go and worship Him.

We have many false gods and idols in our lives. The dictionary meaning for god is “(in certain other religions) a superhuman being or spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human fortunes; a deity. “

Let us examine our hearts to see what is it that has power over us? What is it that controls us?

Could be our sins, incorrect beliefs, things, status, power, or people. Or it could be us creating God in our own image instead of learning who He is and how he wants to be worshiped.

Moses tells Pharaoh that they need to also take the cattle along with them to worship the Lord because Moses does not know how God would want them to offer sacrifice.

Moses was not being sneaky but being honest here.

We need to be honest as we journey through the BIAY and see what unfolds, how does God want us to worship? What does Jesus command us to do? “Do this in memory of me”

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### The Passover Instituted ###

### Day 34: “Who is worthy” - Michael Eltham ###

We all are familiar with what went down in the Passover. The explanation today in the podcast is remarkable, so many items to talk about. However, will stick to one. The uncircumcised shall not eat of the lamb.

As described by Justin Martyr in the ~150 AD that the Eucharist was only received by some, even today only the baptized are allowed to receive communion.

Modern beliefs (15th century) of “Saved by Faith alone” run into hot water when we go deeper in scripture and learn the true meaning, not just what it means in the 21st century, but by understating the traditions and history of the Israelites. Below are some points on why Baptism is considered so important to be saved, to be integrated into the church, and to prepare us to receive the Eucharist.

Unlike the common definition for born again – “Believe in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved”

Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.” John 3:5

Water & Spirit

We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.

2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again – we have the theme of water and Spirit.

3. We see the Israelites crossing the red see(water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.

Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.

4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land

5. Jesus was baptized – in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.

6. So you are being saved by BAPTISIM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)

7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)

8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession

9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏

### Crossing the Red Sea ###

[![Crossing the Red Sea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day035.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ckv9Lc74htE "Crossing the Red Sea")

### Day 35: “The Lord is fighting for us” - Michael Eltham ###

We see how the Israelites get impatient and start complaining, that they were better off in Egypt.

But God tells us not to give us, not to succumb to the small trials we face. We need to “be still”, for the Lord is fighting for us. Does that mean we need to do nothing? Or maybe it means we need to stand our ground, keep doing good, resist the enemy and persevere.

Let us not trust in our own ability or strength. We need to just keep moving forward in the direction the Lord is leading us, even though it seems hard and there is no possible solution.

The Lord will make a way where there seems to be no way, He will open up the sea to lead us a dry path. Just keep doing what He commands you to do, our perseverance will be rewarded with a "breakthrough".

The Lord will crush the enemy that pursues us, that comes after us. The Lord will wipe them out from the face of the earth, like Pharoah and his chariots – there will be none left.

“If God is for us, who can be against us?” Rom 8:31

“Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.” Ps 20:7

Jer 20:11 “”

But the Lord is with me as a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble, they will not overcome me. They will be greatly shamed, for they will not succeed. “

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 35 Anonymous ### 

Joseph's bones were carried out of Egypt as told by him.  This is an eye-opener to me, as I wondered why remains are preserved even today.
GOD has revealed Himself in humility,  poverty, allowed us to torture Hiim.
The Lord fights for you, you have to only keep still.

### Manna From Heaven ###

[![Manna From Heaven](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day036.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1WTXCYU6f7U "Manna From Heaven")

### Day 36: “Murmuring for Manna to Murmuring about the True presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.” - Michael Eltham ###

A few weeks after the great Miracle of the Red Sea parting, the Israelites start their murmuring.

They look back at the days of their slavery and say it would have been better for us to have died in the land of Egypt, at least we had enough to eat. God rains Manna from heaven, the bread that came down from heaven. This bread that they ate sustained them for the journey to the promised land.

This was just a prefiguration of what we have today in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the bread of life, the bread that came down from Heaven. Jesus was born in Bethlehem - which means “House of Bread”.

Jesus offers us His body in the Eucharist, our daily Manna. The food that will sustain us on our journey to the promised land – Heaven.

Jesus referred to this incident in John 6

“I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”

Most people started “murmuring” after this teaching – about eating his flesh. They said this teaching was too difficult and they stopped following Jesus. If the bread he offered was just symbolic and not real flesh, they would have not left, Jesus meant His flesh. We will deep dive into this when we get to John.

Are we murmuring about the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist? The Eucharist is truly Jesus’ Body and Blood, the food that will sustain us on our journey to Heaven.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 36 Simitra ###

Exodus 16:17-18, "And the people of Israel did so. They gathered, some more, some less. But when they measured it with an omer, whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack. Each of them gathered as much as he could eat".

Irrespective of the quantity they collected, those who collected  much did not have left over and those who collected less were not in lack.

This is so profound. If only we can look at this and know that no matter how much we accumulate it will never be sufficient for our greed however those who are in poverty are  living their lives relying on God to give them their fill each day and so are filled.

So let us live to worship God. We are given six days to work and keep one day -the Sabbath Holy as it is the day that we are to praise and worship God for his goodness. One day to praise and thank God, so that we remember that we have His grace with us on the six days that we work.

### Day 36 Anonymous ###

God is training them. Trying to teach His people who He is and the degree to which they can trust Him.  He is faithful.   We have to be obedient to Him, His commandments.   He told the people of Israel not to keep food He gave them for the next day.  Yet some disobeyed and kept, but next day it was spoilt.  God shows how truthful He is.  But when God commanded them to gather on the sixth day for 2 days as it was Sabbath, Holy to The Lord, the food never spoilt.  Such is the Power of God Almighty.  What He says He does.
All Glory to HIM!

### The Mystical Works of God ###

[![The Mystical Works of God](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/February/jpgs/Day037.jpg)](https://youtu.be/E1KpvQIdeco "The Mystical Works of God")

### Day 37: “Water from the Rock - Jesus” - Michael Eltham ###

Before we get into the water from the rock, there is a moving image of the power of intercessory prayer. We see when Moses held up his hands the Israelites prevailed and when he put his hand down the Amaleks prevailed. When his hands grew weary Arron and Hur helped lift them up.

The life lesson to learn here is – when we encounter difficult situations and big problems(war) we need to lift up our arms in prayer (Be still for the Lord is fighting for us – we ought to keep praying and stand our ground) and when we get weary of praying we need our family, friends and community to support us in prayer.

“Israelites the fault finders” sounds a little harsh when we call them out like this, but aren’t we being fault finders when we call out their fault. Let’s put ourselves in their shoes and we would possibly do the same if we were without water. We would probably say “Isn’t God with us?”

The Lord command Moses to strike the rock with his rod and water flowed out. This quenched their thirst.

Jesus the new Moses is the rock Himself, the rock of ages, the stone that the builders rejected.

When the soldiers pierced His side, blood and water poured out. The living water – the Holy Spirit – the water that Jesus spoke about at the well to the Samaritan women.

“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, 14 but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” Jh 4:13

Jesus fulfils this promise on Pentecost, He send the Holy Spirit the Living waters to become within us a spring of water gushing  up to eternal life.

May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
