### Jephthah's Vow

[![Jephthah's Vow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day092.jpg)](https://youtu.be/h8yzcn23mvg "Jephthah's Vow")

### Day 92 Jesus our Redeemer

The story of Ruth is lovely, the character that Boaz shows is impeccable. Boaz does not take advantage of Ruth, when she lies down at his feet at the Threshing floor, he even makes sure that her honor is kept ‚ÄúHe tells his servant let it not be known that she came here‚Äù He is the next in kin and there is someone before him, he offers the immediate next in kin the option to Redeem Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth ‚Äì but the offer was turned down. So, Boaz steps up and does what is needed, redeeming Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth. Boaz and Ruth marry, and they have a son named Obed. These good people become part of the lineage of Jesus. Obed is the father of Jesse, and the grandfather of David.

Even though Ruth is a Moabitess, the good example and love of her mother-in-law influenced Ruth to be of good character. The Lord blessed her and even included her in the lineage of Jesus.

We should learn from their example and be good witnesses ‚Äì genuine and true. Only a genuine love for the Lord can draw people to Christ, we will also become a path for others to find Christ, just as Ruth and Boaz become part of the lineage of Jesus.

Just like Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth, we are also in need of redemption. We have committed sin and are in bondage of sin ‚Äì we have no way to redeem ourselves with our own good deeds, and our debt to pay is very high. That is why we need Jesus, who is the first in kin ‚Äì the one who will redeem us and restore us to himself. He is our bridegroom, and we are His bride.

At the start of His ministry Jesus reads proclaims that He is the promise that Isiah spoke about.

‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free‚Äú Luke 4:18

Jesus our merciful redeemer - we ask that you help us in our weakness and we offer our lives to you, please redeem and save us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Strengths and Weaknesses

[![Strengths and Weaknesses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day093.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jTp4hsgYYwE "Strengths and Weaknesses")

### Day 93: Childless couples and IVF

We see the Miracle of another old couple being blessed with a child ‚Äì the parents of Samson. There are few examples in the bible ‚Äì where older parents are blessed with a child late in life - Abraham and Sarah, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and Boaz and Ruth ‚Äì fresh in our memory.

In our modern-day ‚Äì "instant culture", we see that parents who are childless get impatient and want to have a child at any cost. Now, what is wrong with parents wanting a child and demanding it as a right. The only thing wrong is that a child is a blessing from God. God is our creator and we are co-creators with Him, it was God who initially blessed human beings and said ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply‚Äù we need to remember that God is in control. But if God is for life and the parents want a child and the church is pro-life why would IVF which is life creating ‚Äì baby making ‚Äì not be accepted by the church.

The Church has many reasons for it ‚Äì it‚Äôs based on the moral law of God and His commandments.

The life of a child should always be within the context of the marital act, remember that God is present at all times in a marriage. However with IVF the process to collect the sperm and egg ‚Äì involves sinful methods and we all know that sin separates us from God. Along with the creation of a physical baby, each baby is given a soul ‚Äì there is absolutely no way the IVF process has a way to create a soul.

God in His goodness gives the baby a soul, just as God does in the cases of a child born due to rape or fornication. However, that does not mean that God approves of rape and fornication. Something to think about.

Also, IVF has cases where there are multiple embryos and a need for selective abortion.

IVF can be a sensitive topic and I am not an expert on the church‚Äôs teachings, just sharing my thoughts based on simple research.

‚ÄúI respect your opinion if it differs‚Äú

God should always be at the center of marriage, and we should be open to life and aware of His presence during the marital act. If you are a couple considering IVF, I would like you to prayerfully consider other options of adopting a deserving child or waiting on the Lord for a child, or dedicating your life more to God‚Äôs service.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Samson and Delilah

[![Samson and Delilah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day094.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-2XUUC1_Krk "Samson and Delilah")

### Day94 Samson is ruled by his desires ‚Äì Lust is blinding

The most famous judge - Samson was blessed with great strength ‚Äì he slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. Although he had great physical strength, he had a great weakness his lust ‚Äì we can read how Samson was time and again going after non-Israeli women and harlots.

Samson is enslaved by his lust for the Harlot Delilah. The Philistines were willing to pay a lot of money to Delilah, to entice Samson and find out where his strength lies. I cannot believe how Samson kept trusting Delilah even though she tried to have him killed 3 times. However, her nagging got to him ‚Äì Samson wanted to go back to her every day, and her words ‚Äúthat he didn‚Äôt love her‚Äù got to him and he reveals the secret about his strength in the Nazirite vow ‚Äì where he does not shave his head. She let him down again by shaving his head, they captured and gouged out his eyes, and threw him in prison. It seems like a no-brainer, one would ask, couldn‚Äôt Samson a great judge appointed by God not see the trick of Delilah. He could not he was blinded by lust, which lead him to be permanently blind -as his eyes were gorged out.

Maybe it was better for him because he called out to God and God‚Äôs spirit returned to him. He was able to kill more Philistines by pulling down the pillars.

Even Jesus warns us about the lust of the eyes, let‚Äôs hear it in Jesus' words.

27 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. Mat 5

Let us hear Jesus‚Äô words and avoid the sin of lust of the eyes, as it blinds us. Even great people in the bible like Samson, King David, and evil people like Herod were all blinded by lust. Herod was so blind that he was lusting over his own daughter‚Äôs dance. Lust caused these characters to commit murder ‚Äì king David ordered Bathsheba‚Äôs husband to be murdered and Herod ordered the head of John the Baptist. Samson lost his mission to free the people from the Philistines. Lust can cause good men and women to do really bad things like rape, murder, fornication, etc.

A method to catch Bears is to soak a knife in blood and leave it out in the snow. The bear will find it and start licking the knife, keeping on licking the knife until its own tongue is cut. The bear goes into a frenzy and ends up licking its own blood and bleeds to death. This is the state of those who are trapped in habitual lust sins, they end up feeding on their own lustful appetites and will lose their soul.

The Lord is very merciful with those caught in traps of sin, He will free our shackles and redeem us. We can approach him who sits on the mercy seat, for he was tempted in every way possible. He does not condemn but wants to save.

15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Heb 4

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Sin of Benjamin

[![The Sin of Benjamin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day095.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7gq_Sgo3dfk "The Sin of Benjamin")

### Day 95: Relativism brings Chaos

NOTE: THIS EPISODE IS PG-RATED

We see one of the lowest, most gruesome episodes of the Bible in Judges. This terrible state of lawlessness was due to the fact -

‚ÄúIn those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.‚Äù Judges 21:25

Gruesome stuff, feel overwhelmed to even summarize what happened. There was a Levite who had a concubine ‚Äì this in itself is wrong, then the concubine left the Levite and went back to her father's house. The Levite went to bring her back, however, her father prevented the Levite from leaving with his daughter(we do not know the back story -may be the Levite was ill-treating her).

They eventually left and went to the tribe of Benjamin. This is where the unthinkable happened, the evil men wanted to have relations with the Levites ‚Äì which is wrong again.

The Levite and his host acted cowardly - and pushed out the concubine. The gang of men abused her all night and she was found dead in the morning at the door. The Levite cuts up her body into pieces and sends them to all of Israel and every tribe goes up to fight against Benjamin ‚Äì which is another tribe. Now, these other tribes go into the city and kill all of the Benjaminite women. Which is also very shameful.

The whole episode is just wrong. It‚Äôs a state of Chaos!!!

The root cause of this is ‚ÄúRELATIVISM‚Äù ‚Äì every man did what is right in his own mind.

Sadly, relativism has crept into our lives today. Most people just want to do what they want. Relativism has crept into the faith circles as well. There are so many denominations that seem to interpret the bible differently and if someone is not in terms with the pastor, a new sub-division is born and a "new church" with the doctrine that they like.

Even within the catholic church ‚Äì relativism has crept in. There is a growing population that wants women priests and deacons, gay and lesbian marriages to be blessed, and many want IVF and contraception to be permitted by the catholic church. Also, some do not believe in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and some do not go to confession.

And the motto of everyone has become ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù ‚Äì meaning you live your life according to your thoughts and I will live mine. The problem here is that people are taking the place of God and setting their own standards and beliefs, this is the reason there is division in the church, families, and society.

We need to return to the one source of truth, which is Jesus Christ. We need to adhere to the magisterium of the church, whose head is Jesus Christ. No teaching of the catholic church would be against the Bible ‚Äì God‚Äôs holy word ‚Äì but we cannot lock God in a book and say the Bible is the authority ‚Äì even the bible does not claim that.

‚ÄúThe solution to relativism is authority‚Äù - Michael Eltham üòÄ

The authority of the catholic church was instituted by Jesus when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and the promise that what would be bound on earth will be bound in heaven. In the old testament, the spiritual leaders of Israel had that role where they would bind something into law and agree and disagree on matters. Today that role is given to the catholic church, we should be so glad that our faith, teaching, and doctrine have been authorized by Jesus himself and passed down from generation to generation through the hands of many saints.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Hannah's Prayer

[![Hannah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day096.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z4kvCO7PhEM "Hannah's Prayer")

### Day 96 Failing to correct our children

The famous parenting proverb from the bible is

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prov 13:24

Like many things in the Bible this proverb is hyperbole, I don‚Äôt think God wants us to beat our kids with a rod.

What it really means is we need to take responsibility for our kids ‚Äì young or old, we cannot ignore their mistakes, we cannot just tell them they are wrong, what we have to do is insist, pray and hopefully get them to repent.

We see Eli trying to correct his sons ‚Äì they were having relations with the women who worked at the entrance of the tent of the meeting, this is similar to committing adultery in front of the blessed sacrament, these sons of Eli have no respect for the Lord.

I guess Eli told them but they didn‚Äôt listen, Eli was old and maybe not persistent with his parenting skills. We as parents need to learn from this, if not the Lord‚Äôs favor will not rest on our family. We need to have rules and enforce them, it is easy to give in to our kids and let them do what they want. But that is not our calling or duty as parents. I remember what my mom always told me

‚ÄúIf you bring a soul into this world, you are responsible for it‚Äù Lois Eltham.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Samuel's Prophecy

[![Samuel's Prophecy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day097.jpg)](https://youtu.be/M7TUDSy6jVs "Samuel's Prophecy")

### Day 97 Hearing the voice of God

As we read Samuel‚Äôs story, we cannot help but dwell on his calling.

It was a time of spiritual dryness

‚Äò‚Äô In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.‚Äù 1 Sam 3:1

Samuel didn‚Äôt know who was speaking for the first 3 times, with Eli‚Äôs guidance he was able to know it was the Lord that was speaking.

The world seems to be in the same state as at that time (there were not many visions or messages from God). We meet a lot of people these days who are unable to connect with God, the noise and craziness of this world seem to be blocking out the voice of God. People are busy with so many things, especially their cell phones.

The is a new phobia/fear NOMOPHOBIA or NO MObile PHone PhoBIA is used to describe a psychological condition when people have a fear of being detached from mobile phone connectivity.

We feel the need to be connected to people - family and friends and the internet and need all the news in a flash. Sadly, we have lost the longing to hear God‚Äôs voice.

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:John 10:27

We have failed to create an environment where we can quiet our hearts and listen to the Lord, be moved by the prompting of the Holy Spirit. We need to spend quiet time in prayer and listen to what God is speaking to us.

If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.Gal 5:25

We need to have a listening heart and constantly ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in literally everything we do. There is no right or wrong way to listen to God‚Äôs voice, some experience it while reading the bible ‚Äì where some verses catch their attention, some experience it while waiting on the Lord in quiet adoration, some experience guidance by means of feeling peace in decisions, some get help from prayer patterns and counselors, some experience God‚Äôs guidance in the Gifts of the Holy Spirit like visions, gift of knowledge and wisdom. The method is always between you and God ‚Äì but the important thing is to make time and the right environment for God to speak to us.

The Bible in a year program has been such a blessing for us to hear God‚Äôs voice through scriptures. God bless #FrMike for being the voice that reads us God‚Äôs precious word every day of the year.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
