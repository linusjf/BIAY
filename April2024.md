### Day 92 Jesus our Redeemer

The story of Ruth is lovely, the character that Boaz shows is impeccable. Boaz does not take advantage of Ruth, when she lies down at his feet at the Threshing floor, he even makes sure that her honor is kept “He tells his servant let it not be known that she came here” He is the next in kin and there is someone before him, he offers the immediate next in kin the option to Redeem Naomi’s land and Ruth – but the offer was turned down. So, Boaz steps up and does what is needed, redeeming Naomi’s land and Ruth. Boaz and Ruth marry, and they have a son named Obed. These good people become part of the lineage of Jesus. Obed is the father of Jesse, and the grandfather of David.

Even though Ruth is a Moabitess, the good example and love of her mother-in-law influenced Ruth to be of good character. The Lord blessed her and even included her in the lineage of Jesus.

We should learn from their example and be good witnesses – genuine and true. Only a genuine love for the Lord can draw people to Christ, we will also become a path for others to find Christ, just as Ruth and Boaz become part of the lineage of Jesus.

Just like Naomi’s land and Ruth, we are also in need of redemption. We have committed sin and are in bondage of sin – we have no way to redeem ourselves with our own good deeds, and our debt to pay is very high. That is why we need Jesus, who is the first in kin – the one who will redeem us and restore us to himself. He is our bridegroom, and we are His bride.

At the start of His ministry Jesus reads proclaims that He is the promise that Isiah spoke about.

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free“ Luke 4:18

Jesus our merciful redeemer - we ask that you help us in our weakness and we offer our lives to you, please redeem and save us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
