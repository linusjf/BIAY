### Jephthah's Vow

[![Jephthah's Vow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day092.jpg)](https://youtu.be/h8yzcn23mvg "Jephthah's Vow")

### Day 92 Jesus our Redeemer

The story of Ruth is lovely, the character that Boaz shows is impeccable. Boaz does not take advantage of Ruth, when she lies down at his feet at the Threshing floor, he even makes sure that her honor is kept ‚ÄúHe tells his servant let it not be known that she came here‚Äù He is the next in kin and there is someone before him, he offers the immediate next in kin the option to Redeem Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth ‚Äì but the offer was turned down. So, Boaz steps up and does what is needed, redeeming Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth. Boaz and Ruth marry, and they have a son named Obed. These good people become part of the lineage of Jesus. Obed is the father of Jesse, and the grandfather of David.

Even though Ruth is a Moabitess, the good example and love of her mother-in-law influenced Ruth to be of good character. The Lord blessed her and even included her in the lineage of Jesus.

We should learn from their example and be good witnesses ‚Äì genuine and true. Only a genuine love for the Lord can draw people to Christ, we will also become a path for others to find Christ, just as Ruth and Boaz become part of the lineage of Jesus.

Just like Naomi‚Äôs land and Ruth, we are also in need of redemption. We have committed sin and are in bondage of sin ‚Äì we have no way to redeem ourselves with our own good deeds, and our debt to pay is very high. That is why we need Jesus, who is the first in kin ‚Äì the one who will redeem us and restore us to himself. He is our bridegroom, and we are His bride.

At the start of His ministry Jesus reads proclaims that He is the promise that Isiah spoke about.

‚ÄúThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free‚Äú Luke 4:18

Jesus our merciful redeemer - we ask that you help us in our weakness and we offer our lives to you, please redeem and save us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Strengths and Weaknesses

[![Strengths and Weaknesses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day093.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jTp4hsgYYwE "Strengths and Weaknesses")

### Day 93: Childless couples and IVF

We see the Miracle of another old couple being blessed with a child ‚Äì the parents of Samson. There are few examples in the bible ‚Äì where older parents are blessed with a child late in life - Abraham and Sarah, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and Boaz and Ruth ‚Äì fresh in our memory.

In our modern-day ‚Äì "instant culture", we see that parents who are childless get impatient and want to have a child at any cost. Now, what is wrong with parents wanting a child and demanding it as a right. The only thing wrong is that a child is a blessing from God. God is our creator and we are co-creators with Him, it was God who initially blessed human beings and said ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply‚Äù we need to remember that God is in control. But if God is for life and the parents want a child and the church is pro-life why would IVF which is life creating ‚Äì baby making ‚Äì not be accepted by the church.

The Church has many reasons for it ‚Äì it‚Äôs based on the moral law of God and His commandments.

The life of a child should always be within the context of the marital act, remember that God is present at all times in a marriage. However with IVF the process to collect the sperm and egg ‚Äì involves sinful methods and we all know that sin separates us from God. Along with the creation of a physical baby, each baby is given a soul ‚Äì there is absolutely no way the IVF process has a way to create a soul.

God in His goodness gives the baby a soul, just as God does in the cases of a child born due to rape or fornication. However, that does not mean that God approves of rape and fornication. Something to think about.

Also, IVF has cases where there are multiple embryos and a need for selective abortion.

IVF can be a sensitive topic and I am not an expert on the church‚Äôs teachings, just sharing my thoughts based on simple research.

‚ÄúI respect your opinion if it differs‚Äú

God should always be at the center of marriage, and we should be open to life and aware of His presence during the marital act. If you are a couple considering IVF, I would like you to prayerfully consider other options of adopting a deserving child or waiting on the Lord for a child, or dedicating your life more to God‚Äôs service.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Samson and Delilah

[![Samson and Delilah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day094.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-2XUUC1_Krk "Samson and Delilah")

### Day94 Samson is ruled by his desires ‚Äì Lust is blinding

The most famous judge - Samson was blessed with great strength ‚Äì he slew a thousand Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. Although he had great physical strength, he had a great weakness his lust ‚Äì we can read how Samson was time and again going after non-Israeli women and harlots.

Samson is enslaved by his lust for the Harlot Delilah. The Philistines were willing to pay a lot of money to Delilah, to entice Samson and find out where his strength lies. I cannot believe how Samson kept trusting Delilah even though she tried to have him killed 3 times. However, her nagging got to him ‚Äì Samson wanted to go back to her every day, and her words ‚Äúthat he didn‚Äôt love her‚Äù got to him and he reveals the secret about his strength in the Nazirite vow ‚Äì where he does not shave his head. She let him down again by shaving his head, they captured and gouged out his eyes, and threw him in prison. It seems like a no-brainer, one would ask, couldn‚Äôt Samson a great judge appointed by God not see the trick of Delilah. He could not he was blinded by lust, which lead him to be permanently blind -as his eyes were gorged out.

Maybe it was better for him because he called out to God and God‚Äôs spirit returned to him. He was able to kill more Philistines by pulling down the pillars.

Even Jesus warns us about the lust of the eyes, let‚Äôs hear it in Jesus' words.

27 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit adultery.‚Äô 28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. Mat 5

Let us hear Jesus‚Äô words and avoid the sin of lust of the eyes, as it blinds us. Even great people in the bible like Samson, King David, and evil people like Herod were all blinded by lust. Herod was so blind that he was lusting over his own daughter‚Äôs dance. Lust caused these characters to commit murder ‚Äì king David ordered Bathsheba‚Äôs husband to be murdered and Herod ordered the head of John the Baptist. Samson lost his mission to free the people from the Philistines. Lust can cause good men and women to do really bad things like rape, murder, fornication, etc.

A method to catch Bears is to soak a knife in blood and leave it out in the snow. The bear will find it and start licking the knife, keeping on licking the knife until its own tongue is cut. The bear goes into a frenzy and ends up licking its own blood and bleeds to death. This is the state of those who are trapped in habitual lust sins, they end up feeding on their own lustful appetites and will lose their soul.

The Lord is very merciful with those caught in traps of sin, He will free our shackles and redeem us. We can approach him who sits on the mercy seat, for he was tempted in every way possible. He does not condemn but wants to save.

15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who in every respect has been tested as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Heb 4

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Sin of Benjamin

[![The Sin of Benjamin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day095.jpg)](https://youtu.be/7gq_Sgo3dfk "The Sin of Benjamin")

### Day 95: Relativism brings Chaos

NOTE: THIS EPISODE IS PG-RATED

We see one of the lowest, most gruesome episodes of the Bible in Judges. This terrible state of lawlessness was due to the fact -

‚ÄúIn those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.‚Äù Judges 21:25

Gruesome stuff, feel overwhelmed to even summarize what happened. There was a Levite who had a concubine ‚Äì this in itself is wrong, then the concubine left the Levite and went back to her father's house. The Levite went to bring her back, however, her father prevented the Levite from leaving with his daughter(we do not know the back story -may be the Levite was ill-treating her).

They eventually left and went to the tribe of Benjamin. This is where the unthinkable happened, the evil men wanted to have relations with the Levites ‚Äì which is wrong again.

The Levite and his host acted cowardly - and pushed out the concubine. The gang of men abused her all night and she was found dead in the morning at the door. The Levite cuts up her body into pieces and sends them to all of Israel and every tribe goes up to fight against Benjamin ‚Äì which is another tribe. Now, these other tribes go into the city and kill all of the Benjaminite women. Which is also very shameful.

The whole episode is just wrong. It‚Äôs a state of Chaos!!!

The root cause of this is ‚ÄúRELATIVISM‚Äù ‚Äì every man did what is right in his own mind.

Sadly, relativism has crept into our lives today. Most people just want to do what they want. Relativism has crept into the faith circles as well. There are so many denominations that seem to interpret the bible differently and if someone is not in terms with the pastor, a new sub-division is born and a "new church" with the doctrine that they like.

Even within the catholic church ‚Äì relativism has crept in. There is a growing population that wants women priests and deacons, gay and lesbian marriages to be blessed, and many want IVF and contraception to be permitted by the catholic church. Also, some do not believe in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and some do not go to confession.

And the motto of everyone has become ‚Äúlive and let live‚Äù ‚Äì meaning you live your life according to your thoughts and I will live mine. The problem here is that people are taking the place of God and setting their own standards and beliefs, this is the reason there is division in the church, families, and society.

We need to return to the one source of truth, which is Jesus Christ. We need to adhere to the magisterium of the church, whose head is Jesus Christ. No teaching of the catholic church would be against the Bible ‚Äì God‚Äôs holy word ‚Äì but we cannot lock God in a book and say the Bible is the authority ‚Äì even the bible does not claim that.

‚ÄúThe solution to relativism is authority‚Äù - Michael Eltham üòÄ

The authority of the catholic church was instituted by Jesus when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and the promise that what would be bound on earth will be bound in heaven. In the old testament, the spiritual leaders of Israel had that role where they would bind something into law and agree and disagree on matters. Today that role is given to the catholic church, we should be so glad that our faith, teaching, and doctrine have been authorized by Jesus himself and passed down from generation to generation through the hands of many saints.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Hannah's Prayer

[![Hannah's Prayer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day096.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z4kvCO7PhEM "Hannah's Prayer")

### Day 96 Failing to correct our children

The famous parenting proverb from the bible is

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prov 13:24

Like many things in the Bible this proverb is hyperbole, I don‚Äôt think God wants us to beat our kids with a rod.

What it really means is we need to take responsibility for our kids ‚Äì young or old, we cannot ignore their mistakes, we cannot just tell them they are wrong, what we have to do is insist, pray and hopefully get them to repent.

We see Eli trying to correct his sons ‚Äì they were having relations with the women who worked at the entrance of the tent of the meeting, this is similar to committing adultery in front of the blessed sacrament, these sons of Eli have no respect for the Lord.

I guess Eli told them but they didn‚Äôt listen, Eli was old and maybe not persistent with his parenting skills. We as parents need to learn from this, if not the Lord‚Äôs favor will not rest on our family. We need to have rules and enforce them, it is easy to give in to our kids and let them do what they want. But that is not our calling or duty as parents. I remember what my mom always told me

‚ÄúIf you bring a soul into this world, you are responsible for it‚Äù Lois Eltham.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Samuel's Prophecy

Fr. Mike zeroes in on Samuel's dramatic prophecy and the tragic moment when the Philistines capture of the Ark of God. We learn that God is mighty and holds his people to a high standard. Today we read 1 Samuel 3-5 and Psalm 150.

[![Samuel's Prophecy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day097.jpg)](https://youtu.be/M7TUDSy6jVs "Samuel's Prophecy")

### Day 97 Hearing the voice of God

As we read Samuel‚Äôs story, we cannot help but dwell on his calling.

It was a time of spiritual dryness

‚Äò‚Äô In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.‚Äù 1 Sam 3:1

Samuel didn‚Äôt know who was speaking for the first 3 times, with Eli‚Äôs guidance he was able to know it was the Lord that was speaking.

The world seems to be in the same state as at that time (there were not many visions or messages from God). We meet a lot of people these days who are unable to connect with God, the noise and craziness of this world seem to be blocking out the voice of God. People are busy with so many things, especially their cell phones.

The is a new phobia/fear NOMOPHOBIA or NO MObile PHone PhoBIA is used to describe a psychological condition when people have a fear of being detached from mobile phone connectivity.

We feel the need to be connected to people - family and friends and the internet and need all the news in a flash. Sadly, we have lost the longing to hear God‚Äôs voice.

My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:John 10:27

We have failed to create an environment where we can quiet our hearts and listen to the Lord, be moved by the prompting of the Holy Spirit. We need to spend quiet time in prayer and listen to what God is speaking to us.

If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.Gal 5:25

We need to have a listening heart and constantly ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit in literally everything we do. There is no right or wrong way to listen to God‚Äôs voice, some experience it while reading the bible ‚Äì where some verses catch their attention, some experience it while waiting on the Lord in quiet adoration, some experience guidance by means of feeling peace in decisions, some get help from prayer patterns and counselors, some experience God‚Äôs guidance in the Gifts of the Holy Spirit like visions, gift of knowledge and wisdom. The method is always between you and God ‚Äì but the important thing is to make time and the right environment for God to speak to us.

The Bible in a year program has been such a blessing for us to hear God‚Äôs voice through scriptures. God bless #FrMike for being the voice that reads us God‚Äôs precious word every day of the year.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Israel Asks for a King

[![Israel Asks for a King](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day098.jpg)](https://youtu.be/fhdlWqIQ-Fo "Israel Asks for a King")

### Day 98 My will be done, my kingdom come

We pray the Our Father every day, maybe several times a day even. The 'Our father' Jesus taught us has ‚ÄúThy Kingdom come thy will be done‚Äù however we sometimes tend to do our own will instead of the will of God.
We have been studying the OT and the journey the Israelites made from Egypt to the Promised land, they had no king ‚Äì the Lord was their King, He led them out of slavery and defeated Egypt and every nation that came Israelites' way, nations far stronger than themselves.
The Lord gave them many Judges and looks like the sons of the Judges keep messing up time and again ‚Äì we saw Eli‚Äôs sons messed up a few chapters ago and the "ark of the covenant " was taken away. Now it's Samuel‚Äôs sons - they are not judging properly taking bribes and are corrupt. The people are tired of it and want a King like the other nations in the world.
The Lord is the best King, the other nations could not even hold on to the ark of the covenant they had to gracefully send it back. All the nations around knew the power of God, but the people of Israel ask for a king.
They are focusing on the world and asking God to do what they want. ‚ÄúMy will be done, my kingdom come‚Äù. They say ‚Äì other nations have a king, give us a king. They are literally asking for a replacement of God.
This could be the case with us as well, we look at the different things people have, and people do and ask the Lord ‚Äì I want it. We sometimes look at our lives and compare them to friends and others and complain that ‚Äúthey are richer‚Äù, ‚ÄúHe is healthier‚Äù, ‚ÄúShe is more beautiful than me‚Äù, and ‚Äúour neighbor's lawn is greener‚Äù. Let us seek God‚Äôs will in everything ‚Äì just like Jesus our thoughts should be
‚ÄúMy food,‚Äù said Jesus, ‚Äúis to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. John 4:34
Even when things get tough, we should persist through it. Pray as Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane - in sweat and blood.
My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will‚Äù Mat 26:39
We can pray for anything as we have a loving Father, however, if it's God‚Äôs will that we suffer or face difficulties, so be it ‚Äì let us press on and keep the faith. May our prayer be, Lord ‚ÄúThy will be done and Thy kingdom come‚Äù
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### The Word Became Flesh

[![The Word Became Flesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day099.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ksIC_YsVasA "The Word Became Flesh")

### Day 99 ‚ÄúWord became flesh‚Äù, ‚ÄúCanna symbol for resurrection‚Äù, ‚ÄúBorn again ‚Äì the right way‚Äù

WORD BECAME FLESH

Jesus has been around from the beginning ‚Äì that is even before the beginning of the world. Jesus is God ‚Äì He was with the Father and the Holy Spirit during the creation
‚ÄúLet us make mankind‚Äù Gen 1:26.
The Lord has been guiding the people of Israel through generations, God has been speaking His words ‚Äì words of love, kindness, instruction, commandments. The people are unable to perceive what God is truly like ‚Äì they are not able to related to words. That is why He send Jesus the
‚ÄúWord became flesh ‚Äú - God living among his people ‚Äì ‚ÄúEmmanuel ‚Äì God with us‚Äù
We have Jesus healing, feeding, blessing, speaking words of comfort, giving instruction, uplifting the neglected, the outcast, the widow and the orphan, the prostitute, and the tax collector. Jesus is proclaiming that
‚ÄúAll are welcome‚Äù
He is the living word of God ‚Äì Word made flesh. He proves His love for us ‚Äì love that is greater than any other love ‚Äì He dies for us ‚Äì while we were yet sinners.
CANNA IS A SYMBOL OF HIS RESURRECTION
First off we learn that we have a Mother who intercedes for us, she was concerned when the wine ran out, she has been given to us at the cross
‚ÄúBehold your mother‚Äù
so rest assured of her watchfulness and intercession in our lives. This was an earthly sign of her heavenly role in bringing our needs to her son.
The wedding at Canna was the first miracle that Jesus performed, it is very significant as it symbolizes His resurrection. The very first line gives us a big hint
‚ÄúOn the third day there was a marriage at Canna in Galilee‚Äù John 2:1
Let‚Äôs break it down
‚Äì we are all familiar with the third day Jesus rose on the third day - we are all familiar with the wedding feast of the bridegroom (Jesus) and the church (his bride)
‚Äì The location ‚Äì Galilee is key ‚Äì this is where Jesus meets all the disciples after the resurrection ‚Äì
(Mark 16 ‚ÄúBut go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him as he told you‚Äù)
Jesus here is turning water into wine ‚Äì symbolic for changing the water ‚Äì OT rituals into the gift of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. Water can be symbolized as an earthly or human effort of following the law and Spirit can be symbolized as heavenly ‚Äì Led by the Spirit we are able to live a holy life. Also symbolic of the great sacrifice of the lamb ‚Äì Jesus Christ is the lamb ‚Äì Wine changes to Blood ‚Äì which takes away the sin of the world.
BORN AGAIN
Unlike the common definition of born again ‚Äì ‚ÄúBelieve in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved‚Äù
Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again,
‚ÄúVery truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.‚Äù John 3:5
Water & Spirit
We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.
2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again ‚Äì we have the theme of water and Spirit.
3. We see the Israelites crossing the red sea (water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.
   Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.
4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land
5. Jesus was baptized ‚Äì in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.
6. So you are being saved by BAPTISM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)
7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)
8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession
9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus' Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### Day 99 - George Vysamparambil

John 2:1 the third day: Chronologically this refers to the third day since Jesus' encounter with Nathanael (1:43-51). Theologically, it has 2 levels of significance

1. The third day is actually the 7th day of Jesus' opening week of ministry.  The evangelist hints at this when he delineates the successive days in 1:29, 35, 43 and 2:1 implying that the creation fashioned in 7 days (Gen 1:1-2:3) is being transformed and renewed through Jesus ( 2 Cor 5:17, Rev 21:1-5)

2. Jesus manifests his glory on the 3rd day at Cana 2:11 just as he reveals his glory by rising on the 3rd day after his death ( 1 Cor 15:4)

2:4 - woman - Although it might offend the standards of modern etiquette , this was a title of respect and endearment in antiquity  (4:21, 8:10, 20:13). Woman is used to refer to Gen 3:15. Genesis 3 is the reverse image of the Cana episode . As Eve prompted Adam to defy the Lord and drag the human family into sin, so Mary (New Eve) prompts the new Adam ( Jesus) to initiate his mission of salvation

2:6 - 6 stone jars: The purpose of these water jars is outlined in Num 19:11-22 which stipulates that any Israelite defiled by contact with the dead must be purified with water on the 3rd day, then again on the 7th day. Curiously the Cana miracle takes place on the 3rd day which according to John's chronology is also the 7th day. The 1st sign performed by Jesus (water into wine) recalls the first sign performed by Moses ( the first plague, water into blood Ex 7:19) . Note that wine is called the blood of grapes in Hebrew poetry ( Gen 49:11, Deut 32:14). 6 water jars refers to the OT rituals which cleans a person from outside and cannot save a man fully. Jesus changing water into wine refers to the New testament which cleans a person from inside and fully saves a person. Jesus changes water into wine and then later on changes wine into his blood. By consuming his body and blood, we are being fully saved. 6 is an incomplete number whereas 7 is complete according to Hebrew numerology. There are 6 water jars which is incomplete just like our life. But when Jesus changes water into wine, he becomes the 7th jar just like our life which becomes complete with Jesus.

The wedding of Adam and Eve takes place on the 7th day just like the wedding at Cana which takes on the 3rd day which is also the 7th day since 4 days have passed in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, there is no mention of the bride and bridegroom, it signifies the Wedding of the Lamb. Jesus is the Bridegroom and Mother Mary is the bride (representative of the Church).

### Day 100 The Eucharist ‚Äì True presence not symbolic

We read about Jesus meeting a Samaritan woman at the well. Whenever there is a scene in the OT where a man meets a woman at the well‚Äì its symbolic of the proposal for marriage(Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel and Moses and Ziphora) ‚Äì also note that the Bible states that they meet at Jacob‚Äôs well ‚Äì is possibly the well where Jacob met Rebekah. That is why the disciples were shocked to see Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman ‚Äì however, they did not want to ask him anything (they must have been hoping Jesus wasn‚Äôt thinking of marrying a Samaritan woman).

If you think of it Jesus was actually proposing marriage - the Samaritan women represent us ‚Äì ‚Äúfallen humankind‚Äù. We have tried everything but have no fulfillment ‚Äì she married 5 men and was living with the sixth ‚Äì we have tried to be fulfilled by everything that the 5 senses offer ‚Äì but still are not satisfied. Jesus promised her ‚Äúliving waters‚Äù ‚Äì the Holy Spirit that will become in her a wellspring of salvation. She and we will never be thirsty again.

In order to have this life of fulness ‚Äì Jesus gives us a method, a means to Heavenly food and drink ‚Äì He gives us Himself ‚Äì Jesus is the new Manna ‚Äì the bread that came down from heaven.

Jesus is taking the promise forward ‚Äì the promise He made to the Samaritan women and to us. He says we will never hunger or never thirst if we eat His body and drink His blood.

35 Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúI am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. John 6

Jesus repeats the importance of the Eucharist 5 times in the discourse. Many people dismiss this teaching and say that Jesus is just referring to reading His word ‚Äì Jesus is very clear here about eating and drinking ‚Äì he does not mean it symbolically or as a metaphor ‚Äì because he repeated it 5 times ‚Äì clarifying it each time they murmured ‚Äì they murmured about who He was ‚Äì ‚Äúwe know his father Joseph and his mother Mary ‚Äì how can he say I came from heaven‚Äù

They murmured about eating flesh and drinking blood ‚Äì because it was forbidden according to the Jewish custom.

Each time Jesus replied with strong words ‚Äì the Greek captures it better than the English translation ‚Äì the Greek word used for ‚Äòflesh‚Äô ‚Äì denotes real physical flesh or soft tissue and the word for eat ‚Äì translates to ‚Äògnaw‚Äô and ‚Äòmunch‚Äô ‚Äì its could be understood as ‚Äúmasticating the flesh‚Äù. Most of Jesus' disciples and followers left at this teaching ‚Äì this is the only time they left due to doctrinal issues.

Jesus never told them ‚Äì STOP ‚Äì I‚Äôm just speaking symbolically. Many are murmuring even today, many are leaving the faith and many are Leaving the catholic church over this teaching. Remember Jesus told us to remember Him by eating His body and drinking blood - in the last supper.

The Eucharist is the true body and blood of Jesus. Of course, it is hard to eat real flesh and real blood and it is impossible for us to live if God reveals Himself in full glory to us. That is why Jesus has pity on us and is present in the form of humble bread and wine.

The term is Transubstantiation - the change by which the substance (though not the appearance) of the bread and wine in the Eucharist becomes Christ‚Äôs real presence‚Äîthat is, his body and blood.

We can thank a doctor of the Church ‚Äì a great Theologian ‚Äì Thomas Aquinas for this. A lot of time and space needs to be dedicated to understanding it.

As far as the argument about ‚ÄòIt is the Spirit that gives life; the flesh is of no avail‚Äô ‚Äì Jesus is referring to the human flesh or weakness ‚Äì earlier he said eat my flesh and in this verse, he says the flesh is of no avail. If Jesus said 5 times that His flesh brings life ‚Äì why would he say flesh is of no avail, he means our human nature/flesh.

Let these words that Jesus said stay in our thoughts. Unless we eat His body and drink His blood we have no life in us. When Jesus says truly truly ‚Äì He really means it.

‚ÄúSo Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúVery truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.‚Äù John 6:53

Even though it may not be fully clear to you today or if you have doubts or if you are murmuring about it ‚Äì pray as Peter prayed.

‚ÄúLord where can we go for you have the words of eternal life.‚Äù

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Signs and Wonders

[![Signs and Wonders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day101.jpg)](https://youtu.be/QDP4X_c8kcQ "Signs and Wonders")

### Day 101 Jesus and His Mercy for the women caught in adultery

As we read the story of the women caught in adultery we can‚Äôt help but awe at the Mercy of God. First off Jesus sees deeper, He knows our hearts. He knew the hidden motive of the Pharisees, who wanted to actually trap Jesus.
First of all, it is not easy to catch someone in the act of adultery, people seek privacy for the marital act ‚Äì so much more for adultery. So for the Pharisees to find the women in the act would actually mean they have been looking to catch them and they did not find them by accident.
The second question is ‚Äúwhere is the man?‚Äù, the law was to stone both of them, not just the women. Maybe the elders were trying to frame this poor woman or even if they actually caught her in the act ‚Äì they are being very partial to the man.
While the elders stand with raised stones and with wrath in their hearts, looking down on the woman. Jesus on the other hand bends down and writes on the sand, Jesus humbles himself to the level of the woman and looks at her with Mercy ‚Äì does not look down on her.
As the men press on for Jesus to condemn and stone her, Jesus writes on the dust ‚Äì the word of God does not specify what He wrote ‚Äì however there are some assumptions we can make

1. At creation we know what happened when God touched dust and breathed on it ‚Äì "man was created".
   7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.Gen 2: 7
   Here Jesus is God touching dust again ‚Äì He is creating a new opportunity for the women - a brand new life ‚Äì He makes everything new ‚Äì wipes her slate clean and gives her a new chance at life.
2. The other time God‚Äôs finger touched the earth, He write laws on the stone tablets. Jesus - God is writing again - maybe the laws ‚Äì maybe even writing the new law ‚Äì the old law said if you commit adultery ‚Äì the new law Jesus gave is ‚Äúeven if you look at a woman with lust you have committed adultery in your heart‚Äù so maybe the elder who caught the women in the act ‚Äì lusted over her. They could not throw a stone anymore as they would need to be stoned as well.
   MY DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ‚Äì BE ENCOURAGED AND NOT DISCOURAGED ‚Äì ‚ÄúGOD IS MERCIFUL‚Äù.
   He came not to condemn but to save. He came to forgive us or not to judge us like a merciless judge. He is a Merciful Judge that has compassion for broken creatures like us.
   May we also be like Jesus, quick to forgive and slow to judge and condemn.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 101 - George Vysamparambil

8:8 wrote ....on the ground: What Jesus inscribed in the dirt is unknown but probably symbolic. The gesture may recall Jer 17:13, a warning that those who forsake the Lord "shall be written in the earth" because they have rejected the "fountain of living water". The Pharisees fall into this category for rejecting Jesus, who has just been identified as the source of "living water" (7:38). Christ, who twice bends down to write on the ground, teaches us to bend low in humility to examine ourselves both before and after addressing the faults of our neighbour. If his example becomes our pratice, we will avoid as he did the extremes of being unjust and unmerciful toward others

### Day 102: The Good Shepherd

The promise of the Good Shepherd from the OT in Psalm 23 ‚ÄúThe Lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want‚Äù is fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus proclaims that in today‚Äôs Gospel

‚ÄúI am the good shepherd ‚Äì the one who lays down His life for the sheep‚Äù. John 10:11

The good shepherd cares for the sheep ‚Äì He feeds them in green pastures, by quiet waters.

He leads them on the right path, protects them in the dark valley.

The shepherd also corrects and comforts the sheep with His rod and staff.

When a sheep goes astray ‚Äì He goes in search of the sheep ‚Äì and finds it and carries it back home. He restores their soul ‚Äì forgives their sins - washes them in His blood and makes them whole.

There is rejoicing in heaven over every sheep that is found ‚Äì He anoints our head with oil, prepares a banquet, our cup is overflowing, surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life, and on the day we pass from this world to the next ‚Äì we will go in though Him - for He said

‚ÄúI am the door of the sheep, if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture‚Äù John 10: 9

We have to teach our hearts and mind to listen to Him and follow Him. We also should be aware of the voice of the evil one ‚Äì who only wants to rob, steal, and destroy us. We should set time for silent listening every day and also be aware of the promptings and the nudges of the Holy Spirit throughout the day.

God wants us to give us life in abundance and he also tells us that there are many who need to come into the flock. Everyone needs to hear His voice in prayer and hear Him as we read the Bible. We need to experience the life-giving word of God. Just as Lazarus came to life just by hearing Jesus‚Äôs voice, we need to come alive in many areas of our life as we hear God‚Äôs voice spoken to us.

All we need to do is pay attention to His voice and stay close to Him, He will provide, protect, guide, and lead us to the safe bosom of Abba Father.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Judas' Secrecy

[![Judas' Secrecy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day103.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kT8pVB6I4GE "Judas' Secrecy")

### Day 103: ‚ÄúWashing of the feet ‚Äì anointing, priesthood, and service‚Äù ‚ÄúAbiding in God‚Äù

It is indeed a moving scene; a Rabbi or teacher washes the feet of the disciples. One important thing that we may miss is the washing of the feet was an important part of the ordination of the priest in the OT.

‚ÄúThen you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting, and shall wash them with water, and put upon Aaron the holy garments, and you shall anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve me as priest‚Äù (Exod. 40:12-13).

The washing of the feet is also a great call to service for every Christian. We are not called to be served but to serve ‚Äì following the example Jesus set for us - we need to wash each other‚Äôs feet. Just as the title of the pope is Servant of Servants. We are called to be servant leaders ‚Äì not Lording it over ‚Äì but serving with Love and Humility ‚Äì putting the interest of others first.

To be able to serve, we would need to be grounded and connected to the Vine. On our own it is impossible if a branch decides to separate from the Vine ‚Äì it withers and dries up. In the same way, if we take on Service as something we do with all the resources we have, we will fall short of the goal, we will dry up and exhaust.

We need to receive our nourishment from the Vine from Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúbody, blood, soul and divinity‚Äù in the Holy Eucharist we receive. Just as the branch receives sap from the root, we need to receive our spiritual food from Jesus the source of everything good.

St Mother Theresa of Calcutta would spend 1 hour in holy adoration every day before she went out to serve the poor. If she had a very busy day, she would spend 2 hours before going out ‚Äì she believed that she needed more nourishment before she could do more.

May the Lord be our nourishment in the Eucharist ‚Äì ‚Äúthe source and summit of the Christian life.‚Äù CCC 1324

### The Priestly Prayer of Jesus

[![The Priestly Prayer of Jesus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day104.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Tep60Vbs1hs "The Priestly Prayer of Jesus")

### Day 104 This is the time of the Holy Spirit

In the Old Testament all focus was on the God the Father ‚Äì ‚ÄúAbba‚Äù, during the earthly life of Jesus ‚Äì all focus was on Jesus. Now it‚Äôs the time of the Holy Spirit, that is why we hear Jesus saying the words

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.  John 61:7

Now when I say, ‚Äúthis is the time of the Holy Spirit‚Äù I do not mean that the Father and the son are forgotten. The Father, Son, and Spirit are so united ‚Äì that they are always working together and in perfect union. What it means is that in the Old Testament only a few were anointed and experienced the Holy Spirit, only the prophets, Kings. However, when Jesus dies and rises to Heaven ‚Äì He can send the Holy Spirit to everyone ‚Äì the Spirit will empower us to do the works Jesus did and even greater works.

We all know what happened at Pentecost and we read about the working of the Holy Spirit in the acts of the Apostles. The apostles spoke of the Holy Spirit as being present with them as a real person. Reading the below verse reflects it.

For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials: Acts 15:28

It‚Äôs like saying Tom and Harry felt good about buying a property and they did. The Holy Spirit was real and a person who they could talk to and listen to.

That is why St Paul would give blessings like ‚Äúfellowship of the Holy Spirit‚Äù

14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. 2 Cor 13:14

The Holy Spirit has been forgotten or limited to an image of a dove or fire. But the Holy Spirit is a person, the third person of the Holy Trinity.

The Holy Spirit is gentle and not imposing if we welcome the Holy Spirit into our lives ‚Äì we will become children of God.

For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. Rom 8:14

The Holy Spirit pours God‚Äôs love into our hearts.

God‚Äôs love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. Rom 5:5

Thank God for the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, I was introduced to the Holy Spirit. Earlier I thought it was just a dove, but now the Holy Spirit is my Advocate, Councilor, comforter, guide, helper, Convicter of Sin, Intercessor, Teacher, revealer of truth and constant companion.

May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### It Is Finished

[![It Is Finished](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day105.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pPWnWUPUxik "It Is Finished")

### Day 105 ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù

In final moments of Jesus‚Äôs crucifixion, He says these words ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù just before the final words ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù. Many saints have meditated on these last words of Jesus and we should to. what does Jesus thirst for? Is it for souls?
St Mother Teresa spent her whole live trying to comfort Jesus who thirsts for us.
"I thirst" is something much deeper than Jesus just saying "I love you." Until you know deep inside that Jesus thirsts for you - you can't begin to know who He wants to be for you. Or who He wants you to be for Him. The heart and soul of \[Missionaries of Charity\] is only this - the thirst of Jesus' Heart, hidden in the poor. ... "I thirst" and "You did it to me" - remember always to connect the two. - St Mother Teresa
Mother Teresa spent a whole life serving and her whole congregation are now serving the poor, they see Jesus in the poor and the hungry, those who thirst and those who hunger ‚Äì are feed.
St Faustina united her suffering with the Passion of Christ in order that sinful souls are given the strength to repent.
During Holy Mass, I saw the Lord Jesus nailed upon the cross amidst great torments. A soft moan issued from His Heart. After some time, He said: I thirst. i thirst for the salvation of souls. Help Me, My daughter, to save souls. Join your sufferings to My Passion and offer them to the heavenly Father for sinners (Diary, 1032). - Saint Faustina.
We need to do two things to satisfy the thirst of Jesus.
Repent of our sins and welcome Jesus into our hearts.
Pray for the world and for sinners to repent.
Jesus thirst for us, He thirst for our time, He thirst for our will, He thirsts also to comfort us, to give us rest, He thirsts to come into our hearts and dine with us.
20 Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me. Rev 3:20
My dear brothers and sisters, do not harden your hearts, pray and welcome Jesus into you lives. He thirsts to come into your hearts and your lives. He thirsts for you to receive Him at Mass, so he can enter you and fill you with love and wholeness.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Saul Is Chosen

[![Saul Is Chosen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day106.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8XfBeZFhNnE "Saul Is Chosen")

### Day 106 Do not only go with "Outwardly appearances" ‚Äì do not be fooled

Over the generations, they have been many sayings like ‚ÄúAll that glitters is not gold‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo not judge the book by the cover‚Äù do you remember any such saying/quotes?
In today‚Äôs readings, we read the story of Saul, on the outward, he seemed like the perfect candidate to be the first King of Israel.
There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; he stood head and shoulders above everyone else. 1 Sam 9:2
Outwardly he was the most handsome man in all of Israel, the tallest and strongest. However inwardly he was fearful and insecure, looking at his own strengths and weaknesses.
‚ÄúAm I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?‚Äù 1 Sam 21
He questions his ability, his background, his family, from where he comes. We all will remember that the Benjaminite tribe was the tribe that was attached to all the other tribes of Israel ‚Äì because the Benjaminite tribe raped the concubine of the priest, the priest cut her body into pieces and send it to all the tribes. All the tribes attached Benjaminite tribe and killed all the women there. Then the Benjaminites were kidnapping virgins from other tribes to marry them as there were no women left in their tribe.
Even after Saul was anointed when they were going to install him as King, he was hiding in the luggage.
‚ÄúBehold, he has hidden himself among the baggage‚Äù 1 Sam 10: 22
Even in the proverb that we read today we are reminded to not be attracted to loose women.
‚ÄúFor the lips of loose women drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.‚Äù Prov 5:4
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Prov 31:30
We can expand this warning from just being about loose women to anything that seems attractive to us. The lust of the eyes, where we lust over things of the world, lust for people, things, experiences, whatever we seem to be attracted to - that reduces our love for God.
Another scripture that emphasizes this is
Do not let your adorning be external‚Äîthe braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear‚Äî but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. 1 Pet 3:3-4
We are called to look at the person's heart and not just the outward appearance. Look at the internal beauty, the beauty of the soul.
In everything, we need to go after things that are good, pleasing, and truly good.
8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Phil 4:8
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

[![Samuel's Speech](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day107.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vBMNpTla9zM "Samuel's Speech")

### Day 107 God allows us to have our way, if we insist ‚Äì His permissible will

The Lord has been very patient with the Israelites, brought them out of slavery, and defeated the Egyptians and every kingdom/people who came in their way to the promised land. Yet the stiff-necked people say, ‚ÄúGive us a king‚Äù, God warns them of the difficulties they would face under the king‚Äôs rule. The people just won‚Äôt have it, they want a king. They want to replace God‚Äôs direct guidance with a human king. Remember the Lord was their King ‚Äì He was leading and governing them ‚Äì through the prophets Moses, Joshua, and the many judges.
God said so be it, if these people are so insistent ‚Äì let us give them a king.
However, this is not God‚Äôs perfect will for Israel but a permissible will. When Israel choose not to pick God‚Äôs perfect will - God did not abandon them, He give them a second chance. He says here through Samuel.
14 If you will fear the Lord and serve him and hearken to his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God, it will be well; 1 Sam 12:14
So it is with us, that God has plans for our lives. He loves us and knows everything about us, when we sit down and when we rise up when we come in and go out, all our days are in His hand. God has called us and appointed us to do certain things on earth.
We sometimes are unaware of how to discern God‚Äôs voice(Samuel did not know who was calling him in the temple), sometimes caught up in sin, sometimes know what God whats of us but just do not have the willpower to do it.
For Example, God has a plan for a young man Joe to become a priest. Joe loves to pray and go to church regularly, Joe even feels drawn to the priesthood. However Joe has bad friends, they constantly take him away from Church. He eventually ends up marrying one of his friends. Joe and his wife were never meant to be together, they end up fighting and are on the verge of divorce.
Joe turns back to God, what would God do?
If you answered, ‚ÄúGod would give them a second chance‚Äù ‚Äì you are right ‚Äì God would help Joe and his wife by either leading them to the right marriage counselor or God would supernaturally give them more love and patience. God's ways are not our ways. After Joe‚Äôs marriage is restored, God would possibly lead Joe into lay ministry ‚Äì so Joe will be able to serve God. Of course, not at the capacity, God wanted for Joe, but at a capacity, Joe was able to. The Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Our God is a God of second chances, just because we did not do what God had in store for us ‚Äì He will never leave us. In fact, He will leave the 99 good sheep and come in search of us.
God eventually did give us a king who was Human. It was Jesus ‚Äì fully human and fully God. God‚Äôs plan of being our king and our demand to have a human king was merged into Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 107

In today's study we see the lsraelites had no Leader and frequently fell prey to other nations because of their failure to trust and obey their God. They want to replace God's guidance with a king.
In the beginning, Saul as an appointed king, was one of humility and was able to rule God's people. He was to administer the Lord's Covenant. The Prophet Samuel was to give Spiritual Counsel as well as Divine lnstructions.
A strong warning was given to the people and Samuel concluded encouraging them that God would not forsake His people and Samuel would not cease to pray for them.
The Psalm, a betrayal, hurts the most. Our Lord faced the same heartbreak when Judas betrayed Him.

### Day 108 - Jenita

When you do the right thing in life... No matter what the law or situation is.. It will turn favorable to you. When the people of Israel knew they had to fight they hid themselves. But Jonathan and his armor bearer, stood up and fought for the people and that brave act of his saved his life from his father.
How many of us have the mind to stand up and do something about a complex situation?

Saul makes a rash vow, which puts his son's life in jeopardy. Sometimes we land up making such rash vows without thinking through the consequences of the decisions we make. We must ensure we never make decisions out of emotions but only after a good thought process about the entire situation.

Let us learn to be like Jonathan who is willing to fight the battle no one was willing to fight.

### Day 108 Saul is ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù and ‚Äútoo rash‚Äù for his own good

Let us put ourselves in the shoes or sandals(hehe) of an Israelite ‚Äì We have demanded a King and we now have an anointed King Saul. We are not getting ready for battle, look at your weapons ‚Äì you have no sword, no armor just your farm tools. You are a farmer and are used to cultivating the land ‚Äì you are now asked to bring those farming tools and fight the Philistine army. The army has big, strong, strapping giant-like warriors. The army is so huge it‚Äôs like sand on the seashore.
What would you do? Would you fight or hide in a hole?
Now you have a prophet Samuel who is supposed to come and offer sacrifice and ask for God‚Äôs favor ‚Äì for it was the Lord who won all the previous battles for you. Samuel does not show up, you get scared and scatter.
Now for a second Imagine you are Saul the king who sees his weak peasant army hiding, what would you do??
Saul cannot handle it ‚Äì he Jumps the gun. He disobeys God, he offers the sacrifice himself. Saul seems to be acting out of fear.
Samuel comes and announces that Saul‚Äôs reign is over, he will not rule forever. That his son Jonathan will not be the next King.
I feel sad for Jonathan, he is a hero, a fearless warrior. Now there are only two swords in all of Isreal ‚Äì Saul has one ‚Äì too scared to use it, I guess. Johnathan has the other sword - He has faith, he has courage, He has a heart of a warrior, knowing that if God is for us who can be against us.
Johnathan jumps into action ‚Äì attacks and kills 20 men, this causes chaos and the whole army is overturned. God uses the faith of Johnathan to defeat a huge army of great warriors.
Saul in his rash ‚Äì swears an oath ‚Äì that no one should eat the honey on the ground, Johnathon unknowing of the oath eats it. Johnathan‚Äôs eyes are brightened, but Saul won‚Äôt have it ‚Äì he wants to kill his own son, the warrior son who won him the battle. The people are tired of Saul‚Äôs craziness, they ransom Johnathan.
We can learn not to operate out of fear, not to act in haste, don‚Äôt make rash decisions. Allow God to act, and when you feel inspired ‚Äì throw yourself out there ‚Äì God will take care of you as he did for Johnathan. God is looking at your hearts, he wants leaders to be after His own heart. God will fight for us if we are willing to die for Him.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### A Heart of Obedience

[![A Heart of Obedience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day109.jpg)](https://youtu.be/tXiEIfY6Mxo "A Heart of Obedience")

### Day 109 Obedience is greater than sacrifice

We see how Saul is messing up again and again - doing what He likes. He orders that they keep the good stuff from the spoil, even though the Lord warned against it. Saul keeps all of the cattle and even offers some of them to the Lord.
Samuel is furious about it, He asks Saul this very important question.
‚ÄúHas the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obedience to the voice of the Lord? Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.
For rebellion is no less a sin than divination, and stubbornness is like iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has also rejected you from being king.‚Äù 1 Sam 15:22
The reason why Saul is rejected is that He just does not want to listen to God‚Äôs instructions. Disobedient, rebellious, and stubborn he is rejecting God‚Äôs word.
Remember Adam and Even got thrown out of Eden because of their disobedience, they just thought that they knew better than God.
Saul looked at the spoil ‚Äì it was pleasing to the eye, good for the body, so He consumed it and even offered it to God.
Let us learn not to be disobedient, rebellious, and stubborn ‚Äì let us listen to God‚Äôs word and act on it. Let us build our lives according to God‚Äôs instruction from His word. God does not look at the outward appearance, He looks at the heart. God does not want our sacrifices and our charity, He wants us, God wants our hearts.
That is why God chose David and rejected his elder brothers who were strong and good-looking like Saul. God looked at David‚Äôs heart and knew that David had it in him to slay the giant, David had a heart that was attuned to the worship of God.
David had praise on his lips and used his talent (music) to glorify God.
We need to cultivate the habit of listening to and singing/playing spiritual music, we see the power it has in driving out evil spirits from Saul.
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè

### David and Goliath

[![David and Goliath](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day110.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ehmV56hG3C0 "David and Goliath")

### Day 110 - Jenita

David's intention to fight Goliath was not for his ego or pride but because of the insults of Goliath against God. He wanted to fight for the glory of God.

How many of us fight our battles for our own ego.. How many unnecessary battles have we fought to feed our ego.

When we work for the glory of God.. Everything will fall in place such that we will be able to defeat our giants with much ease.

### Day 110 Facing giants

The story of David slaying Goliath is almost every kid‚Äôs favorite Bible story. Not just the kids, everyone loves a story where the underdog defeats the champion ‚Äì there are many famous movies/books with this concept.
Goliath was terrorizing Saul's army for 40 days(40 refers to a long time). No one from the army was willing to fight the giant. All of David‚Äôs strong brothers were in the army, but none of them were willing to take on the Giant.
David comes in and cannot digest the fact that his brothers and all of the Israelites are so afraid. I can almost hear him yell -
For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?‚Äù 1 Sam 17:26
The thing that inspired David to fight was that the Lord‚Äôs name was being humiliated and that no one was doing anything about it.
David did not keep quiet, he started talking and trying to get some Israelites fired up to fight Goliath. David‚Äôs words reached Saul, now we know that Saul is fearful and keep hiring strong men to protect him.
I can‚Äôt imagine how David spoke the below words to King Saul(stronger and taller) and his band of hired strong men.
‚ÄúLet no one‚Äôs heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.‚Äù 1 Sam 17:32
David relies on God, the God who protected him against the wild lion and bears. David was self-training when he was doing his assigned task of caring for the sheep. David here is a pre-figuration of Jesus ‚Äì the good shepherd who did not fear death.
David knows for a fact that the Lord who protected him against the wild animals will protect him against Goliath.
Saul out of fear ‚Äì tries to put on his own armor on David ‚Äì but doesn‚Äôt fit. David is fearless, he picks up 5 smooth stones and a sling. Even if David has to go with just his bare hands he would have won, because David was not relying on his own ability but on the Lord.
‚ÄúYou come to me with sword and spear and javelin; but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 1 Sam 17:45
David did not go only with his own strength; He had the Lord on his side. As David swung that pebble ‚Äì it was the Lord‚Äôs mighty hand that guided it with so much force that Goliath a might warrior fell to the ground.
When we face giants in our lives, giants of sickness, sin, addictions, bad relationships, financial situations, spiritual darkness, we have to say those words of David ‚Äì ‚ÄúI come in the name of the Lord‚Äù and even if we have faith as small as a mustard seed, the mountains will move, the giants will fall. Even if the giants have been jeering at us for a long time. We will be victorious, not by our strength but by the Lord.
Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,‚Äô saith the Lord of hosts. Zechariah 4:6
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### DAY 110: Sheela

Once again Saul achieves victory by relying on himself, the challenge of a more than nine-foot-tall Giant, instead of GOD.
The success of David was not his own. David put his faith in God. God was the source of David's accomplishment.
The Psalmist felt that no good and faithful individual existed in his world. God is not watching us with grade book in hand, to pass or fail us. When testing comes we become aware and like the Psalmist cry for deliverance. God shows us where we must, yet, yield to Him in trusting obedience and mercy.

### Saul Tries to Kill David

[![Saul Tries to Kill David](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day111.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KfWA1ZLVHN0 "Saul Tries to Kill David")

### Day 111 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Samuel 18:1 & 4
*By the time David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bound to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own self.*

When David killed Goliath and thus saved Israel from oppression and slavery under the enemy, Saul‚Äôs son, Jonathan, recognized the great significance of David's victory and it affected him personally.  Jonathan knew that he would have never been able to defeat the giant so he accepted that fact that he owed his entire existence to the one who defeated the giant.  Therefore, Jonathan's heart was overwhelmed with relief and his soul was knit to David, and Jonathan loved David as his own self.
Jonathan's relationship with David was a picture of a believer's relationship with Jesus.

When a person truly understands the spiritual misery and suffering of enslavement to Satan, such a person will feel a similar attachment to Christ and will follow Christ faithfully, knowing that he/she owes their entire existence to Jesus, the one and only person who could defeat the spiritual Goliath (Satan).

*Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and handed it over to David, along with his military dress, even his sword, bow, and belt.*

By handing over his robe, military garments, sword, bow and belt to David, Jonathan surrendered himself completely to David.

As it was with Jonathan and David, so it must be with us and Christ.

### Day 111 Saul Envy is making him evil, treacherous, and murderous

Envy is a deadly sin, it‚Äôs one of the 7 deadly sins. Envy is described in the Catechism of the Catholic Church
Envy is a capital sin. It refers to the sadness at the sight of another's goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself, even unjustly. When it wishes grave harm to a neighbor it is a mortal sin:
St. Augustine saw envy as "the diabolical sin." "From envy are born hatred, detraction, calumny, joy caused by the misfortune of a neighbor, and displeasure caused by his prosperity." CCC 2539
The 9th and 10th commandment warns us against envy, - do not covet your neighbor's wife or goods.
2538 The tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from the human heart.
We see King Saul being tormented with the sin of Envy; Saul has an eye on David. Saul's son Jonathan has this great friendship with David and tries to make peace between David and Saul. David does not hesitate to fight any battle that Saul puts him in. However, when David came back victorious the people rejoiced and celebrated. They said:
‚ÄúSaul has slain his thousands, And David his Ten thousands‚Äù 1 Sam 18:7
This made Saul very angry and this saying displeased him. So Saul tries to kill David when David was playing the lyre. Saul tried a few times over, but with no success. So Saul plots to send him to battle the Philistines ‚Äì thinking that David will be killed at the battle. This does not work as well ‚Äì David came back victorious.
Then David promises his elder daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage but when the time comes he marries her off to someone else.
Then Saul finds out that his younger daughter Michal loves Saul, he wanted to trick David again, he asked David to get 100 foreskins of Philistines as a marriage gift, and David gets 200. Once David marries Michal ‚Äì Saul attempts to kill him again, but Michal rescues him. We can clearly see that Saul‚Äôs envy has become toxic, he has become evil, treacherous, and murderous, and evil spirits are controlling Saul.
We need to keep envy in check, even when it‚Äôs little, like small jealousy towards our friends and neighbors. Because even the best of us can fall prey to envy. David who was such a good example of keeping envy away and showing mercy towards Saul, David falls into the sin of envy himself. In future episodes, we will see how David will lust for Bathsheba and act out of envy. David will do the same envious acts that Saul did to David, David will send Bathsheba‚Äôs husband to fight in front and die just so that David can get what he is eyeing from the roof.
Let us pray for the grace to always be satisfied with what we have, let us not try to keep up with the Joneses. Let us thank God for what we have and lavish on the good things we have rather than envy what we don‚Äôt.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### True Friendship

[![True Friendship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day112.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YBUjo2zjE_0 "True Friendship")

### Day 112 A Faithful Friend is a treasure

Family is given to us, but Friends are our choice. It is very important to choose the correct friends for they can save our lives or ruin them.
We see the friendship of David and Jonathan, they were true friends. They both had faith and courageous hearts, they were ready to do anything for the Lord. Jonathan has tried to unite his father Saul and David but to no avail. Jonathan is willing to stand up for David to the point where Saul even throws a spear at him. Jonathan was a true friend because he was ready to risk his own life for his friend David.
We have a true friend in Jesus, who while we were yet sinners He died for us. Jesus is our true friend because he gave us everything, he stood up for us even to the point of death.
There is no greater love than to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.John 15:13
If we don‚Äôt spend time with our friends we will never grow deep in friendship.
It‚Äôs the same with our relationship with Jesus, we need to spend time praying, talking, and listening to His word and to His promptings. We need to talk to Jesus about every little thing that happens to us and know that He is with us every moment of the day and night.
We should also pray for good friends for us and good friends for our children/grandchildren. We should look for friends who have faith, friends who are faithful, friends who we can depend on, and share our burdens and joys. Friends who we can celebrate our life events with. Not friends with benefits or friends who can do us a favor, we need true friendships ‚Äì where there is no judgment.
We should find a friend who is closer than a brother, not friends who will ruin us.
One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. Prov 18:24
These verses from Sirach are true wisdom, let them be our guide to find those friends, that are a sturdy shelter, the faithful friends who are a treasure.
Friendship, False and True
5 Pleasant speech multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies. 6 Let those who are friendly with you be many, but let your advisers be one in a thousand. 7 When you gain friends, gain them through testing, and do not trust them hastily. 8 For there are friends who are such when it suits them, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 9 And there are friends who change into enemies, and tell of the quarrel to your disgrace. 10 And there are friends who sit at your table, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 11 When you are prosperous, they become your second self, and lord it over your servants; 12 but if you are brought low, they turn against you, and hide themselves from you. 13 Keep away from your enemies, and be on guard with your friends.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also.
Sirach 6:51-17
May we be Jesus‚Äôs true friend, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts.
May we also find true spiritual friends in this world.
And ‚Äúyes‚Äù we are all true friends in the BIAY group ‚Äì praying for each other and growing in our friendship with Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Broken Trust

[![Broken Trust](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day113.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YFVnETlkils "Broken Trust")

### Day 113 ‚ÄúCrossing the limit‚Äù to succeed.

We read about David and his men, eating the bread of the presence as they had nothing else to eat as they were fleeing Saul. We also need the bread of the presence ‚Äì Eucharist to strengthen us on our journey.
Saul finds out about it and is perusing David, he is furious and wants to find out who helped David. When no one answered ‚Äì ‚ÄúDoeg‚Äù ceased the opportunity to please the King. Doeg tells Saul that Ahimelech was the one who helped David. Saul wanted his servants to kill Ahimelech, but no one wanted to touch God‚Äôs anointed priest. Doeg stoops to a even lower place, He kills Ahimelech and 85 others who wore priestly garments. What a shame, such betrayal by Doeg. Doeg was ready to do anything to please the King and possibly enhance his own position and win the Kings favor.
We could sometimes sell our selves short, we may accept to do shameful/unlawful/ethical things that may results in personal gain. For example giving a bribe to get some work done. Giving your boss a costly gift to pursue promotion. Sometimes it could be denying Jesus  in order to be accepted in our friend circle.

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mark 8:36

We need to heed the words of Jesus, to be true and genuine disciples of the Lord. We cannot be two timing the Lord or our friends and family. Let us learn to deny ourselves and be honest with ourselves and with everyone. Jesus looks at our heart and know us through and through. There is nothing worth more than our souls, let our actions, thoughts and words reflect what is in our hearts. May we never be tempted to sell ourselves cheap, we are God‚Äôs precious children.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### David Saves Keilah

[![David Saves Keilah](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day114.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qJnOqwxCHRM "David Saves Keilah")

### Day 114 Consult the Lord before you act ‚Äì discernment

We see that David was faced with a big decision to make, he was approached to save the city of Keilah for the Philistines were fighting against Keilah and were robbing the threshing floors. David could have just denied their request as David was not armed (only had Goliath's sword) and only had a bunch of men who were far from an army of any sorts ‚Äì a bunch of afraid men. The below verse describes David‚Äôs arm.
2 And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered themselves unto him. And he became a captain over them, and there were with him about four hundred men. 1 Sam 22:2
David could have just disregarded that ask of the people and redirected them to King Saul. However, David decides not to go with his own thoughts but to consult the Lord instead. He asks the Lord and gets a clear direction to save Keilah, however, he is met with a negative response from his men and counselors. David goes back to the Lord and asks more detailed questions. David goes back and forth with all his doubts about the people betraying him to King Saul.
As we read about David asking the Lord for direction, we cannot help but apply this to our lives. We ought to seek the Lord‚Äôs will on all major things that we take on in life. It‚Äôs called discernment. There are many ways to discern the will of the Lord and it‚Äôs not "a one size fits all".
Some people use the common-sense method of listing out the pros and cons and then evaluating it against God‚Äôs holy teaching, some folks resort to quiet prayers and listening to the Lord, some ask for signs from the Lord, some go with what makes them feel peaceful. Whatever the method, the important thing is to discern God‚Äôs will in everything that we do.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### King Saul is Spared ###

[![King Saul is Spared](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linusjf/BIAY/main/April/jpgs/Day115.jpg)](https://youtu.be/cAVZd_8AucA "King Saul is Spared")

### Day 115 By Cynthia Dsilva

1 Samuel 24:3-21
<https://biblia.com/bible/rsvce/1Samuel/24/3-21>

Saul was consumed with envy.

Envy and jealousy are not the same.

*Jealousy* causes us to wish for the blessings or success which others possess.  It does not necessarily seek the destruction of others.  In fact, jealousy can motivate us to be better than others, which is good.  But sometimes jealousy can cause us to steal the blessings or success which others possess and that is bad.  Jealousy, however, must never progress to envy.

*Envy*, on the other hand, causes us to grieve at someone's blessings or success, and rejoice at someone's sufferings or failures.  Envy causes us to desire the destruction of those who are better than us.  Envy resents the good in others like it was with Cain and Saul.  Envy is a capital sin. 

Saul, the king of a nation, forgot his duty towards the people and gathered 3,000 men, only to run in pursuit of an innocent man, David, from his own kingdom, and to destroy him.  In addition, Saul took pleasure in listening to people who fed him with negative information about David (1 Samuel 24:9). 

How did things get so bad?

It is because Saul was envious of David, and without realizing it he was lowering his own dignity.  

But inspite of all that Saul was doing to destroy David, David did not take revenge on Saul, even when he got a chance to do it because Saul was anointed for the work of God (1 Samuel 24:10).

Are we also like Saul, or are we like David? 
Do we take pleasure in the destruction of others or do we rejoice at the success and blessings received by others? 
Do we take liberty to harm or to speak ill about God's anointed ones (popes, bishops, nuns, clergy, etc.)? 
Let us examine ourselves.

üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

### Day 115 Deal kindly with those who deserve our wrath
King David was treated unjustly by King Saul for some time now. King Saul was perusing him, for no reason. David has a pure heart to serve King Saul. However King Saul tried to kill David many times over, he has killed many people who helped David.
Now Saul was with 3000 men is trying to kill David and goes into a cave to relieve himself. David and his men were already in the cave trying to hide from Saul. David has a very good opportunity to kill Saul, end his misery, and become King of Israel. However, David does not take the easy route, he chooses to spare Saul‚Äôs life, only cutting off a portion of his skirt to prove his faithfulness. David calls Saul 'Father' and reminds him of the honor he has for Saul.
This works ‚Äì I can hear Saul‚Äôs heart melt when he says ‚ÄúIs this your voice, my son David?‚Äù
Saul did not expect this, he said ‚ÄúDavid you are more righteous than me‚Äù. 
Saul even gives David a blessing that David should be the King of Israel.
We should think and act like David. Like David said ‚ÄúHow can I lay a hand on God‚Äôs anointed‚Äù we should also look at a child of God(see Jesus in them) and say ‚ÄúHow can I do or say anything to this brother/sister of mine‚Äù.
We are called to a higher calling by Jesus.
38 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòAn eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.‚Äô 39 But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; 40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; 41 and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. 42 Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you.
43 ‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.‚Äô 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven;
Matt 5:38-45
Let us try our very best to be a good example to our family, friends, and neighbors. If we get angry when others are angry ‚Äì it will only escalate, however, if we give in and let go of our ego it will defuse the situation.
It's easier said than done, let us all pray for strength to do the right thing.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
