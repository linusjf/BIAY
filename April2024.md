### Jephthah's Vow

### Day 92 Jesus our Redeemer

The story of Ruth is lovely, the character that Boaz shows is impeccable. Boaz does not take advantage of Ruth, when she lies down at his feet at the Threshing floor, he even makes sure that her honor is kept “He tells his servant let it not be known that she came here” He is the next in kin and there is someone before him, he offers the immediate next in kin the option to Redeem Naomi’s land and Ruth – but the offer was turned down. So, Boaz steps up and does what is needed, redeeming Naomi’s land and Ruth. Boaz and Ruth marry, and they have a son named Obed. These good people become part of the lineage of Jesus. Obed is the father of Jesse, and the grandfather of David.

Even though Ruth is a Moabitess, the good example and love of her mother-in-law influenced Ruth to be of good character. The Lord blessed her and even included her in the lineage of Jesus.

We should learn from their example and be good witnesses – genuine and true. Only a genuine love for the Lord can draw people to Christ, we will also become a path for others to find Christ, just as Ruth and Boaz become part of the lineage of Jesus.

Just like Naomi’s land and Ruth, we are also in need of redemption. We have committed sin and are in bondage of sin – we have no way to redeem ourselves with our own good deeds, and our debt to pay is very high. That is why we need Jesus, who is the first in kin – the one who will redeem us and restore us to himself. He is our bridegroom, and we are His bride.

At the start of His ministry Jesus reads proclaims that He is the promise that Isiah spoke about.

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free“ Luke 4:18

Jesus our merciful redeemer - we ask that you help us in our weakness and we offer our lives to you, please redeem and save us.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏

### Day 93: Childless couples and IVF

We see the Miracle of another old couple being blessed with a child – the parents of Samson. There are few examples in the bible – where older parents are blessed with a child late in life - Abraham and Sarah, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and Boaz and Ruth – fresh in our memory.

In our modern-day – "instant culture", we see that parents who are childless get impatient and want to have a child at any cost. Now, what is wrong with parents wanting a child and demanding it as a right. The only thing wrong is that a child is a blessing from God. God is our creator and we are co-creators with Him, it was God who initially blessed human beings and said “Be fruitful and multiply” we need to remember that God is in control. But if God is for life and the parents want a child and the church is pro-life why would IVF which is life creating – baby making – not be accepted by the church.

The Church has many reasons for it – it’s based on the moral law of God and His commandments.

The life of a child should always be within the context of the marital act, remember that God is present at all times in a marriage. However with IVF the process to collect the sperm and egg – involves sinful methods and we all know that sin separates us from God. Along with the creation of a physical baby, each baby is given a soul – there is absolutely no way the IVF process has a way to create a soul.

God in His goodness gives the baby a soul, just as God does in the cases of a child born due to rape or fornication. However, that does not mean that God approves of rape and fornication. Something to think about.

Also, IVF has cases where there are multiple embryos and a need for selective abortion.

IVF can be a sensitive topic and I am not an expert on the church’s teachings, just sharing my thoughts based on simple research.

“I respect your opinion if it differs“

God should always be at the center of marriage, and we should be open to life and aware of His presence during the marital act. If you are a couple considering IVF, I would like you to prayerfully consider other options of adopting a deserving child or waiting on the Lord for a child, or dedicating your life more to God’s service.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
