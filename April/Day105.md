### Day 105 ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù

In final moments of Jesus‚Äôs crucifixion, He says these words ‚ÄúI thirst‚Äù just before the final words ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù. Many saints have meditated on these last words of Jesus and we should to. what does Jesus thirst for? Is it for souls?
St Mother Teresa spent her whole live trying to comfort Jesus who thirsts for us.
"I thirst" is something much deeper than Jesus just saying "I love you." Until you know deep inside that Jesus thirsts for you - you can't begin to know who He wants to be for you. Or who He wants you to be for Him. The heart and soul of \[Missionaries of Charity\] is only this - the thirst of Jesus' Heart, hidden in the poor. ... "I thirst" and "You did it to me" - remember always to connect the two. - St Mother Teresa
Mother Teresa spent a whole life serving and her whole congregation are now serving the poor, they see Jesus in the poor and the hungry, those who thirst and those who hunger ‚Äì are feed.
St Faustina united her suffering with the Passion of Christ in order that sinful souls are given the strength to repent.
During Holy Mass, I saw the Lord Jesus nailed upon the cross amidst great torments. A soft moan issued from His Heart. After some time, He said: I thirst. i thirst for the salvation of souls. Help Me, My daughter, to save souls. Join your sufferings to My Passion and offer them to the heavenly Father for sinners (Diary, 1032). - Saint Faustina.
We need to do two things to satisfy the thirst of Jesus.
Repent of our sins and welcome Jesus into our hearts.
Pray for the world and for sinners to repent.
Jesus thirst for us, He thirst for our time, He thirst for our will, He thirsts also to comfort us, to give us rest, He thirsts to come into our hearts and dine with us.
20 Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking; if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me. Rev 3:20
My dear brothers and sisters, do not harden your hearts, pray and welcome Jesus into you lives. He thirsts to come into your hearts and your lives. He thirsts for you to receive Him at Mass, so he can enter you and fill you with love and wholeness.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
