### Day 99 “Word became flesh”, “Canna symbol for resurrection”, “Born again – the right way”

WORD BECAME FLESH

Jesus has been around from the beginning – that is even before the beginning of the world. Jesus is God – He was with the Father and the Holy Spirit during the creation
“Let us make mankind” Gen 1:26.
The Lord has been guiding the people of Israel through generations, God has been speaking His words – words of love, kindness, instruction, commandments. The people are unable to perceive what God is truly like – they are not able to related to words. That is why He send Jesus the
“Word became flesh “ - God living among his people – “Emmanuel – God with us”
We have Jesus healing, feeding, blessing, speaking words of comfort, giving instruction, uplifting the neglected, the outcast, the widow and the orphan, the prostitute, and the tax collector. Jesus is proclaiming that
“All are welcome”
He is the living word of God – Word made flesh. He proves His love for us – love that is greater than any other love – He dies for us – while we were yet sinners.
CANNA IS A SYMBOL OF HIS RESURRECTION
First off we learn that we have a Mother who intercedes for us, she was concerned when the wine ran out, she has been given to us at the cross
“Behold your mother”
so rest assured of her watchfulness and intercession in our lives. This was an earthly sign of her heavenly role in bringing our needs to her son.
The wedding at Canna was the first miracle that Jesus performed, it is very significant as it symbolizes His resurrection. The very first line gives us a big hint
“On the third day there was a marriage at Canna in Galilee” John 2:1
Let’s break it down
– we are all familiar with the third day Jesus rose on the third day - we are all familiar with the wedding feast of the bridegroom (Jesus) and the church (his bride)
– The location – Galilee is key – this is where Jesus meets all the disciples after the resurrection –
(Mark 16 “But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee there you will see him as he told you”)
Jesus here is turning water into wine – symbolic for changing the water – OT rituals into the gift of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. Water can be symbolized as an earthly or human effort of following the law and Spirit can be symbolized as heavenly – Led by the Spirit we are able to live a holy life. Also symbolic of the great sacrifice of the lamb – Jesus Christ is the lamb – Wine changes to Blood – which takes away the sin of the world.
BORN AGAIN
Unlike the common definition of born again – “Believe in your heart and confess with your lips and you will be saved”
Jesus in His own words teaches us how to be born again,
“Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.” John 3:5
Water & Spirit
We can see the water & Spirit theme from Genesis.

1. At the dawn of creation, we see water and Spirit hovering over the waters and this beautiful world was created.
2. Noah and his family passed through the water(flood) and finally they send out the dove to see if there is dry land. The dove is a symbol of Spirit. They are saved again – we have the theme of water and Spirit.
3. We see the Israelites crossing the red sea (water), led by smoke by day and fire by night.
   Smoke and fire are symbols of the Holy Spirit. Again when they are saved we have the theme of water and Spirit.
4. Israelites Crossing the Jordan to the promised Land
5. Jesus was baptized – in the water of Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down like a dove.
6. So you are being saved by BAPTISM, really initiated to be saved. (Water baptism)
7. Then you are confirmed with the Holy Spirit in the sacrament of confirmation. (Spirit baptism)
8. Then you periodically cleanse yourself in the Sacrament of Confession
9. You nourish yourself by receiving Jesus' Body and Blood in the Sacrament of the Eucharist.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us 🙏
