### Day 93: Childless couples and IVF

We see the Miracle of another old couple being blessed with a child – the parents of Samson. There are few examples in the bible – where older parents are blessed with a child late in life - Abraham and Sarah, Zechariah and Elizabeth, and Boaz and Ruth – fresh in our memory.

In our modern-day – "instant culture", we see that parents who are childless get impatient and want to have a child at any cost. Now, what is wrong with parents wanting a child and demanding it as a right. The only thing wrong is that a child is a blessing from God. God is our creator and we are co-creators with Him, it was God who initially blessed human beings and said “Be fruitful and multiply” we need to remember that God is in control. But if God is for life and the parents want a child and the church is pro-life why would IVF which is life creating – baby making – not be accepted by the church.

The Church has many reasons for it – it’s based on the moral law of God and His commandments.

The life of a child should always be within the context of the marital act, remember that God is present at all times in a marriage. However with IVF the process to collect the sperm and egg – involves sinful methods and we all know that sin separates us from God. Along with the creation of a physical baby, each baby is given a soul – there is absolutely no way the IVF process has a way to create a soul.

God in His goodness gives the baby a soul, just as God does in the cases of a child born due to rape or fornication. However, that does not mean that God approves of rape and fornication. Something to think about.

Also, IVF has cases where there are multiple embryos and a need for selective abortion.

IVF can be a sensitive topic and I am not an expert on the church’s teachings, just sharing my thoughts based on simple research.

“I respect your opinion if it differs“

God should always be at the center of marriage, and we should be open to life and aware of His presence during the marital act. If you are a couple considering IVF, I would like you to prayerfully consider other options of adopting a deserving child or waiting on the Lord for a child, or dedicating your life more to God’s service.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
