### Day 119 Always turn to the Lord for guidance

David till now has shown great character, he has been trying to make peace with Saul ‚Äì sparing Saul‚Äôs life a few times over. It takes two hands to clap, and sometimes in life if the other party just does not want to make peace, there is little that we can do, we have to just pray and offer them to the Lord. That is what David did and eventually, we see the bad end of Saul‚Äôs life, even Saul‚Äôs sons died in battle.
While Saul was doing everything wrong, consulting diviners and breaking his own rules. David on the other hand is doing the right thing, when the Philistines invaded Ziklag and took all the women and children including David‚Äôs wives, David did not go after them in haste ‚Äì to avenge and bring back all the families.
David put on the Ephod ‚Äì priests' cloths and consulted the Lord in prayer. This is so important, let me say it again, ‚ÄúThis is so important‚Äù the key between doing the right and wrong thing is consulting the Lord and turning to God for guidance.
Let us constantly turn to God for His guidance and will. We are called to be led by the Holy Spirit because those who are led by the Spirit are God‚Äôs children.
because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. Rom 8:15
When we come to the crossroads of life, there are always many roads to take. Some lead to good and some to evil, we know that we should always avoid the road that leads to evil. But which good road should we take, only the Holy Spirit can guide you to do God‚Äôs will. The Holy Spirit will use people, and events and also prompt you directly, the key is to be in tune with the Holy Spirit.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. Gal 5:25
Let us not be like Alice in Wonderland ‚Äì who at a crossroad did not know which road to take, when the bunny asked her where do you want to go, she said does not matter. Then the bunny replied ‚Äì then it does not matter which road you should take.
‚ÄúIf we are failing to plan then we are planning to fail ‚Äú
Let us not be blown in any direction by the winds of this world, but let us be moved by the breath of God, the Holy Spirit.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
