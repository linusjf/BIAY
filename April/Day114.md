### Day 114 Consult the Lord before you act ‚Äì discernment

We see that David was faced with a big decision to make, he was approached to save the city of Keilah for the Philistines were fighting against Keilah and were robbing the threshing floors. David could have just denied their request as David was not armed (only had Goliath's sword) and only had a bunch of men who were far from an army of any sorts ‚Äì a bunch of afraid men. The below verse describes David‚Äôs arm.
2 And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered themselves unto him. And he became a captain over them, and there were with him about four hundred men. 1 Sam 22:2
David could have just disregarded that ask of the people and redirected them to King Saul. However, David decides not to go with his own thoughts but to consult the Lord instead. He asks the Lord and gets a clear direction to save Keilah, however, he is met with a negative response from his men and counselors. David goes back to the Lord and asks more detailed questions. David goes back and forth with all his doubts about the people betraying him to King Saul.
As we read about David asking the Lord for direction, we cannot help but apply this to our lives. We ought to seek the Lord‚Äôs will on all major things that we take on in life. It‚Äôs called discernment. There are many ways to discern the will of the Lord and it‚Äôs not "a one size fits all".
Some people use the common-sense method of listing out the pros and cons and then evaluating it against God‚Äôs holy teaching, some folks resort to quiet prayers and listening to the Lord, some ask for signs from the Lord, some go with what makes them feel peaceful. Whatever the method, the important thing is to discern God‚Äôs will in everything that we do.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
