### Day 96 Failing to correct our children

The famous parenting proverb from the bible is

Whoever spares the rod hates their children, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them. Prov 13:24

Like many things in the Bible this proverb is hyperbole, I don’t think God wants us to beat our kids with a rod.

What it really means is we need to take responsibility for our kids – young or old, we cannot ignore their mistakes, we cannot just tell them they are wrong, what we have to do is insist, pray and hopefully get them to repent.

We see Eli trying to correct his sons – they were having relations with the women who worked at the entrance of the tent of the meeting, this is similar to committing adultery in front of the blessed sacrament, these sons of Eli have no respect for the Lord.

I guess Eli told them but they didn’t listen, Eli was old and maybe not persistent with his parenting skills. We as parents need to learn from this, if not the Lord’s favor will not rest on our family. We need to have rules and enforce them, it is easy to give in to our kids and let them do what they want. But that is not our calling or duty as parents. I remember what my mom always told me

“If you bring a soul into this world, you are responsible for it” Lois Eltham.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
