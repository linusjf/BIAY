### Day 95: Relativism brings Chaos

NOTE: THIS EPISODE IS PG-RATED

We see one of the lowest, most gruesome episodes of the Bible in Judges. This terrible state of lawlessness was due to the fact -

“In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.” Judges 21:25

Gruesome stuff, feel overwhelmed to even summarize what happened. There was a Levite who had a concubine – this in itself is wrong, then the concubine left the Levite and went back to her father's house. The Levite went to bring her back, however, her father prevented the Levite from leaving with his daughter(we do not know the back story -may be the Levite was ill-treating her).

They eventually left and went to the tribe of Benjamin. This is where the unthinkable happened, the evil men wanted to have relations with the Levites – which is wrong again.

The Levite and his host acted cowardly - and pushed out the concubine. The gang of men abused her all night and she was found dead in the morning at the door. The Levite cuts up her body into pieces and sends them to all of Israel and every tribe goes up to fight against Benjamin – which is another tribe. Now, these other tribes go into the city and kill all of the Benjaminite women. Which is also very shameful.

The whole episode is just wrong. It’s a state of Chaos!!!

The root cause of this is “RELATIVISM” – every man did what is right in his own mind.

Sadly, relativism has crept into our lives today. Most people just want to do what they want. Relativism has crept into the faith circles as well. There are so many denominations that seem to interpret the bible differently and if someone is not in terms with the pastor, a new sub-division is born and a "new church" with the doctrine that they like.

Even within the catholic church – relativism has crept in. There is a growing population that wants women priests and deacons, gay and lesbian marriages to be blessed, and many want IVF and contraception to be permitted by the catholic church. Also, some do not believe in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and some do not go to confession.

And the motto of everyone has become “live and let live” – meaning you live your life according to your thoughts and I will live mine. The problem here is that people are taking the place of God and setting their own standards and beliefs, this is the reason there is division in the church, families, and society.

We need to return to the one source of truth, which is Jesus Christ. We need to adhere to the magisterium of the church, whose head is Jesus Christ. No teaching of the catholic church would be against the Bible – God’s holy word – but we cannot lock God in a book and say the Bible is the authority – even the bible does not claim that.

“The solution to relativism is authority” - Michael Eltham 😀

The authority of the catholic church was instituted by Jesus when He gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and the promise that what would be bound on earth will be bound in heaven. In the old testament, the spiritual leaders of Israel had that role where they would bind something into law and agree and disagree on matters. Today that role is given to the catholic church, we should be so glad that our faith, teaching, and doctrine have been authorized by Jesus himself and passed down from generation to generation through the hands of many saints.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
