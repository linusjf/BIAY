Fr. Mike talks about how revenge and violence can become a cycle that doesn't end until someone chooses to end it. He also points out how the genealogy in 1 Chronicles reflects the genealogy of Christ.The reading for today are 2 Samuel 2, 1 Chronicles 2, and Psalm 24.

### Day 121 Be a pioneer in doing the right thing

Judah was always what went up first when Israel marched into battle. Judah means praise and it should be the same with us as well, when we pray ‚Äì praise should always go up first before any petitions. Judah is again the first to instate David as King, we read that David was anointed to be king but was very humbly and patiently waiting for God‚Äôs time. Judah in a way is a pioneer in doing the correct thing first. We are called to be pioneers as well, to be zealous for the Lord. We should be on the lookout for opportunities to serve God and His people.
There is this famous saying ‚ÄúIf the devil can‚Äôt make you bad, he will make you evil.‚Äù
We need to be available for the Lord, we need to have the attitude of ‚ÄúSpeak Lord I am listening‚Äù, because
‚ÄúThe Lord does not call the qualified, but He qualifies the called‚Äù.
God may be calling you to do something you have never done before, or you feel you are not unable to do.
‚ÄúWe are called to be faithful and not successful; success or failure is what God takes care of‚Äù
Be a pioneer and a leader in doing good things for the Lord. May we have the courage and faith to say ‚ÄúFor me and my house, we will serve the Lord‚Äù. Even if we face a lot of resistance from family, friends, and society, we need to keep on moving forward.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Mat 6:33
One important thing as pioneers is "to do God‚Äôs will".
We see Judah proclaimed David as King, however, the commander of Saul took Ish-bosheth and made him king over all of Israel. As we continue to read we will see that only God‚Äôs ‚Äòwill‚Äô prevails and David will become king of the whole of Isreal. Let us be a pioneer in doing God‚Äôs will not doing as we wish.
Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain Ps 127:1
May the Holy Spirit Lead us. üôè
