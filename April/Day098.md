### Day 98 My will be done, my kingdom come

We pray the Our Father every day, maybe several times a day even. The 'Our father' Jesus taught us has “Thy Kingdom come thy will be done” however we sometimes tend to do our own will instead of the will of God.
We have been studying the OT and the journey the Israelites made from Egypt to the Promised land, they had no king – the Lord was their King, He led them out of slavery and defeated Egypt and every nation that came Israelites' way, nations far stronger than themselves.
The Lord gave them many Judges and looks like the sons of the Judges keep messing up time and again – we saw Eli’s sons messed up a few chapters ago and the "ark of the covenant " was taken away. Now it's Samuel’s sons - they are not judging properly taking bribes and are corrupt. The people are tired of it and want a King like the other nations in the world.
The Lord is the best King, the other nations could not even hold on to the ark of the covenant they had to gracefully send it back. All the nations around knew the power of God, but the people of Israel ask for a king.
They are focusing on the world and asking God to do what they want. “My will be done, my kingdom come”. They say – other nations have a king, give us a king. They are literally asking for a replacement of God.
This could be the case with us as well, we look at the different things people have, and people do and ask the Lord – I want it. We sometimes look at our lives and compare them to friends and others and complain that “they are richer”, “He is healthier”, “She is more beautiful than me”, and “our neighbor's lawn is greener”. Let us seek God’s will in everything – just like Jesus our thoughts should be
“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. John 4:34
Even when things get tough, we should persist through it. Pray as Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane - in sweat and blood.
My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will” Mat 26:39
We can pray for anything as we have a loving Father, however, if it's God’s will that we suffer or face difficulties, so be it – let us press on and keep the faith. May our prayer be, Lord “Thy will be done and Thy kingdom come”
May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
