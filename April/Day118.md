### Day 118 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted

Psalm 34 is one of those Psalms that we need to read daily and remember. It reminds us to praise God every day and for everything, in fact, it prescribes us to praise God ‚Äúalways‚Äù. We are invited not to boast of our own victories, but rather humble ourselves and boast in the Lord alone. We can invite others to praise God with us and invite them to magnify the Lord and exalt the Lord in unity and with joy.
I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. Ps 34:1-3
There are times when it‚Äôs hard to praise God, when things go wrong or when we are caught up in sin. Do not despair or stop praising God, for He will answer us when we call to Him. He will deliver us from all our fears, when we cry out he will hear us, when we are in trouble he will save us, save us from every trouble; he will put angels in charge over us who will encamp around us; those who take refuge in him will be happy; those who look to him are radiant, their faces never covered with shame. Even if the young lion suffers, those who trust in the Lord will lack nothing that is good.
I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 5 Look to him, and be radiant; so your faces shall never be ashamed. 6 This poor soul cried, and was heard by the Lord, and was saved from every trouble. 7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 8 O taste and see that the Lord is good; happy are those who take refuge in him. 9 O fear the Lord, you his holy ones, for those who fear him have no want. 10 The young lions suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
Remember the Lord is near to the brokenhearted, he saves those who are crushed in spirit. The next time you feel broken-hearted and crushed in your spirit, remember that the Lord is close to you. I join the psalmist today to invite you to taste and see that the Lord is good.
The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. 18
O taste and see that the Lord is good; 8
May the Holy Spirit lead us üôè
