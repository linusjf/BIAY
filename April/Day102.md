### Day 102: The Good Shepherd

The promise of the Good Shepherd from the OT in Psalm 23 “The Lord is my shepherd I shall not be in want” is fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus proclaims that in today’s Gospel

“I am the good shepherd – the one who lays down His life for the sheep”. John 10:11

The good shepherd cares for the sheep – He feeds them in green pastures, by quiet waters.

He leads them on the right path, protects them in the dark valley.

The shepherd also corrects and comforts the sheep with His rod and staff.

When a sheep goes astray – He goes in search of the sheep – and finds it and carries it back home. He restores their soul – forgives their sins - washes them in His blood and makes them whole.

There is rejoicing in heaven over every sheep that is found – He anoints our head with oil, prepares a banquet, our cup is overflowing, surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life, and on the day we pass from this world to the next – we will go in though Him - for He said

“I am the door of the sheep, if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture” John 10: 9

We have to teach our hearts and mind to listen to Him and follow Him. We also should be aware of the voice of the evil one – who only wants to rob, steal, and destroy us. We should set time for silent listening every day and also be aware of the promptings and the nudges of the Holy Spirit throughout the day.

God wants us to give us life in abundance and he also tells us that there are many who need to come into the flock. Everyone needs to hear His voice in prayer and hear Him as we read the Bible. We need to experience the life-giving word of God. Just as Lazarus came to life just by hearing Jesus’s voice, we need to come alive in many areas of our life as we hear God’s voice spoken to us.

All we need to do is pay attention to His voice and stay close to Him, He will provide, protect, guide, and lead us to the safe bosom of Abba Father.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. 🙏
