### Day 101 Jesus and His Mercy for the women caught in adultery

As we read the story of the women caught in adultery we can‚Äôt help but awe at the Mercy of God. First off Jesus sees deeper, He knows our hearts. He knew the hidden motive of the Pharisees, who wanted to actually trap Jesus.
First of all, it is not easy to catch someone in the act of adultery, people seek privacy for the marital act ‚Äì so much more for adultery. So for the Pharisees to find the women in the act would actually mean they have been looking to catch them and they did not find them by accident.
The second question is ‚Äúwhere is the man?‚Äù, the law was to stone both of them, not just the women. Maybe the elders were trying to frame this poor woman or even if they actually caught her in the act ‚Äì they are being very partial to the man.
While the elders stand with raised stones and with wrath in their hearts, looking down on the woman. Jesus on the other hand bends down and writes on the sand, Jesus humbles himself to the level of the woman and looks at her with Mercy ‚Äì does not look down on her.
As the men press on for Jesus to condemn and stone her, Jesus writes on the dust ‚Äì the word of God does not specify what He wrote ‚Äì however there are some assumptions we can make

1. At creation we know what happened when God touched dust and breathed on it ‚Äì "man was created".
   7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.Gen 2: 7
   Here Jesus is God touching dust again ‚Äì He is creating a new opportunity for the women - a brand new life ‚Äì He makes everything new ‚Äì wipes her slate clean and gives her a new chance at life.
2. The other time God‚Äôs finger touched the earth, He write laws on the stone tablets. Jesus - God is writing again - maybe the laws ‚Äì maybe even writing the new law ‚Äì the old law said if you commit adultery ‚Äì the new law Jesus gave is ‚Äúeven if you look at a woman with lust you have committed adultery in your heart‚Äù so maybe the elder who caught the women in the act ‚Äì lusted over her. They could not throw a stone anymore as they would need to be stoned as well.
   MY DEAR BROTHERS AND SISTERS ‚Äì BE ENCOURAGED AND NOT DISCOURAGED ‚Äì ‚ÄúGOD IS MERCIFUL‚Äù.
   He came not to condemn but to save. He came to forgive us or not to judge us like a merciless judge. He is a Merciful Judge that has compassion for broken creatures like us.
   May we also be like Jesus, quick to forgive and slow to judge and condemn.
   May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè

### Day 101 - George Vysamparambil

8:8 wrote ....on the ground: What Jesus inscribed in the dirt is unknown but probably symbolic. The gesture may recall Jer 17:13, a warning that those who forsake the Lord "shall be written in the earth" because they have rejected the "fountain of living water". The Pharisees fall into this category for rejecting Jesus, who has just been identified as the source of "living water" (7:38). Christ, who twice bends down to write on the ground, teaches us to bend low in humility to examine ourselves both before and after addressing the faults of our neighbour. If his example becomes our pratice, we will avoid as he did the extremes of being unjust and unmerciful toward others
