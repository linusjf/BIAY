### Day 112 A Faithful Friend is a treasure

Family is given to us, but Friends are our choice. It is very important to choose the correct friends for they can save our lives or ruin them.
We see the friendship of David and Jonathan, they were true friends. They both had faith and courageous hearts, they were ready to do anything for the Lord. Jonathan has tried to unite his father Saul and David but to no avail. Jonathan is willing to stand up for David to the point where Saul even throws a spear at him. Jonathan was a true friend because he was ready to risk his own life for his friend David.
We have a true friend in Jesus, who while we were yet sinners He died for us. Jesus is our true friend because he gave us everything, he stood up for us even to the point of death.
There is no greater love than to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.John 15:13
If we don‚Äôt spend time with our friends we will never grow deep in friendship.
It‚Äôs the same with our relationship with Jesus, we need to spend time praying, talking, and listening to His word and to His promptings. We need to talk to Jesus about every little thing that happens to us and know that He is with us every moment of the day and night.
We should also pray for good friends for us and good friends for our children/grandchildren. We should look for friends who have faith, friends who are faithful, friends who we can depend on, and share our burdens and joys. Friends who we can celebrate our life events with. Not friends with benefits or friends who can do us a favor, we need true friendships ‚Äì where there is no judgment.
We should find a friend who is closer than a brother, not friends who will ruin us.
One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. Prov 18:24
These verses from Sirach are true wisdom, let them be our guide to find those friends, that are a sturdy shelter, the faithful friends who are a treasure.
Friendship, False and True
5 Pleasant speech multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue multiplies courtesies. 6 Let those who are friendly with you be many, but let your advisers be one in a thousand. 7 When you gain friends, gain them through testing, and do not trust them hastily. 8 For there are friends who are such when it suits them, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 9 And there are friends who change into enemies, and tell of the quarrel to your disgrace. 10 And there are friends who sit at your table, but they will not stand by you in time of trouble. 11 When you are prosperous, they become your second self, and lord it over your servants; 12 but if you are brought low, they turn against you, and hide themselves from you. 13 Keep away from your enemies, and be on guard with your friends.
14 Faithful friends are a sturdy shelter: whoever finds one has found a treasure. 15 Faithful friends are beyond price; no amount can balance their worth. 16 Faithful friends are life-saving medicine; and those who fear the Lord will find them. 17 Those who fear the Lord direct their friendship aright, for as they are, so are their neighbors also.
Sirach 6:51-17
May we be Jesus‚Äôs true friend, as He stands knocking at the door of our hearts.
May we also find true spiritual friends in this world.
And ‚Äúyes‚Äù we are all true friends in the BIAY group ‚Äì praying for each other and growing in our friendship with Jesus.
May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
