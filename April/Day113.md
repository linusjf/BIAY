### Day 113 ‚ÄúCrossing the limit‚Äù to succeed

We read about David and his men, eating the bread of the presence as they had nothing else to eat as they were fleeing Saul. We also need the bread of the presence ‚Äì Eucharist to strengthen us on our journey.
Saul finds out about it and is perusing David, he is furious and wants to find out who helped David. When no one answered ‚Äì ‚ÄúDoeg‚Äù ceased the opportunity to please the King. Doeg tells Saul that Ahimelech was the one who helped David. Saul wanted his servants to kill Ahimelech, but no one wanted to touch God‚Äôs anointed priest. Doeg stoops to a even lower place, He kills Ahimelech and 85 others who wore priestly garments. What a shame, such betrayal by Doeg. Doeg was ready to do anything to please the King and possibly enhance his own position and win the Kings favor.
We could sometimes sell our selves short, we may accept to do shameful/unlawful/ethical things that may results in personal gain. For example giving a bribe to get some work done. Giving your boss a costly gift to pursue promotion. Sometimes it could be denying Jesus  in order to be accepted in our friend circle.

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Mark 8:36

We need to heed the words of Jesus, to be true and genuine disciples of the Lord. We cannot be two timing the Lord or our friends and family. Let us learn to deny ourselves and be honest with ourselves and with everyone. Jesus looks at our heart and know us through and through. There is nothing worth more than our souls, let our actions, thoughts and words reflect what is in our hearts. May we never be tempted to sell ourselves cheap, we are God‚Äôs precious children.

May the Holy Spirit lead us. üôè
